     Christopher H. Franklin           Chairman, President, and           Chief Executive Officer    LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS   Dear Fellow Shareholder, I believe when we look back at the history          of Aqua America, 2018 will stand out as a momentous year in our company's story. In the span of one year, Aqua closed on          six municipal acquisitions, welcomed our 1-millionth customer connection, and announced our entry into the natural gas distribution          business thorough our acquisition of Pittsburgh-based natural gas company Peoples for $4.275 billion. Today, Aqua is a leader in rebuilding          infrastructure and delivering safe and reliable water and wastewater services to our customers in the communities we serve. We          remain committed to delivering on our promises to our customers, employees, the communities where we live and work, and you, our          shareholders. Over the last few years, Aqua has experienced          tremendous growth – with all our subsidiaries and employees working together. Collaboration across disciplines and geography          has always led to the greatest successes for this company, and I'm grateful to be leading this organization as we continue          to grow together in the years to come. Looking ahead, 2019 is poised to          be another exciting and important year for Aqua, as we continue to successfully operate and grow our water and wastewater          business, while also establishing ourselves in the natural gas industry. We understand the responsibility and opportunity we          have to protect public health, the environment and the lives of our customers each and every day. Across the organization,          our team of professionals works together to provide safe and reliable water to our customers, and to return treated          wastewater to the environment in better condition than when we removed it. And this year, we look forward to welcoming and          getting to know the employees and customers of Peoples. All these successes take dedication at          every level of our organization. I am extremely proud of our employees, the leadership team, and our board of directors who are          instrumental in helping chart our course. In August 2018, we appointed two new directors who will come up for election for the          first time at our annual meeting: Elizabeth B. Amato and Lee C. Stewart. Beth, a seasoned human resources executive, and Lee, a          financial consultant, both have contributed to and enabled our vision of excellence. In addition, a new director nominee is presented          for election by the shareholders at this meeting, Christopher C. Womack, president of external affairs for Southern Company, an          Atlanta-based energy company. These individuals and all our accomplished directors bring a superior caliber of thought leadership          that benefits Aqua and its customers, employees, and shareholders. I'd like to express my deep appreciation          to outgoing directors Carolyn J. Burke, William P. Hankowsky, and Wendell F. Holland for their service to our board. Carolyn, who          has served since 2016, Bill, who has served since 2004, and Wendell, who has served since 2011, have helped guide Aqua into a new          era and I wish them well as they move on to new endeavors. We look forward to seeing you at our 2019          Annual Meeting of Shareholders which will be held on Thursday, May 2, 2019 at the Omni Richmond Hotel, 100 South 12th Street, Richmond,          Virginia 23219 at 8:00 a.m. local time. In connection with the Annual Meeting,          we have prepared a Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a Proxy Statement, and our 2018 Annual Report. On or about March 22,          2019, we began mailing to our shareholders these materials or a Notice of Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions          on how to access these materials online. Whether you plan on attending the Annual          Meeting in person or not, we encourage you to read the Proxy Statement and all other materials and vote your shares. You may vote          over the Internet, by telephone, or, if you received or requested to receive printed proxy materials, by signing, dating, and returning          the proxy card enclosed with the proxy materials in the postage-paid envelope that is provided. On behalf of the senior leadership team,          board of directors, and our team of employees who supports Aqua's mission each day, thank you to our shareholders for your          confidence, trust and support. Sincerely, Christopher H. Franklin

We          remain committed to delivering on our promises to our customers, employees, the communities where we live and work, and you, our          shareholders. Over the last few years, Aqua has experienced          tremendous growth – with all our subsidiaries and employees working together. Collaboration across disciplines and geography          has always led to the greatest successes for this company, and I'm grateful to be leading this organization as we continue          to grow together in the years to come. Looking ahead, 2019 is poised to          be another exciting and important year for Aqua, as we continue to successfully operate and grow our water and wastewater          business, while also establishing ourselves in the natural gas industry. We understand the responsibility and opportunity we          have to protect public health, the environment and the lives of our customers each and every day. Across the organization,          our team of professionals works together to provide safe and reliable water to our customers, and to return treated          wastewater to the environment in better condition than when we removed it. And this year, we look forward to welcoming and          getting to know the employees and customers of Peoples. All these successes take dedication at          every level of our organization. I am extremely proud of our employees, the leadership team, and our board of directors who are          instrumental in helping chart our course. In August 2018, we appointed two new directors who will come up for election for the          first time at our annual meeting: Elizabeth B. Amato and Lee C. Stewart. Beth, a seasoned human resources executive, and Lee, a          financial consultant, both have contributed to and enabled our vision of excellence. In addition, a new director nominee is presented          for election by the shareholders at this meeting, Christopher C. Womack, president of external affairs for Southern Company, an          Atlanta-based energy company. These individuals and all our accomplished directors bring a superior caliber of thought leadership          that benefits Aqua and its customers, employees, and shareholders. I'd like to express my deep appreciation          to outgoing directors Carolyn J. Burke, William P. Hankowsky, and Wendell F. Holland for their service to our board. Carolyn, who          has served since 2016, Bill, who has served since 2004, and Wendell, who has served since 2011, have helped guide Aqua into a new          era and I wish them well as they move on to new endeavors. We look forward to seeing you at our 2019          Annual Meeting of Shareholders which will be held on Thursday, May 2, 2019 at the Omni Richmond Hotel, 100 South 12th Street, Richmond,          Virginia 23219 at 8:00 a.m. local time. In connection with the Annual Meeting,          we have prepared a Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a Proxy Statement, and our 2018 Annual Report. On or about March 22,          2019, we began mailing to our shareholders these materials or a Notice of Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions          on how to access these materials online. Whether you plan on attending the Annual          Meeting in person or not, we encourage you to read the Proxy Statement and all other materials and vote your shares. You may vote          over the Internet, by telephone, or, if you received or requested to receive printed proxy materials, by signing, dating, and returning          the proxy card enclosed with the proxy materials in the postage-paid envelope that is provided. On behalf of the senior leadership team,          board of directors, and our team of employees who supports Aqua's mission each day, thank you to our shareholders for your          confidence, trust and support. Sincerely, Christopher H. Franklin

The Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders are available at: http://ir.aquaamerica.com/
AQUA AMERICA, INC.
762 W. Lancaster Avenue, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania 19010
Proxy Statement
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Aqua America, Inc. ("Aqua America", "Aqua" or the "Company") to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Thursday, May 2, 2019 at 8:00 a.m., local time at The Omni Richmond Hotel, 100 South 12th Street, Richmond, Virginia 23219, and at any adjournments or postponements thereof ("2019 Annual Meeting" or the "Annual Meeting").
The cost of soliciting proxies will be paid by the Company, which has arranged for reimbursement at the rate suggested by the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") of brokerage houses, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries for the forwarding of proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares held of record. In addition, the Company has retained Alliance Advisors LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies from (i) brokers, bank nominees and other institutional holders, and (ii) individual holders of record. The fee paid to Alliance Advisors LLC for normal proxy solicitation does not exceed $8,000 plus expenses, which will be paid by the Company. Directors, officers and regular employees of the Company may solicit proxies, although no compensation will be paid by the Company for such efforts.
Under rules adopted by the SEC, the Company is furnishing proxy materials to many of its shareholders via the Internet, rather than mailing printed copies of those materials to each shareholder. If you received a notice of availability over the Internet of the proxy materials ("Notice") by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request one. Instead, the Notice will instruct you as to how you may access and review the proxy materials on the Internet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice. The Notice is being sent to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2019 on or about March 22, 2019. Proxy materials, which include the Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders, this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018, including financial statements and other information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Annual Report"), are first being made available to shareholders of record as of March 4, 2019, on or about March 22, 2019. Additional copies of the Annual Report may be obtained by writing to the Company at the address and in the manner set forth under "Additional Information" on page 66.
PURPOSE OF THE MEETING
As the meeting is the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the shareholders of the Company will be requested to:
All of the director nominees who are elected, will be elected for a one-year term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. In accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Chairperson of the Corporate Governance Committee reported to the Corporate Governance Committee that Elizabeth B. Amato, Nicholas DeBenedictis, Christopher H. Franklin, Daniel J. Hilferty, Ellen T. Ruff, Lee C. Stewart and Christopher C. Womack would be willing to serve on the Board of Directors, if elected. Mr. Womack was recommended as a first-time director nominee by a third-party search firm. The Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the qualifications of the director nominees in relation to the criteria for candidates for nomination for election to the Board of Directors under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance Committee voted to recommend to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, the nomination of Ms. Amato, Mr. DeBenedictis, Mr. Franklin, Mr. Hilferty, Ms. Ruff, Mr. Stewart, and Mr. Womack for election as directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting, with each nominee abstaining from the vote with respect to his or her nomination, as applicable.
Therefore, seven nominees will stand for election by a plurality of the votes cast at the 2019 Annual Meeting. At the 2019 Annual Meeting, proxies in the accompanying form, properly executed, will be voted for the election of the seven nominees listed below, unless authority to do so has been withheld in the manner specified in the instructions on the proxy card or the record holder does not have discretionary voting power under the NYSE rules (see "What is the proxy?" on page 61 and "Information About Proposals Under Consideration at This Meeting" on page 63). Discretionary authority is reserved to cast votes for the election of a substitute should any nominee be unable or become unwilling to serve as a director. Each nominee has stated his or her willingness to serve and the Company believes that the nominees will be available to serve.
Information Regarding Nominees
For each of the seven nominees for election as directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting, set forth below is information as to the positions and offices with the Company held by each, the principal occupation of each during at least the past five years, the directorships of public companies and other organizations held by each and the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that, in the opinion of the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors, make the individual qualified to serve as a director of the Company.

Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors operates pursuant to a set of written Corporate Governance Guidelines. Copies of these Guidelines can be obtained free of charge from the Corporate Governance portion of the Investor Relations section of the Company's website: www.aquaamerica.com. Our website is not part of this Proxy Statement. References to our website address in this Proxy Statement are intended to be inactive textual references only.
Director Independence
The Board of Directors is, among other things, responsible for determining whether each of the directors is independent in light of any relationship such director may have with the Company. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that contain categorical standards of director independence that are consistent with the listing standards of the NYSE. Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, a director will not be deemed independent if:
For purposes of the categorical standards set forth above (a) a person's immediate family includes a person's spouse, parents, children, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, and brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares such person's home, (b) the term "executive officer" has the same meaning specified for the term "officer" in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act, and (c) the "Company" includes Aqua and its consolidated subsidiaries. In addition to these categorical standards, no director will be considered independent unless the Board of Directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the Company (either directly, or as a partner, shareholder, director or officer, of an organization that has a relationship with the Company). When making independence determinations, the Board of Directors broadly considers all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding any relationship between a director or nominee and the Company. Transactions, relationships and arrangements between directors or members of their immediate family and the Company that are not addressed by the categorical standards may be material depending on the relevant facts and circumstances of such transactions, relationships and arrangements. The Board of Directors considered the following transactions, relationships and arrangements in connection with making the independence determinations for the current Board of Directors:
Corporate Governance
Under the self-insured nature of the medical plans, the Company also submitted payments to IHG to maintain the necessary insurance reserves and to pay medical claims made for such years. As administrator, these payments were "pass through" payments and do not represent compensation to, or revenue of, IHG. The following "pass through" payments were made to IHG in the last three fiscal years:
Mr. Hilferty is President and Chief Executive Officer of IHG. The amounts paid by the Company to IHG are not material to IHG or to the Company.
Based on a review applying the standards set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, including a review of the applicable NYSE, SEC, and Company standards, and considering the relevant facts and circumstances of the transactions, relationships, and arrangements between the directors and the Company described above, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each director and nominee for director, other than Mr. Franklin, the Company's Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. DeBenedictis, the Company's Chairman Emeritus and former Chief Executive Officer, is independent.
Board of Directors Leadership Structure
In 2017, the Board of Directors determined to recombine the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Currently, Mr. Franklin serves as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board of Directors believes this structure provides continuity and efficiency for the Company, while providing clear accountability to the execution of the Company's strategy and its results. Under this present structure, the Board of Directors annually elects a Lead Independent Director to coordinate the activities of the other independent directors and enhance the role of the independent directors in the overall corporate governance of the Company. At the same time that Mr. Franklin was appointed Chairman, Mr. Hilferty was elected the Lead Independent Director. In 2018, Mr. Hilferty was re-elected as Lead Independent Director.
The duties and powers of the Lead Independent Director include:
Corporate Governance
Age and Term Limits
The Board believes that term limits are an important element of good governance. However, it also believes that it must strike the appropriate balance between the contribution of directors who have developed, over a period of time, meaningful insight into the Company and its operations, and therefore can provide an increasing contribution to the Board as a whole. Accordingly, in 2015, the Board established that upon the fifteenth anniversary of a director accepting an initial appointment or election to the Board of Directors, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the Board (the "Term Limit Policy"). The Term Limit Policy does not apply to directors who were elected on or before December 1, 2015.
In 2017, the Board also re-evaluated its position on mandatory retirement based upon the age of a director. Following extensive research, including conducting an outreach program to the Company's largest shareholders in which the Company sought the opinion of those shareholders, the Board determined that increasing the age for a director to submit his or her resignation from the Board of Directors to 75 was appropriate. As such, all directors are required to submit their resignation from the Board effective as of their 75th birthday.
Annual Peer, Committee, Board Evaluation
Each year, directors complete a targeted questionnaire to assess the performance of the Board and each of the standing Committees. Every second year, directors complete a targeted questionnaire to assess the performance of the directors individually. Both questionnaires elicit quantitative and qualitative ratings in key areas of Board operation and function. Each Committee member completes questions to evaluate how well the Committees on which he or she serves are functioning and to provide suggestions for improvement.
In 2018, the Lead Independent Director and the Chairman met with each director, provided the results of the evaluations to each director, and discussed the director's participation, preparation, and performance.
Shareholder Engagement
In 2018, the Company continued its governance outreach campaign to our top 25 shareholders. We engaged with every shareholder who accepted our offer to meet. We covered numerous topics, including executive compensation matters, merger and acquisition strategy, the impact of Pennsylvania's anti-takeover laws on such strategy, sustainability, and social and governance issues. In addition to the annual governance campaign, as a part of its investor relations program management met with over 125 institutional holders, participated in 10 conferences, and conducted various retail shareholder efforts.
Director Onboarding
In 2018, the Company appointed Ms. Amato and Mr. Stewart as directors. In addition to informal meetings with the existing directors, and in conjunction with their appointment, Ms. Amato and Mr. Stewart participated in an onboarding process that included in-depth meetings with the named executive officers focused on items such as mergers and acquisition strategy, regulatory matters, utility accounting and financing, water and wastewater operations, Board governance functions, Pennsylvania law, and the Company's Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Oversight of Risk Management
The Board oversees management's risk management activities through a combination of processes:
Corporate Governance
The Board believes that the present leadership structure, along with the important risk oversight functions performed by management, the Audit Committee, the Risk Mitigation and Investment Policy Committee, the Executive Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee and the full Board, permits the Board to effectively perform its role in the risk oversight of the Company.
Code of Ethics
In 2018, the Company updated its Code of Ethical Business Conduct for its directors, officers and employees, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as defined by the rules adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 406(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Code of Ethical Business Conduct covers a number of important subjects, including: conflicts of interest; corporate opportunities; fair dealing; confidentiality; protection and proper use of Company assets; compliance with laws, rules and regulations (including insider trading laws); and encouraging the reporting of illegal or unethical behavior, and was updated to reflect changes in leadership structure and to stress the Company's core values of Respect, Integrity, and Excellence.
Copies of the Company's Code of Ethical Business Conduct can be obtained free of charge from the Corporate Governance portion of the Investor Relations section of the Company's website: www.aquaamerica.com. The Company intends to post amendments to or waivers from the Code of Ethical Business Conduct (to the extent applicable to the Company's executive officers, senior financial officers or directors) on its website.
Corporate Governance
Director Share Ownership Guidelines
In December 2015, the Board of Directors approved share ownership guidelines for each director to own shares of Company common stock having a value equal to five times the annual base cash retainer for directors. Directors had up to three years from December 2015 or upon appointment, whichever is later, to attain this new guideline share ownership level. In 2017, the Board of Directors approved a modification to these guidelines prohibiting a director from selling Company common stock until the director has attained the required share ownership. Once the required share ownership level is attained, the director must maintain the level of share ownership for the duration of the director's service. As of December 31, 2018, each director nominee owned sufficient shares to comply with these guidelines, except Ms. Amato and Mr. Stewart, who have been directors since 2018, Mr. Hilferty, who has been a director since 2017, and Mr. Womack, who is standing for election for the first time.
The below chart shows the shareholdings of the director nominees as of December 31, 2018:

[END TABLE]
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy
We believe that issuance of incentive and compensatory equity awards to our directors and named executive officers along with our stock ownership guidelines help to align the interests of such officers with our shareholders. As part of our insider trading policy, we prohibit all directors and officers from engaging in hedging or pledging activities with respect to any owned shares or outstanding equity awards. None of our directors nor any of our named executive officers pledged any shares of Company stock during 2018. None of our directors nor any of our named executive officers engaged in any hedging or pledging activities with respect to the Company stock during 2018.
Environmental Stewardship
The Company has been in the business of practicing sustainability and corporate social responsibility for more than 130 years. Each year, the Company delivers more than 86 billion gallons of water, the Earth's single most essential resource, to approximately 3 million people across eight states. Our top priority is to provide our customers with water that is safe to drink and is treated through the most sustainable and environmentally friendly methods available.
The Company also focuses on rebuilding aging infrastructure in the states in which it operates. In 2018, the Company published its first Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") report and reinforced its commitment to environmental stewardship by joining the CDP, an international not-for-profit organization that runs a global disclosure system for companies to manage their environmental impacts. For 2018, the Company's CDP ranking was among the top 40 percent of U.S. companies in terms of its understanding of climate change impact on business and the positioning of senior leadership to oversee key environmental issues.
The Board of Directors receives reports at regularly scheduled meetings on safety, sustainability, and environmental stewardship matters. These programs are overseen and managed by the Company's senior leadership. A significant portion of the performance-based goals for our executives focus on these important issues.
Our corporate responsibility and sustainability programs consist of:
Corporate Governance
In addition, the Company is dedicated to creating a sustainable working atmosphere for its employees to attract and retain the best employees. Its programs include a commitment to diversity, building a culture of inclusion, supporting employee wellness and focusing on safety for our employees. In 2017, the Company was named as a winning "W" Company by 2020 Women on Boards because its board of directors was made up of 25 percent women.
The Company also devotes a significant amount of time to improving its customer experience, including customer education and customer security, and maintaining and growing its supplier diversity programs. Finally, the Company actively encourages corporate giving and volunteerism by its leadership, employees, suppliers, and vendors.
Cybersecurity Management
In 2018, the Board of Directors oversaw the Company's cybersecurity risk assessment and security measures. By receiving at least quarterly reports, the Board of Directors and the Risk Mitigation and Investment Policy Committee ensure that the Company is devoting the appropriate amount of resources to ensure that the risk of a cybersecurity breach is mitigated and that there is a clear response plan in the event of a breach.
Policies and Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions
The Board has a written policy with respect to related person transactions to document procedures pursuant to which such transactions are reviewed, approved or ratified. The policy applies to any transaction in which: (1) the Company is a participant, (2) any related person has a direct or indirect material interest, and the annual amount involved exceeds $120,000, but excludes certain types of transactions in which the related person is deemed not to have a material interest.
Under this policy, a related person means: (a) any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year was, a director, an executive officer or a director nominee; (b) any person known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities; (c) any immediate family member of a person identified in items (a) or (b) above, meaning such person's spouse, parent, stepparent, child, stepchild, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in-law, brother- or sister-in-law or any other individual (other than a tenant or employee) who shares the person's household; or (d) any entity that employs any person identified in (a), (b) or (c) or in which any person identified in (a), (b) or (c) directly or indirectly owns or otherwise has a material interest.
The Corporate Governance Committee, with assistance from the Company's General Counsel, is responsible for reviewing and approving any related person transaction. In its review and approval of related person transactions (including its determination as to whether the related person has a material interest in a transaction), the Corporate Governance Committee will consider, among other factors:
The Corporate Governance Committee intends to approve only those related person transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Board and Board Committees
During 2018, our Board of Directors consisted of Elizabeth A. Amato, Carolyn J. Burke, Nicholas DeBenedictis, Christopher
H. Franklin, William P. Hankowsky, Daniel J. Hilferty, Wendell F. Holland, Ellen T. Ruff and Lee C. Stewart. Ms. Burke and Mr. Hankowsky and Mr. Holland are not standing for re-election as a director. Mr. Hankowsky and the Corporate Governance Committee evaluated his time commitments including his service as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Liberty Property Trust and as a member of Citizens Financial Group board of directors in addition to the Company's Board. The Corporate Governance Committee was aware that Ms. Burke accepted a new position which required her service on several internal boards and her singular focus on her new position.
The Company's Bylaws provide that the Board of Directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the whole Board, may designate an Executive Committee and one or more other committees, with each such committee to consist of two or more directors except for the Audit Committee and Executive Compensation Committee, which must have at least three members. The Board of Directors annually elects from its members the Executive, Audit, Executive Compensation, Risk
Corporate Governance
Mitigation and Investment Policy, and Corporate Governance Committees. The Board may also from time to time appoint ad hoc committees such as an Executive Search Committee to oversee the Company's succession planning activities. The Retirement and Employee Benefits Committee, which is comprised of senior management of the Company, reports periodically to the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors held thirty (30) meetings in 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the Committees on which each such director served in 2018. The Board of Directors encourages all directors to attend the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. All the directors who served as such at the time of the meeting were in attendance at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Each of the standing Committees of the Board of Directors operates pursuant to a written Committee Charter. Copies of these Charters can be obtained free of charge from the Corporate Governance portion of the Investor Relations section of the Company's website: www.aquaamerica.com. The members of the standing Committees of the Board of Directors, as of the close of business on December 31, 2018, were as follows:
(1)    Ms. Burke and Messrs. Hankowsky and Holland are not standing for re-election at this Annual Meeting.
Executive Committee
Pursuant to its charter, the Executive Committee has and exercises all of the authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Company, with certain specified exceptions. The Executive Committee is intended to serve in the event that action by the Board of Directors is necessary or desirable between regular meetings of the Board, or at a time when convening a meeting of the entire Board is not practical, and to make recommendations to the entire Board with respect to various matters. The Executive Committee currently has four members, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors serves as Chairman of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee did not meet in 2018.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is presently composed of four directors, whom the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined meet the standards of independence required of audit committee members by the NYSE listing requirements and applicable SEC rules. Based on a review of the background and experience of the members of the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors determined that, currently, all members of the Committee are financially literate and three members of the Committee are financial experts within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. The Committee operates pursuant to a Board-approved charter which states its duties and responsibilities. The primary responsibilities of the Committee are to monitor the integrity of the Company's financial reporting process and systems of internal controls, including the review of the Company's annual audited financial statements, and to monitor the independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee is required to meet at least four times during the year and met 9 times during 2018.
The Audit Committee has the exclusive authority to select, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee has considered the extent and scope of non-audit services provided to the Company by its independent registered public accounting firm and has determined that such services are compatible with the independent registered public accounting firm maintaining its independence.
Executive Compensation Committee
The Executive Compensation Committee is composed of four directors, whom the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined are independent directors as defined by the NYSE listing requirements and applicable SEC rules. The Committee operates pursuant to a Board-approved charter which states its duties and responsibilities. The Executive Compensation Committee has the power to, among other things, administer and make awards under the Company's equity compensation plans.
Corporate Governance
The Executive Compensation Committee reviews the recommendations of the Company's Chief Executive Officer as to appropriate compensation of the Company's executive officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) and determines the compensation of such executive officers. The Executive Compensation Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors the compensation for the Company's Chief Executive Officer, which is subject to final approval by the independent members of the Board of Directors. The Executive Compensation Committee has the power to delegate aspects of its work to subcommittees, with the approval of the Board of Directors. The Executive Compensation Committee met 8 times during 2018.
Corporate Governance Committee
The Corporate Governance Committee is composed of four directors, whom the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined are independent directors as defined by the NYSE listing requirements. The Committee operates pursuant to a Board-approved charter which states its duties and responsibilities, which include identifying and considering qualified nominees for directors, and developing and periodically reviewing the Corporate Governance Guidelines by which the Board of Directors is organized and executes its responsibilities. The Committee advises the Board of Directors on director nominees, executive selections and succession, including ensuring that there is a succession plan for the Chief Executive Officer and such other senior executives as determined by the Committee. In 2017, the Committee initiated and oversaw the implementation of a comprehensive Board, Committee, and peer review process. It also reviews and approves, ratifies or rejects related person transactions under the Company's written policy with respect to related person transactions. The Corporate Governance Committee met 8 times during 2018.
Risk Mitigation and Investment Policy Committee
The Risk Mitigation and Investment Policy Committee is composed of four directors and the Company's Chief Financial Officer. The Committee operates pursuant to a Board approved charter, which states its duties and responsibilities. The Committee oversees the Company's risk management process, policies, and procedures for identifying, managing and monitoring critical risks, including cyber-related risks, and its compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Committee also oversees the Company's acquisition process in which it reviews all acquisitions valued in excess of $10 million. The Committee communicates with other Committees to avoid overlap and potential gaps in overseeing the Company's risks. The Committee advises the Board of Directors in its performance of its oversight of enterprise risk management. The Risk Mitigation and Investment Policy Committee met 6 times during 2018.
Director Compensation
In 2018, the Executive Compensation Committee retained Pay Governance, LLC ("Pay Governance") to review and benchmark the Board of Directors' compensation. Pay Governance compared the directors' compensation to the Company's peers and made certain suggestions and recommendations to the Executive Compensation Committee and to the Company's Corporate Governance Committee. As a result, in December 2018, upon the recommendation of its Executive Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors approved the following revised directors' compensation program effective January 1, 2019:
All directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with attendance at Board or Committee meetings. The following table sets forth the compensation paid to the Board of Directors in 2018:

 PROPOSAL          2 Ratification of the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as          the  Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Company for the 2019 Fiscal Year 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the 2019 fiscal year. PwC has been the Company's independent registered public accountants since 2000. The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders ratify the appointment.
Although shareholder ratification of the engagement of PwC is not required by law or the Company's Bylaws, the Board of Directors believes that it is desirable to give our shareholders the opportunity to ratify the appointment. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee will take this into consideration and may or may not consider the appointment of another independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for future years. Even if the appointment of PwC is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm during the year if the Audit Committee determines such a change would be in the best interests of the Company. Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement at the meeting if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
PwC has informed us that they are not aware of any independence-related relationships between their firm and the Company other than the professional services discussed in "Services and Fees" below. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley"), the Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. As a result, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm in order to assure that such services do not impair the auditor's independence from the Company. The Audit Committee has established a procedure to pre-approve all auditing and non-auditing fees proposed to be provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm prior to engaging the accountants for that purpose. Consideration and approval of such services occurs at the Audit Committee's regularly scheduled meetings, or by unanimous consent of all the Audit Committee members between meetings. All fees and services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee for the 2018 fiscal year.
Services and Fees
The following table presents the fees paid to PwC for professional services rendered with respect to the 2018 fiscal year and 2017 fiscal year:
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee oversees the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal control. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 including: the quality of the accounting principles, practices and judgments; the reasonableness of significant judgments; the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements; and the integrity of the Company's financial reporting processes and controls. The Committee also discussed the selection and evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the review of all relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and the Company.
The Audit Committee reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, their judgments as to the quality of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as required to be discussed by the Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm, the firm's independence from management and the Company, including the matters in the written disclosures required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the accountants' independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets with the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, the inclusion of the Company's audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
Respectfully submitted,
William P. Hankowsky, Chairman  Carolyn J. Burke

The foregoing Report of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.
Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, shareholders are entitled to an advisory (non-binding) vote on the executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement for our named executive officers (sometimes referred to as "Say on Pay"). Currently, this vote is conducted every year. Accordingly, the following resolution is being presented by the Board of Directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers for 2018, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
This vote is non-binding. The Board of Directors and the Executive Compensation Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, expect to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions to the extent they can determine the cause or causes of any significant negative voting results.
As described in detail under our Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 23 through 51 of this Proxy Statement, our executive compensation program is designed to motivate our executives to achieve our primary goals of providing our customers with quality, cost-effective and reliable water and wastewater services and providing our shareholders with a long-term, positive return on their investment. We believe that our executive compensation program, with its balance of short-term incentives and long-term incentives and share ownership guidelines, reward sustained performance that is aligned with the interests of our customers, employees and long-term shareholders. Shareholders are encouraged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Introduction
In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), we address our compensation philosophy and program, and compensation paid to or earned by the following executive officers:
We refer to these executive officers as our "named executive officers" or "NEOs". As used in this CD&A, the total of base salary and annual cash incentive compensation is referred to as "total cash compensation," and the total of base salary, annual cash incentive compensation and equity incentive compensation is referred to as "total direct compensation." The purpose of the CD&A is to explain: the elements of compensation; why our Executive Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") selects these elements; and how the Compensation Committee determines the relative size of each element of compensation.
Compensation decisions for Messrs. Smeltzer, Schuller, Fox, Rhodes, and Luning were made by the Compensation Committee. Compensation decisions for Mr. Franklin were made by the independent members of our Board of Directors based on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee.
Based on input from Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance" or the "consultant"), the independent compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee, we believe that the types of compensation vehicles we use and the relative proportion of the named executive officers' total direct compensation represented by these vehicles is consistent with current competitive compensation practices in our industry. We believe our program's performance measures align the interests of our stakeholders and our named executive officers by correlating pay to our short-term and long-term performance.
We measure the competitiveness of our program for our named executive officers against the median compensation for comparable positions at other companies in our benchmark group composed of other investor owned utilities. Since compensation levels often vary based on the Company's revenues, we adjust the Company's revenues in the manner described below to align with the companies in the benchmark group. We then size adjust the market data using revenue-based regression analysis to determine the market medians for our named executive officer positions. Our goal is to provide total direct compensation that is competitive with the market median for each named executive officer. Based on the information supplied by the consultant, the total target direct compensation for each of our named executive officers was within the competitive range of the benchmark market data for each of their positions during 2018.
Executive Summary
Our 2018 performance demonstrates continued execution of our strategic goals and plans. During 2018, by effectively managing costs, strategically growing when it was prudent, maintaining strong regulatory relationships, and focusing on our customers, employees, and shareholders as we continue to create value for all of our stakeholders, we had the following results:
Executive Compensation
* See Appendix B for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.
Objectives of our Compensation Program
Our compensation program for named executive officers is designed to:
Align Interests of Named Executive Officers and Shareholders
We supplement our pay-for-performance program with a number of compensation policies intended to align the interests of management and our shareholders. Input received from our shareholders during our 2018 shareholder engagement is reflected in our pay-for-performance compensation program.
The following are several key features of our executive compensation program:
Executive Compensation
With respect to the named executive officer's total direct compensation, at least 75% of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation is performance and/or stock-based.
* Reflects an average.
Pay for Performance and Results of the 2018 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation
Our goal is to instill a "pay for performance" culture throughout the Company.
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, we submitted a proposal to our shareholders for a non-binding advisory vote on our 2017 compensation awarded to our named executive officers. Our shareholders approved the proposal with over 94% of the votes cast in favor of the Company's compensation program for our named executive officers.
Components of 2018 Compensation Program
Our executive compensation program is composed of the following seven elements, which we believe are important components of a well-designed, balanced and competitive compensation program:
Executive Compensation
We utilize these elements to achieve the objectives of our compensation program as follows:

Components of Compensation Paid to Named Executive Officers in 2018
Executive Compensation
Benchmarking Competitive Compensation and the Role of the Compensation Committee's Consultant
The Compensation Committee has retained Pay Governance, a nationally-recognized compensation consulting firm, as the Compensation Committee's consultant to assist it in designing and assessing the competitiveness of our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee has concluded that Pay Governance is an independent consultant after considering the factors relevant to Pay Governance's independence from management, including the factors set forth in the NYSE and SEC rules regarding compensation consultant independence.
Annually, the Compensation Committee has the consultant develop a market rate for base salary, total cash compensation, and total direct compensation for each of the named executive officer positions, including the allocation between cash compensation and equity incentives. Each market rate represents the median compensation level that would be paid to a hypothetical, seasoned performer in a position having similar responsibilities and scope, in an organization of similar size and type as the Company.
In developing the market median for the named executive officers, the Compensation Committee's consultant, Pay Governance, used compensation data from all 59 investor-owned utilities in the utility industry database used by the consultant and approved by the Compensation Committee to determine the market median for similarly situated executives of utility companies. The Compensation Committee believes that utilizing the data from only utility companies and adjusting the Company's revenues as described below, to better align the Company's data with the data in the utility industry compensation database, provides an appropriate comparison for determining the market rates for the Company's named executive officers given that we are primarily a utility company. Also, due to the relatively limited number of investor-owned water utility companies of the Company's size, the Compensation Committee believes that using the broader utility market data provides reasonable and reliable data for determining competitive compensation levels. All 59 companies in the utility industry compensation database used by the consultant are listed in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. The Company has no involvement in the selection of the companies that are included in the database used by the consultant. Each company in Appendix A was used in the development of the market median, as described in this paragraph.
Management, the Compensation Committee, and Pay Governance are mindful that compensation levels for executives of companies are often correlated with a company's size as defined by revenues. In other words, executives in companies with higher revenues are generally paid more than executives with comparable positions in companies with lower revenues. The Compensation Committee and Pay Governance have concluded that the Company's revenues under-represent the complexity and scope of the Company's business given the Company's low cost of goods sold relative to energy-based utilities. The cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues is significant for energy-based utilities due to their fuel, gas and other power costs. These commodity costs are subsequently recovered through the revenues of the energy-based utilities as they are ultimately passed through to the customer. The Company, like other water utilities, does not have comparable commodity costs. The purpose of the adjusted revenue analysis is to create a consistent comparison to the compensation data in the utility compensation database used by Pay Governance by estimating the revenue that the Company would earn if its cost of goods sold was in similar proportion to that of the energy-based utilities that constitute the majority of the companies in the database. In order to determine a factor by which to adjust the Company's annual revenues, the Compensation Committee recommended that the consultant analyze the income statements of a sample of delivery-focused (i.e., non-power generating) utilities, chosen by the consultant with no input from the Compensation Committee or management, to develop a typical cost of goods sold factor attributable to commodity costs.
Pay Governance's analysis for 2018 determined that the commodity portion of the cost of goods sold averaged 40% of revenues for these companies and calculated what the Company's adjusted revenues would be using this factor. Since there are certain complexities associated with procuring these commodities at the energy-based utilities, the consultant recommended, and the Compensation Committee agreed, that it would be appropriate to discount the market median rate generated by the adjusted revenue methodology. Thus, it was agreed that the Company would use an average of the market data produced using the Company's adjusted revenue scope with market data generated using the Company's actual revenue scope in determining the market rates for the Company's named executive officers.
Because the companies listed in Appendix A vary widely in terms of revenues, Pay Governance used regression analysis to size-adjust the benchmark data for each named executive officer's revenue responsibility using the Company's actual and adjusted revenues, where possible, and then averaging the results to determine market medians for base salary, total cash compensation and total direct compensation for each named executive officer. Tabular data was used where regression data was unavailable due to insufficient correlation between officer positions in the Company and the companies in the database and/or limited sample size to ensure the accuracy of the regression analysis. Regression analysis is an objective calculation that identifies a relationship between one variable (in this case, compensation) and another variable that is correlated to it (in this case, total company revenues). Therefore, in developing the market medians for base salary, total cash compensation, and total direct compensation, Pay Governance used regression analysis to determine what the companies in Appendix A would pay at the median for positions comparable to those of the Company's named executive officers. The combination of salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives is intended to compensate executives at approximately the 50th percentile of the market when the Company performs at a target level.
Executive Compensation
Pay Governance reviews the Company's executive compensation program for the Compensation Committee and annually provides the data and analysis described above. The compensation consultant discusses the proposed actual compensation awards for the named executive officers and provides research and input to the Compensation Committee on changes to the compensation program.
In 2018, Pay Governance also analyzed the Company's executive compensation program to ensure that it remained competitive in the market median to show the market rate for base salary, total cash compensation and total direct compensation, including the allocation between cash compensation and equity incentives. Pay Governance provides no other services to the Company other than serving as the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant for executive and director compensation decisions.
Other Considerations
The Compensation Committee also takes into consideration the results of the advisory votes on the Company's executive compensation program for the few years prior to the year for which the executive compensation decisions are being made. For the years 2014 through 2018, the shareholders approved the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers by 93% to 94% of the votes cast.
Determination of Actual Compensation
We emphasize pay for performance, especially for our higher-level executives. Therefore, the named executive officers tend to receive a substantial portion of their total direct compensation from annual cash incentives and long-term equity incentives. In addition, the percentages of total direct compensation represented by base salary, annual cash incentive opportunities, and equity incentives, respectively, for the named executive officers are generally in line with the percentages represented by these elements of total direct compensation for the competitive market median benchmarks.
The Compensation Committee determines the actual amount of each element of annual compensation to award to the Company's named executive officers with the goal of having the target total direct compensation opportunity for each named executive officer generally within a range of 15% above or below the market median rate for his position over time.
Base Salary
A competitive base salary is necessary to attract and retain a talented and experienced workforce. Actual salaries for the named executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer whose salary is determined by the Board of Directors using the same criteria, are determined by the Compensation Committee by considering both the market median rate for the position and internal equity with both the other named executive officers and other employees of the Company. The Compensation Committee's goal is to maintain base salaries generally in line with the market median rate over time for each of the named executive officers, although deviations from this goal may occur due to promotions, and the time the executive has been in a particular salary grade. Base salaries are considered for adjustment annually and adjustments are based on general movement in external salary levels, changes in the market rate for the named executive officers' positions, individual performance, internal equity and changes in individual duties and responsibilities. For 2018, the annual increases to the salaries for the named executive officers reflected these assessments and averaged 6.9%. The base salaries approved by the Compensation Committee for 2018, effective April 1, 2018, were as follows: Mr. Franklin, $760,055; Mr. Smeltzer, $418,411, Mr. Fox, $378,104; Mr. Schuller, $419,928; and Mr. Luning, $343,287. The Compensation Committee approved a base salary for Mr. Rhodes of $390,000.
Short-Term Incentive Awards
The 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Awards
Annual cash incentive awards under the Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Annual Plan") are intended to motivate management to focus on the achievement of annual corporate and individual objectives that would, among other things, improve the level of service to our customers, control the cost of service, and enhance our financial performance.
During 2018, the Compensation Committee, Pay Governance, and management determined that it was appropriate to design the annual cash incentive portion of the total direct compensation paid to the named executive officers to place more emphasis on financial, safety, and compliance performance metrics and to reduce the weight allocated to individual goals. The Compensation Committee believes that these changes will focus the named executive officers' efforts on business metrics that are core to the Company's mission and reward the named executive officers' performance in achieving these metrics.
Executive Compensation
The Annual Plan aligns the Company's goals with payouts dependent upon achievement of certain performance objectives over a one year period. The tables and the narrative below detail the 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Award Metrics.
1 The Target ROE is based upon the Company's consolidated allowed ROE, excluding the Company's Texas operations.
Financial – 50%
The financial metric was based on the Company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS)* and on the Company's return on equity (ROE).
* Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Appendix B for reconciliation to the GAAP financial measure and adjustments made for purposes of the compensation metric attainment.
Safety – 15%
The safety metric was comprised of three equally weighted specific safety components including Lost Time Incidents, Responsible Vehicle Accident Rate, and Recordable Incidents. The performance range was 50% to 150% of the target.
Compliance – 15%
The compliance metric had two components – drinking water compliance rate and waste water compliance rate. The performance range was 50% to 150% of the target.
Customer Satisfaction – 10%
In 2018, the Company decided to incent management to focus on customer satisfaction through the use of measuring the "service level" with which it provides to its customers. The performance range was 50% to 150% of the target.
Individual Goals – 10%
At the beginning of 2018, two individual goals were identified for each named executive officer that aligned with the broader Company goals. Similarly, when Mr. Rhodes joined the Company, two individual goals were identified for him. Individual goals focus on the named executive officer's role with the Company. Each named executive officer was rated on the achievement of each goal and received a rating between 50%-150%.
Executive Compensation
2018 Performance
Based on the above-described factors, the following table shows the 2018 performance of the Company compared to the targets set in the Annual Plan:
The Compensation Committee evaluated the actual attainment of each performance goal, with particular emphasis on the above-target achievement of all goals, and determined that the aggregate achievement of the corporate goals was 126.34%. Based on this determination, the below table shows the target annual cash incentive awards and the actual annual cash incentive awards, based on both corporate and individual goals, approved by the Compensation Committee for 2018 for the named executive officers. The "2018 Salary Rate" is an annualized rate.
*Mr. Smeltzer retired in 2018.
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards
Our use of equity incentive awards are intended to reward our named executive officers for: (1) enhancing the Company's financial health, which also benefits our customers; (2) improving our long-term performance through both revenue increases and cost control; and (3) achieving increases in the Company's equity and shareholder value, as well as helping to retain such executives due to the longer-term nature of these awards. We make these equity incentive awards under our 2009 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, as amended (the "Plan"). Under the Plan, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors may grant stock options, dividend equivalents, performance-based or service-based stock units and stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, key employees and key consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries who are in a position to contribute materially to the successful operation of our business.
As part of its review of the total compensation package for our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee annually reviews our equity incentive compensation program. Starting in 2011, the Compensation Committee began using a combination of performance share units and restricted stock units to better link the named executive officer's long-term incentive compensation to performance results that led to increased shareholder value and enhanced our long-term financial stability, which also benefits our customers. In 2017, the Compensation Committee added performance-based stock options to the long-term incentive compensation program for the same reasons.
Executive Compensation
We aim to strike a balance between the incentive and retention goals of our equity grants:
Using the market median rates developed by Pay Governance, the Compensation Committee bases the annual equity incentive awards made to the named executive officers as part of the total compensation package designed to be competitive with the benchmarked group and our industry. The Compensation Committee does not consider any increase or decrease in the value of past equity incentive awards in making these annual decisions. In considering the number of equity incentive awards to be granted in total to all employees each year, the Compensation Committee considers the number of equity incentive awards outstanding and the number of equity incentive awards to be awarded as a percentage of Aqua America's total shares outstanding. The number of equity incentive awards granted annually to all employees has been less than 1% of Aqua America's total shares outstanding per year for the past several years. It is our equity granting policy to make all equity incentive awards on the same grant date.
Long Term Equity Incentive Awards Balance
Each year, the Compensation Committee seeks to strike the right balance between performance-based equity awards and restricted share units. Performance-based equity awards provide guidance and incentives to management for building shareholder growth, while restricted share units provide retention benefits while closely aligning management with the shareholders. The Compensation Committee is also focused on tying the awards to the appropriate metric. Below are charts describing the balance between the performance share units metrics, performance-based options, and restricted share units:
Executive Compensation
Vested Performance Share Awards and Status of Outstanding Performance Share Awards
Performance share or performance share unit grants ("PSU") (together referred to as performance shares) provide the named executive officer with the opportunity to earn awards of shares based on Company performance against designated pre-determined, objective metrics. Participants are granted a target number of shares or units that can increase to 200% of the target or decrease to zero based on the Company's actual performance compared to the designated metrics. Dividends or dividend equivalents, as applicable, on the performance shares accrue and will be paid when the performance shares are earned and paid based on the number of shares actually earned, if any.
The performance goals to be achieved under the PSU awards have been based on the following performance goals, with the weighting of each goal assessed each year:
2016-2018 PSU Awards Achievement
The three-year performance period for the PSU awards made by the Compensation Committee in 2016 ended on December 31, 2018. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined the achievement of performance goals for the 2016 PSUs.
As a result, the Compensation Committee certified that a 70.68% payout of the 2016 PSU awards was earned in accordance with the following results and weightings:
Applying this performance, the below table shows the Target PSU award and the Actual PSU award approved by the Compensation Committee for the NEOs.*
As is seen by the above charts, the Compensation Committee believes that its long-term incentive compensation program aligns with the shareholders, combining total shareholder return with objective metrics aimed at increasing shareholder value, with the actual payout based on actual achievement of four metrics that the Compensation Committee believes address share-based and operational metrics that are important to shareholders. It is anticipated that, following the consummation of the Peoples Gas acquisition and completion of a transition period, when appropriate metrics can be established, the executive compensation program will return to a structure similar to the foregoing awards, as adapted for the combined businesses.
Executive Compensation
Outstanding 2017-2019 PSU Awards
The PSU awards granted in 2017 have similar performance goals to the 2016 PSU awards, with different percentile rankings and scales, and a performance period that began on January 1, 2017 and will end on December 31, 2019. Please see the disclosure under the heading "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" for a description of the status of such 2017 PSU awards.
Outstanding 2018-2020 PSU Awards
The 2018 PSU awards have similar performance goals to the 2016 and 2017 PSU awards, and a performance period that began on January 1, 2018 and will end on December 31, 2020. Please see the disclosure under the heading "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" for a description of the status of such 2018 PSU awards.
Stock Options
In 2017, the Compensation Committee added performance-based stock options to the grants to the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee believes that the award of stock options, when paired with the performance and service-based stock awards, aligns the interests of the named executive officers with those of the shareholders as the value of the stock option is a function of the price of the Company's stock. In addition, stock options provide the use of an additional performance metric for the earning of long-term equity compensation.
The named executive officer's outstanding performance-based stock options will vest ratably over a three-year period based upon the Company's achievement of at least an adjusted return on equity equal to 150 basis points below the return on equity granted by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (the "PUC") during Aqua Pennsylvania's, the Company's Pennsylvania subsidiary, last rate proceeding. The Company's adjusted return on equity is calculated annually in accordance with the below descriptive formula and if the adjusted return on equity meets or exceeds 150 basis points below the return of equity of the most current Pennsylvania PUC rate award, the awards will vest:
Return on Equity = net income (excluding net income or loss from acquisitions which have not yet been incorporated into a rate application as of the last year end) / equity (excluding equity applicable to acquisitions which are not yet incorporated in a rate application during the award period), all as adjusted in accordance with the Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan.
Restricted Share Awards
Annual restricted share or restricted stock unit grants (together referred to as "restricted shares") entitle the named executive officer to receive the number of shares granted at the end of a given period of time, or in increments over a period of years on the anniversaries of the grant date, provided the named executive officer remains an employee of the Company, unless separation is due to death, disability, retirement or termination following a Change in Control, in which cases acceleration of the lapse of forfeiture restrictions occurs as set forth in the Plan. Dividends or dividend equivalents, as applicable, are accumulated and paid when the restricted shares are paid. The restricted shares to the other named executive officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) vest 100% after three years, with vesting subject solely to continued service with the Company.
The restricted shares to the Chief Executive Officer vest 100% after three years, with vesting subject to continued service with the Company and the Company's achievement of at least an adjusted return on equity equal to 150 basis points below return on equity granted by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission during the Company's Pennsylvania subsidiary's last rate proceeding, subjected to adjustments as allowed pursuant to the Plan. The return on equity shall be calculated in the same manner as it is calculated for the purposes of determining the return on equity required for the vesting of stock options.
Impact of the Peoples Gas Transaction
The acquisition of Peoples Gas is projected to close in mid-2019. Because of this projected closing date, the Compensation Committee reviewed several different alternatives for addressing the uncertainty associated with the acquisition. Among other items, the Compensation Committee considered various performance metrics with a goal of aligning management's interests with the Company's shareholders. In the end, the Compensation Committee determined that keeping management engaged and aligned with the Company's shareholders was paramount and that granting performance-based stock options, with performance based on stock price, and continuing to award service-based restricted stock units would be the best way to align the interests.
Accordingly, the Compensation Committee determined that the 2019 executive long-term compensation plan will consist of 70% performance-based stock options with the ROE goal described above, with a three year pro-rata vesting cycle and 30% service-based restricted stock units with a three year cliff vesting cycle. The Compensation Committee believes this LTI program will most closely align the interests of management with the shareholders for this transition year. For management to be rewarded, the Company's share price must increase, aligning management's interests with the Company's shareholders. Similarly, the grant of restricted stock units, when coupled with our stock ownership requirements, further aligns management with the shareholders by increasing the amount of shares each member of management holds.
Executive Compensation
Retirement Plans
Our retirement plans are intended to provide competitive retirement benefits to help attract and retain employees. Some of our named executive officers are participants in our qualified pension plan (benefits frozen as of December 31, 2014) (the "Retirement Plan"), and in our non-qualified pension benefit plan (the "Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan"). Our non-qualified retirement plan is intended to provide executive officers with a retirement benefit that is comparable on a percentage of salary basis to that of our other employees participating in the Retirement Plan by providing the benefits that are limited under current Internal Revenue Service regulations. Benefits continue to accrue for some of our named executive officers in the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan. Starting in 2009, the Company began to fund the trust for the benefits under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan using trust-owned life insurance. A named executive officer's retirement benefits under our qualified and non-qualified retirement plan are not taken into account in determining the executive's current compensation. Effective December 31, 2014, the named executive officers ceased accruing a benefit under the Retirement Plan. Specifically, their plan compensation and credited service for purposes of determining their benefits was frozen in the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2014. Vesting service will continue to accrue in the Retirement Plan as long as the named executive officer remains employed by the Company.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan
We maintain a non-qualified Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Executive Deferral Plan") that allows eligible members of management to defer all or a portion of their salary and annual cash incentives, which enables participants to save for retirement and other life events in a tax-effective manner. Deferred amounts are deemed invested in one or more mutual funds selected by the participant under trust-owned life insurance policies on the lives of eligible executives. In addition, in order to provide named executive officers with the full Company matching contribution available to other employees under our qualified plans, executives who choose to defer up to six percent of their salary under one of Aqua America's 401(k) plans, but do not receive the full Company matching contribution under such qualified plans due to the Internal Revenue Service regulations limiting the total dollar amount that can be deferred under a 401(k) plan ($18,000 for 2016, and $18,500 for 2017 and 2018), receive the portion of the Company matching contribution that would otherwise be forfeited by the executive as an Aqua America contribution into the Executive Deferral Plan. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company began to fund the trust holding amounts deferred by the participants in the Executive Deferral Plan using trust-owned life insurance. A named executive officer's deferrals and any earnings on deferrals under our non-qualified deferred compensation plan are not taken into account in determining the named executive officer's compensation.
Severance Plans
All of the named executive officers are covered by a severance policy. The policy provides the named executive officers with a severance benefit of one full year salary and one full year projected bonus and a minimum of one month of continued medical benefits and a maximum of six months of continued medical benefits following termination, provided that the named executive officer is terminated for any reason other than for cause.
Additionally, Mr. Franklin and the Company have entered into an Employment Agreement ("Mr. Franklin's Employment Agreement"). Pursuant to Mr. Franklin's Employment Agreement, if the Company terminates Mr. Franklin's employment without cause or does not renew the term of the Employment Agreement, or Mr. Franklin terminates his employment for good reason (as defined in the agreement), Mr. Franklin will receive any accrued but unpaid salary and accrued vacation as well as a lump sum equal to (i) 24 months of base salary and (ii) two times the target annual bonus. If the Company terminates Mr. Franklin's employment for cause or if he terminates his employment without good reason, or for death or disability, Mr. Franklin (or his estate) will receive any accrued but unpaid salary and accrued vacation. Mr. Franklin's Employment Agreement expires July 1, 2021, and may be extended for successive one-year terms upon mutual agreement of the Company and Mr. Franklin. Mr. Franklin's Employment Agreement is filed with our SEC filings.
Change-In-Control Agreements
We maintain change-in-control agreements with the named executive officers. These change-in-control agreements are intended to minimize the distraction and uncertainty that could affect key management in the event we become involved in a transaction that could result in a change in control of Aqua America, enable the executives to impartially evaluate such a transaction, provide a retention incentive to our named executive officers and encourage their attention and dedication to their duties and responsibilities in the event of a possible change-in-control. Under the terms of these agreements, the covered named executive officer is entitled to certain severance payments and a payment in lieu of the continuation of benefits if he experiences a termination of employment other than for cause, or in the event the executive resigns for good reason, as defined in the agreements, within two years following a change-in-control of Aqua America. (See the description of "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control" on pages 49 through 51.)
Executive Compensation
These change-in-control agreements are referred to as "double trigger" agreements because they only provide a benefit to executives whose employment is terminated, or who have good reason to resign, following a change-in-control. These change-in-control agreements do not provide any payments or benefits to the covered executives merely as a result of a change-in-control. The normal annual restricted share, stock option and performance share grants to the named executive officers also contain double trigger provisions. Each of the change-in-control agreements limits the amount of the payments under the agreements to the Internal Revenue Service's limitation on the deductibility of these payments under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code").
The Company has determined that there will be no tax gross-ups in any change-in-control agreements with executives and that all such agreements will be subject to the limitations under Section 280G of the Code. We believe that the multiples of compensation and other benefits provided under the change-in-control agreements, as described on pages 49 through 51, are consistent with the multiples in the market. Named executive officers who receive payments under their change-in- control agreements in connection with their separation from employment following a change-in-control will not be entitled to any payments under our normal severance policy.
Perquisites
We offer a limited number of perquisites for our named executive officers. The Board has authorized executive benefits consisting of executive financial planning and annual executive physical exams. The Board regularly reviews the benefits provided to our executives and makes appropriate modifications based on the value of these benefits.
The Role of Management in the Executive Compensation Process
Our Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer assists the Compensation Committee by preparing schedules showing the present compensation of executives and compiling the recommended salary grade midpoints, market median rates, target annual cash incentives and target range of equity compensation awards from the information provided by the Compensation Committee's consultant. Our Chief Executive Officer compiles and presents the supporting information for the individual executives' performance against their objectives and his recommendations for any discretionary points for the evaluation of the extent of achievement of individual goals (the "Individual Factor") under the Annual Plan. He also provides the Compensation Committee with his recommendations for annual salary increases, any changes in target annual cash incentive percentages and equity incentive awards for the other executive officers. Our Chief Financial Officer provides the Compensation Committee with certifications as to our financial performance for purposes of the Compensation Committee's determination of the achievement of the Company-specific goals (the "Company Factor") for the Annual Plan, our performance against the criteria established by the Compensation Committee for the vesting of restricted share grants and the earning of performance shares. These financial measures are also certified by our Director of Internal Audit. Our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation awards for the named executive officers other than himself, but the ultimate decisions regarding compensation for these officers are made by the Compensation Committee.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
In 2005, the Board of Directors established stock ownership guidelines for the named executive officers to encourage these executives to maintain a significant ownership interest in the Company and to help align the interests of these executive officers with the long-term performance of the Company. In 2017, these guidelines were modified to recognize the different levels of executives who may be among the named executive officers and to state the guidelines in terms of the number of shares to be held rather than a dollar value, in order to avoid fluctuations in the number of shares to be held based on variations in the Company's stock price. In establishing the number of shares to be held, the Compensation Committee uses a round number of shares, the value of which approximates the following multiples of the midpoint of the average base salary grade for the executives:
Each named executive officer is expected to have shareholdings consistent with these guidelines within five years after becoming a named executive officer or after receiving a significant promotion. Messrs. Franklin and Fox each received a significant promotion in 2015 and Mr. Schuller was initially hired in 2015 and Mr. Rhodes was initially hired in 2018, starting a new five-year period for each.
Executive Compensation
Shareholdings, as defined for ownership requirement purposes, include shares held directly or beneficially, including shares acquired under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan or 401(k) plans and restricted shares units and performance share units. An executive who has not achieved the guideline within this five-year period is expected to retain one-half of any equity awards, after any required tax withholding, in Company stock and to use 10% of any annual cash incentive awards after tax to purchase shares of Company stock until the guideline is met. The below chart shows the shareholdings of the named executive officers as of December 31, 2018:
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy
It is the Company's policy not to permit hedging or pledging or short-selling of the Company's stock by its named executive officers. None of our named executive officers pledged any shares of Company stock during 2018. None of our named executive officers engaged in any hedging activities with respect to the Company stock during 2018.
Clawback of Incentive Compensation
In the event of a significant restatement of our financial results caused by executive fraud or willful misconduct, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to review the cash incentive compensation received by the named executive officers with respect to the period to which the restatement relates, recalculate Aqua America's results for the period to which the restatement relates and seek reimbursement of that portion of the cash incentive compensation that was based on the misstated financial results from the executive or executives whose fraud or willful misconduct was the cause of the restatement. In addition, starting with the performance share unit grants and restricted stock unit grants in 2014, all shares issued pursuant to those grants are subject to any applicable recoupment or clawback policies and other policies implemented by the Board, as in effect from time to time.
Report of the Executive Compensation Committee
The purpose of the Compensation Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its general oversight of the Company's compensation programs and the compensation of the Company's executives. The Compensation Committee Charter describes in greater detail the full responsibilities of the committee and is available on our website: www.aquaamerica.com. The Executive Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 23 through 51 with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Executive Compensation Committee recommended to the Company's Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, the inclusion of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Respectfully submitted,
Ellen T. Ruff, Chair  Elizabeth B. Amato  Daniel J. Hilferty
The foregoing Report of the Executive Compensation Committee shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this information by reference, and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.

Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The following table sets forth information regarding equity and non-equity awards granted to the named executive officers in 2018:
Equity awards in 2018 consisted of RSUs, PSUs, and Stock Options. The RSU grants to the named executive officers vest at the end of three years from the grant date. The PSU grants to the named executive officers vest at the end of three years from the grant date, but the amount of the payout can range from 0% to 200% of the target grant depending on the Company's performance against the performance goals described on pages 30 to 33. The threshold level of PSUs that a grantee can earn is 75% of the target grant and the maximum level a grantee can earn is 200% of the target grant. The threshold, target and maximum payout for each of the named executive officers is shown in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table above. Stock Options grants to the named executive officers vest 33 ⅓% in 2019, 33 ⅓% in 2020, and 33 ⅓% in 2021.
If the Company does not achieve the required financial performance to meet the designated performance criteria, the performance shares and stock options that are subject to such performance criteria that would otherwise vest are forfeited.
Executive Compensation
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
The following table sets forth information on outstanding stock option and stock awards held by the named executive officers at December 31, 2018.
The value of the PSU awards includes accrued and unpaid dividend equivalents. The dividend equivalents were accrued based upon the assumption that the PSUs would be issued at target award.
Executive Compensation
Options Exercised and Stock Vested
The following table sets forth (1) the number of shares of stock options, restricted shares, PSUs or RSUs previously granted to the named executive officers that were exercised, vested or were earned during 2018, and (2) the value realized by those officers upon the exercise, vesting, or payment of such shares based on the closing market price for our shares of Common Stock on the exercise or vesting date.
Executive Compensation
CEO to Median Employee Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Franklin:
For 2018, as is permitted under the rules of the SEC, to determine our median employee, we chose "base salary" as our consistently-applied compensation measure and utilized the same median employee as in 2017. We annualized this measure of compensation for those who commenced employment during 2018. Using a determination date of December 31, 2018, we calculated the median base salary for all required employees. The annual total compensation of the employee identified as the median employee of the Company (other than Mr. Franklin), was $75,791 and, the annual total compensation of Mr. Franklin was $3,552,902. The annual total compensation for the median employee and Mr. Franklin were calculated under Item 402(c) of Regulation S-K.
Accordingly, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Franklin to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company was estimated to be 47 to 1.
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.
Retirement Plans and Other Post-Employment Benefits
Pension Benefits
The following table sets forth: (1) the number of years of credited service for the named executive officers under our various retirement plans as of December 31, 2018; (2) the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits under those plans as of December 31, 2018; and, (3) any payments made to the named executive officers during 2018 under those plans.
Executive Compensation
Retirement Income Plan for Aqua America, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the "Retirement Plan")
The Company sponsors a qualified defined benefit Retirement Plan to provide retirement income to the company's employees hired prior to certain dates starting in 2003. Effective December 31, 2014, the named executive officers (other than Mr. Schuller, and Mr. Rhodes who are not participants in the plan) ceased accruing a benefit under the Retirement Plan. Specifically, their plan compensation and credited service for purposes of determining their benefits were frozen in the Retirement Plan as of December 31, 2014.
For the portion of the Retirement Plan covering certain of the named executive officers, plan compensation is defined as total compensation paid, but excludes contributions made by the Company to a plan of deferred compensation, distributions from a deferred compensation plan, amounts realized from the exercise of stock options or when restricted shares underlying restricted stock units or performance shares become freely transferable, fringe benefits, welfare benefits, reimbursements or other expense allowances, moving expenses and commissions. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), imposes maximum limitations on the annual amount of pension benefits that may be paid, and the amount of compensation that may be taken into account in calculating benefits, under a qualified, funded, defined benefit pension plan such as the Retirement Plan. The Retirement Plan complies with these ERISA limitations.
Benefits earned under the final pay formula for the retirement plan are equal to 1.35% of average plan compensation plus 0.45% of average plan compensation above "Covered Compensation" for each year of credited service up to 25 years, and 0.5% of average plan compensation for each year of credited service above 25 years. The annual benefit is further subject to a minimum benefit schedule. Average plan compensation is defined as the average of plan compensation over the highest five consecutive years out of the last ten years. Covered Compensation is defined as the average of the Social Security Wage Bases (as defined in the Retirement Plan) in effect for each calendar year during the 35-year period ending with the last day of the calendar year of the benefit determination. Effective December 31, 2014, years of credited service and plan compensation in the Retirement Plan was frozen for the named executive officers (other than Mr. Schuller and Mr. Rhodes).
Under the terms of the Retirement Plan, a Company participant becomes fully vested in his or her accrued pension benefit after five years of credited service. All named executive officers (with the exception of Messrs. Rhodes and Schuller) are vested in the Retirement Plan. Participants may retire as early as age 55 with 10 years of service. Unreduced benefits are available when a participant attains the earlier of age 65 with 5 years of vesting service or age 62 with 30 years of vesting service. Otherwise, benefits are reduced 3% for each year by which retirement precedes the attainment of age 65 or are reduced actuarially in accordance with the terms of the Retirement Plan and federal law if payment occurs before age 55. Pension benefits earned are payable in the form of a lifetime annuity or can be collected as a lump sum benefit. Married individuals may receive a reduced benefit paid in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity. Mr. Fox is currently eligible to retire under the Retirement Plan. Mr. Smeltzer retired during 2018 and commenced payment of his Retirement Plan benefit.
Non-Qualified Retirement Plan
Effective December 1, 1989, the Board of Directors adopted a supplemental benefits plan for salaried employees of the Company. On December 1, 2014, the Board of Directors adopted an amended benefits plan for salaried employees of the Company (the "Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan"). The Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan is a plan that is intended to provide an additional pension benefit to Company participants in the Retirement Plan and their beneficiaries whose benefits under the Retirement Plan are adversely affected by the ERISA limitations described above. Effective December 31, 2014, the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan was amended to include credited service and plan compensation that the named executive officers would have otherwise accrued under the Retirement Plan if their benefit had not been frozen in the Retirement Plan. In addition, deferred compensation is excluded from the Retirement Plan "plan compensation" definition, but is included in the calculation of benefits under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan. The benefit under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan is equal to the difference between (i) the amount of the benefit the Company participant would have been entitled to under the Retirement Plan absent such ERISA limitations, absent the freezing of plan compensation and credited service, and including deferred compensation in the final average earnings calculation, and (ii) the amount of the benefit actually payable under the Retirement Plan.
Participants may retire as early as age 55 with 10 years of service under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan. Unreduced benefits are available when a participant attains the earlier of age 65 with 5 years of service or age 62 with 30 years of service. Otherwise, benefits are reduced 3% for each year by which retirement precedes the attainment of age 65. Pension benefits earned under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefits Plan are payable in the form of a lump sum, unless an alternative election is made. An alternative election may be made such that benefits are paid as an annuity for life (and the life of the participant's spouse upon death), in a series of installments or under certain circumstances transferred at separation from employment to up to five separate distribution accounts under the Company's Executive Deferral Plan.
Messrs. Franklin, Fox, and Luning are earning benefits under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan, and are fully vested in those benefits. Mr. Fox is currently eligible to retire under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan. Mr. Smeltzer retired during 2018 and the value of his benefit under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan will be transferred to the Company's Executive Deferral Plan. Messrs. Rhodes and Schuller do not earn any benefits under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan. In 2009, the Company began to fund the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan through the use of trust-owned life insurance.
Executive Compensation
Actuarial Assumptions used to Determine Values in the Pension Benefits Table
The amounts shown in the Pension Benefits Table above are actuarial present values of the benefits accumulated through the date shown. An actuarial present value is calculated by estimating expected future payments starting at an assumed retirement age, weighting the estimated payments by the estimated probability of surviving to each post-retirement age, and discounting the weighted payments at an assumed discount rate to reflect the time value of money. The actuarial present value represents an estimate of the amount, which, if invested today at the discount rate, would be sufficient on an average basis to provide estimated future payments based on the current accumulated benefit. Assumptions used to determine the values are the same as those disclosed on the Company's financial statements as of those dates with the exception of the assumed retirement age and the assumed probabilities of leaving employment prior to retirement. Retirement was assumed to occur at the earliest possible unreduced retirement age (or current age, if later) for each plan in which the executive participates. For purposes of determining the earliest unreduced retirement age, service was assumed to be granted until the actual date of retirement. Actual benefit present values will vary from these estimates depending on many factors, including an executive's actual retirement age. The key assumptions included in the calculations are as follows:
*Actual plan payments are shown for Mr. Smeltzer.

[END TABLE]
Employees with total projected W-2 compensation for 2018 in excess of $141,000 were eligible to participate in the Company's Executive Deferral Plan for 2018. Participants may defer up to 100% of their salary and 100% of their non-equity incentive compensation under the Company's Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Plan. At the time the participant elects to make a deferral under the Executive Deferral Plan, the participant is also required to elect the form of payment with respect to the amounts deferred for the upcoming calendar year. If a separation distribution account is elected, the participant may choose to receive his or her distribution in either a lump sum payment or, subject to certain requirements, in annual installments over 2 to 15 years. If a flexible distribution account is elected, the participant will receive his or her distribution in a lump sum payment. The executive officers, including the named executive officers, may not commence the receipt of their account balances and the earnings on these deferrals sooner than the first day of the seventh month following the date of the executive's separation from employment.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-In-Control
Change-In-Control
The Company maintains change-in-control agreements with its named executive officers. Payments under these agreements are triggered if the named executive officer's employment is terminated other than for cause or the executive resigns for good reason, as defined in the agreements, within two years after consummation of a change-in-control transaction involving the Company.
The following table provides a summary of the benefits to which each named executive officer would be entitled under the change-in-control agreements.
Executive Compensation
For purposes of the change-in-control agreements, "Base Compensation" is defined as current base annual salary, plus the greater of the named executive officer's target bonus for the year in which the executive incurs a termination of employment, or the last actual bonus paid to the named executive officer under the Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Plan (or any successor plan maintained by Aqua America), in all capacities with Aqua America and its subsidiaries or affiliates. The executive's Base Compensation would be determined prior to reduction for salary deferred by the named executive officer under any deferred compensation plan of Aqua America and its subsidiaries or affiliates, or otherwise. The named executive officer is entitled to receive a pro-rata share of the named executive officer's target annual cash incentive compensation based on the portion of the calendar year that has elapsed at the time of the named executive officer's termination. The named executive officer is also entitled to receive a lump sum payment in lieu of the continuation of certain health benefits for a period of 2 years and outplacement services.
The payment of the multiple of Base Compensation would be made in a lump sum within 60 days after the executive's termination as defined under the agreement, although pursuant to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, part or all of such payment may need to be deferred until the first day of the seventh month following the date of the named executive officer's separation from employment. Each executive is required to execute a standard release of the Company as a condition to receiving the payment under the agreement.
For equity incentive awards made under the Plan: (i) for restricted stock units without performance goals, if a change-in-control occurs prior to the vesting date, the restricted stock units would remain outstanding and vest on the vesting date or, if earlier, vest upon a qualified termination event following a change-in-control; (ii) for Options, if a change-in-control occurs prior to any vesting date, the Options would remain outstanding and vest in accordance with the vesting schedule, or, if earlier, accelerate and vest upon a qualified termination event following a change-in-control; and (iii) for performance shares, if a change-in-control occurs, performance would be measured at the date of the change-in-control, and the number of performance shares earned to be determined as of the date of the change-in-control as follows:
Any performance shares that are not earned at the change-in-control date would be forfeited. The vesting of these equity incentives is applicable to all grantees under the Plan.
The number of shares underlying the performance share awards will be earned and paid out at the end of the performance period, or, if earlier, as a double-trigger payment on the date of termination of employment following or in connection with the change-in-control.
For purposes of the change-in-control agreements and the vesting of unvested equity incentives as described above, a change-in-control, subject to certain exceptions, means:
The change-in-control agreement for Mr. Franklin and the form of change-in-control agreement for the other named executive officers have been filed with the SEC as exhibits to the Company's periodic report filings.
Executive Compensation
Retirement and other Benefits
Under the terms of our qualified and non-qualified defined benefit retirement plans, eligible salaried employees, including the certain named executive officers, are entitled to certain pension benefits upon their termination, retirement, death or disability. In general, the terms under which benefits are payable upon these triggering events are the same for all participants under the qualified and non-qualified plans. The present value of accumulated pension benefits, assumed payable at the earliest unreduced age (or current age, if later), for the named executive officers is set forth in the Pension Benefits Table on page 42. The pension benefit values included in the tables on pages 49 through 51 reflect the incremental value above the amounts shown in the Pension Benefits Table for benefits payable upon each triggering event from all pension plans in the aggregate.
The Company sponsors postretirement medical plans to subsidize retiree medical benefits for employees hired prior to certain dates starting in 2003. Under the postretirement medical plans, employees are generally eligible to retire upon attainment of age 55 and completion of 15 years of service. Upon retirement, eligible participants are entitled to receive subsidized medical benefits prior to attainment of age 65 where the subsidy provided is based upon age and years of service upon retirement. Upon attainment of age 65, eligible participants are entitled to receive employer contributions into a premium reimbursement account which may be used by the retiree in paying medical and prescription drug benefit premiums. Mr. Fox is eligible for these benefits. The postretirement medical benefits shown in the tables on pages 49 through 51 are those which are payable from the Company under each of the triggering events.
Assumptions used to determine the values are the same as those disclosed on the Company's financial statements. In addition, the Company assumes immediate termination, retirement, death or disability have occurred at December 31, 2018 for purposes of the tables on pages 49 through 51. Participants not eligible to receive benefits if leaving under a triggering event as of December 31, 2018 are shown with zero value in the tables.
Upon termination for any reason, the named executive officer in our Executive Deferral Plan, would be entitled to a distribution of their account balances as set forth in the Non-qualified Deferred Compensation table on page 45, subject to the restrictions under the Executive Deferral Plan described on page 34. The values of these account balances are not included in the tables on pages 49 through 51. The named executive officers are also eligible for the same death and disability benefits of other eligible salaried employees. These common benefits are not included in the tables on pages 49 through 51.
Under the terms of the 2009 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, as amended (the "Plan"):
Under the terms of the RSUs granted under the Plan, grantees of RSUs will (i) vest in a pro-rata portion of unvested grants upon the grantee's termination of employment as a result of retirement, or (ii) vest immediately in unvested grants following the grantee's termination of employment as a result of death or disability. Shares of Company stock equal to the applicable portion of the restricted stock units shall be issued to the grantee within 60 days following the grantee's retirement, death or disability, subject to applicable tax withholding and the values of these restricted stock units as of December 31, 2018 are included in the tables on pages 49 through 51.
Under the terms of the performance share unit grants under the Plan, grantees of performance share units will (i) earn a pro-rata portion of unvested grants upon the grantee's termination of employment as a result of retirement or earn immediately any unvested grants following the grantee's termination of employment as a result of death or disability. Shares of Company stock equal to the applicable portion of the performance share units shall be issued to the grantee on the vesting date for such performance share units and the estimated values of these performance share units based on interim performance through December 31, 2018 are included in the tables on pages 49 through 51. For purposes of the performance share units tied to the performance goal of cumulative earnings before taxes, the Company's actual performance is measured against a pro-rata portion of the performance goal as of year-end. Actual performance results for the full performance period may be substantially different from the amounts presented in the tables on pages 49 through 51.
Executive Compensation
Termination
With respect to a termination event other than in connection with a change-in-control, the severance plan applicable to the named executive officers other than Mr. Franklin, and Mr. Franklin's Employment Agreement as described on pages 49 through 51, provides the named executive officers with a severance benefit of one full year salary and one full year projected bonus or a minimum of one month of continued medical benefits of the named executive officer is terminated for any reason other than for cause.
In addition, once vested, participants are eligible to receive qualified benefits under the Retirement Plan and nonqualified benefits from the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan. Benefits vest upon attaining five years of service. Pension benefits for Messrs. Franklin, Fox, and Luning are vested and payable from the Retirement Plan as well as the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan.
The full value of the benefits payable due to termination is determined based on the assumed timing and form of the benefits payable as follows: the benefits for Messrs. Franklin, Fox and Luning are payable as an immediate lump sum payment or life annuity from the Retirement Plan and an immediate lump sum payment at age 55 from the non-qualified plans. Benefits have been reduced for early commencement by 3% per year of commencement prior to age 65.
Retirement
In the case of retirement, the present value of benefits is determined in the same manner as termination. Messrs. Franklin, Rhodes, Schuller, and Luning are not currently eligible for retirement benefits. Mr. Fox is eligible for retirement.
Death
Vested benefits under the Retirement Plan are payable to the participant's surviving spouse as a single life annuity upon the death of the participant. The benefit will be paid to the spouse as early as the deceased participant's earliest retirement age (age 55 with ten years of service or age 65). The benefit will be equal to 75% of the benefit calculated as if the participant had separated from service on the date of death (assumed to be December 31, 2018 in the tables on pages 49 through 51), survived to the earliest retirement age and retired with a qualified contingent annuity. Vested benefits under the Non-Qualified Pension Benefit Plan are payable to the participant's surviving spouse as a lump sum (or in certain cases transferred to the Company's Executive Deferral Plan) upon the death of the participant. The benefit will be equal to 75% of the benefit calculated as if the participant had separated from service on the date of death (assumed to be December 31, 2018 in the tables on pages 49 through 51), survived to the earliest retirement age and retired with a qualified contingent annuity. For each of the participants, the total present value of pension benefits payable upon death is less than the amount shown in the Pension Benefits Table. For purposes of the benefit calculations shown, spouses are assumed to be three years younger than the participant.
Disability
If an individual is terminated as a result of a disability with less than ten years of service, the benefits are payable in the same amount and form as an individual who is terminated. Individuals who terminate employment as a result of a disability with at least ten years of service are entitled to future accruals until age 65 (or earlier date if elected by the participant) assuming level future earnings and continued service. The benefits are not payable until age 65, unless elected by the participant for an earlier age. Upon the attainment of age 65, the individual would be entitled to the same options as an individual who retired from the Retirement Plan.
Messrs. Franklin, Fox, and Luning have each completed ten years of service. Therefore, for purposes of this present value calculation, these participants are assumed to accrue additional service and earnings until age 65, at which time pension payments are assumed to commence. Mr. Schuller and Mr. Rhodes have not completed ten years of service.
Executive Compensation
Termination Events Compensation
The total estimated value of the payments that would be triggered by a termination following a change-in-control, a termination other than for cause without a change-in-control, retirement, death or disability for the named executive officers calculated assuming that the triggering event for the payments occurred on December 31, 2018 and assuming a value for our Common Stock as of December 31, 2018 for purposes of valuing the vesting of the equity incentives are set forth below:
Executive Compensation
Executive Compensation
In 2009, our Board adopted, and our shareholders approved, our 2009 Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan, and the Board has subsequently amended the Plan from time to time (as amended, the "2009 Plan"). Under the terms of the 2009 Plan, it expires in May 2019. As such, the Board of Directors, on February 28, 2019, approved the Amended and Restated Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan (the "Plan").
The purpose of the Plan is to provide participants with the opportunity to receive grants that will encourage them to contribute to our success, align the economic interests of participants with those of our shareholders, and provide a means through which we can attract and retain officers, other key employees, non-employee directors and consultants and advisors of significant talent and abilities for the benefit of our shareholders and customers. Under the terms of the Plan, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors may grant stock options, dividend equivalents, stock units, stock awards, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards to officers, directors, key employees and key consultants of Aqua America and our subsidiaries who are in a position to contribute materially to the successful operation of our business.
The Plan reflects the number of shares approved by the shareholders in 2009, as adjusted for a subsequent stock split in 2013. No changes have been made to the number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2009 Plan. Therefore, approval of this Proposal No. 4 will not increase the number of shares available for issuance under the Plan or otherwise increase the potential dilution to shareholders as a result of the extension of the Plan.
The principal change to the Plan is to extend the term of the Plan until May 2, 2029, assuming receipt of shareholder approval of this Proposal No. 4 at the Annual Meeting. The additional updating changes we have made to the Plan include: (i) establishing minimum vesting or forfeiture periods for all awards; (ii) revising the Plan to reflect elimination of certain requirements, on a going forward basis, related to performance-based compensation to reflect the changes to Section 162(m) of the Code in light of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017; (iii) clarifying and including in the Plan the standard impact of various termination of service events on outstanding awards; (iv) adding an automatic exercise feature for expiring in-the-money stock options; and (v) providing each of the Board and the Compensation Committee with the authority to amend or terminate the Plan.
The Board recommends that the shareholders approve the Plan as submitted to shareholders, because the Board believes that the Plan is a vital component of the Company's performance-based compensation programs, provides appropriate flexibility for the Board to properly incent management and helps to enhance shareholder value.
Plan Summary
The following summary of the material terms of the amended Plan is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the amended Plan, which is set forth in Appendix C to this Proxy Statement.
General
The Plan provides that grants may be made in any of the following forms
Subject to adjustment as described below, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock that may be issued or transferred under the Plan (including pursuant to awards granted prior to amendment) is 6,250,000 shares, which reflects the original 5,000,000 shares authorized with the adoption of the Plan at our 2009 annual meeting of shareholders, adjusted for the 25% stock split effective as of September 1, 2013. As of December 31, 2018, the number of shares available for future grants under the Plan was 3,947,733.
Proposal 4
If and to the extent that options and SARs granted under the Plan terminate, expire or are cancelled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered without being exercised or if any stock awards, stock units, or other stock-based awards are forfeited, terminated, or otherwise not paid in full, the shares subject to such grants will become available again for purposes of the Plan. If we repurchase our shares on the open market with the proceeds from the exercise price of options, the repurchased shares are not available for future issuance under the Plan.
Administration of the Plan
The Plan is administered and interpreted by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"). However, the Board of Directors approves and administers all grants made to non-employee directors. References to the "Compensation Committee" include the Board, as applicable to grants to non-employee directors. The Compensation Committee may delegate authority to administer the Plan to one or more subcommittees, as it deems appropriate.
The Compensation Committee has the authority to (i) determine the individuals to whom grants will be made under the Plan, (ii) determine the type, size, terms and conditions of the grants, (iii) determine when grants will be made and the duration of any applicable exercise or restriction period, including the criteria for exercisability and the acceleration of exercisability, (iv) amend the terms and conditions of any previously issued grant, subject to the limitations described below, and (v) deal with any other matters arising under the Plan.
The Compensation Committee presently consists of Ellen T. Ruff (Chair), Elizabeth B. Amato and Daniel Hilferty, each of whom is an independent non-employee director.
Eligibility for Participation
All of the employees of the Company and each of its subsidiaries, all non-employee directors, and consultants and advisors who perform services for us and our subsidiaries are eligible to receive grants under the Plan. As of March 4, 2019, there were approximately 1,600 employees, 7 non-employee directors, and 14 consultants and advisors eligible to receive grants under the Plan. Except with respect to non-employee directors, the Compensation Committee is authorized to select the persons to receive grants from among those eligible and to determine the number of shares of our Common Stock that are subject to each grant.
Types of Awards
Stock Options. The Compensation Committee may grant options intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of section 422 of the Code ("ISOs") or "nonqualified stock options" that are not intended to so qualify ("NQSOs") or any combination of ISOs and NQSOs. Anyone eligible to participate in the Plan may receive a grant of NQSOs. Only our employees and employees of our subsidiaries may receive a grant of ISOs.
The Compensation Committee will fix the exercise price per share of options on the date of grant. The exercise price of options granted under the Plan must be equal to or greater than the last reported sale price of the underlying shares of our Common Stock on the date of grant. However, if the grantee of an ISO is a person who holds more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding stock, the exercise price per share of an ISO granted to such person must be at least 110% of the last reported sale price of a share of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
The Compensation Committee will determine the term of each option which will not exceed ten years from the date of grant. If the grantee of an ISO is a person who holds more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of our outstanding stock, the term of the ISO may not exceed five years from the date of grant. To the extent that the aggregate fair market value of shares of the Common Stock, determined on the date of grant, with respect to which ISOs become exercisable for the first time by a grantee during any calendar year exceeds $100,000, such ISOs will be treated as NQSOs.
The Compensation Committee will determine the terms and conditions of options, including when they become exercisable. The vesting schedule for any option must be a minimum of six months. The Compensation Committee will also determine under what circumstances a grantee may exercise an option after termination of employment or service. Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, a grantee's unvested options terminate as of the date a grantee ceases to provide continuous service to us and any unvested options may be exercised for 90 days after the date on which continuous service ceased. However, if a grantee ceases to provide continuous service to us on account of termination for cause, the grantee's options (whether vested or unvested) will terminate immediately. For purposes of the Plan, "continuous service" means that the grantee's service with us is not interrupted or terminated. The grantee's continuous service will not have terminated merely because of a change in capacity in which the grantee renders service to us or a change in the entity for which the grantee renders such service, provided that there is no interruption or termination of the grantee's continuous service; subject to compliance with Section 409A of the Code, if applicable.
Proposal 4
A grantee may exercise an option by delivering notice of exercise to us. The grantee will pay the exercise price and any withholding taxes for the option: (i) in cash, (ii) unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, by delivering shares of Common Stock already owned by the grantee and having a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the exercise price or by attestation to ownership of shares of Common Stock having a fair market value on the date of exercise at least equal to the exercise price, (iii) by payment through a broker in accordance with the procedures permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board, or (iv) by such other method as the Compensation Committee may approve.
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, or inapplicable based on instructions from a grantee, each option that is outstanding on the last business day of the applicable term that was established by the Committee for such option (the "Automatic Exercise Date") with an exercise price per share that is less than the fair market value per share of our Common Stock as of that date will automatically be exercised on the Automatic Exercise Date. Payment of the exercise price of any such option and related tax obligations will be "net settled" to the maximum extent permitted by law. The automatic exercise does not apply to an option if the grantee incurs a termination of continuous service on or before the Automatic Exercise Date.
Stock Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant stock awards to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan. The Compensation Committee may require that grantees pay consideration for the stock awards and may impose restrictions on the stock awards. If restrictions are imposed on stock awards, the Compensation Committee will determine whether they will lapse over a period of time, on a particular date or according to such other criteria as the Compensation Committee determines. The minimum restriction period for stock awards with a restriction period is one year from the date of grant.
The Compensation Committee will determine the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the grant of stock awards and the other terms and conditions of the grant. Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, a grantee will have the right to vote shares of Common Stock and to receive dividends paid on such shares during the restriction period. However, any dividends with respect to performance-based stock awards will be withheld and become payable only if and to the extent that the restrictions on the underlying stock awards lapse, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
All restrictions imposed on stock awards will lapse upon expiration of the applicable restriction period and the satisfaction of all conditions, if any, imposed by the Compensation Committee.
If a grantee ceases to provide continuous service to us during the restriction period, or if other specified conditions are not met, then the grantee's stock award will terminate as to all shares covered by the award as to which the restrictions have not lapsed, and those shares of Common Stock must be immediately returned to us. If a grantee has an early retirement or normal retirement event during the restriction period, the number of stock awards that vest will be pro-rated to the date of such early retirement or normal retirement, as the case may be. Such payment will be made no earlier than the end of the restriction period (or the end of the period during which the grantee must render continuous service, if later) and no later than 75 days following the later of the end of the performance period or the end of the period of continuous service.
Stock Units. The Compensation Committee may grant stock units to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan. Each stock unit provides the grantee with the right to receive a share of Common Stock or an amount based on the value of a share of Common Stock at a future date. The Compensation Committee will determine the number of stock units that will be granted, whether stock units will become payable based on achievement of performance goals, service requirements and/or other conditions, whether stock units will be settled in cash or stock, and the other terms and conditions applicable to stock units. If a restriction period is established for a stock units grant, it will be a minimum of one year.
Stock units may be paid at the end of a specified period or deferred to a date authorized by the Compensation Committee. If a stock unit becomes distributable, it will be paid to the grantee in cash, in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee. If a grantee ceases to provide continuous service to us before the stock units vest, or if other conditions are not met, the grantee's stock units will be forfeited, provided, however if a grantee has an early retirement or normal retirement event prior to the vesting of stock units, the number of stock units that will vest will be pro-rated to the date of such early retirement or normal retirement, as the case may be. Such payment will be made no earlier than the end of the restriction period (or the end of the period during which the grantee must render continuous service, if later) and no later than 75 days following the later of the end of the performance period or the end of the period of continuous service.
SARs. The Compensation Committee may grant SARs to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan. SARs may be granted in connection with, or independently of, any option granted under the Plan. Upon exercise of an SAR, the grantee will receive an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of exercise over the base amount for the SAR. Payment will be made in cash, shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
The base amount of each SAR will be determined by the Compensation Committee and will be equal to the per share exercise price of the related option or, if there is no related option, an amount that is at least equal to the last reported sale price of a share of the Common Stock on the date of grant of the SAR. The Compensation Committee will determine the terms and conditions of SARs, including when they become exercisable. The Compensation Committee may accelerate the exercisability of any SARs.
Proposal 4
SARs may only be exercised while the grantee is providing continuous service to us or within a specified period of time after termination of employment or service, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Dividend Equivalents. The Compensation Committee may grant dividend equivalents to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan either alone or in conjunction with all or any part of any stock units or other stock-based awards granted under the Plan. A dividend equivalent is equal to the dividend payable on a share of Common Stock. We will credit to an account maintained for the grantee on our books and records on each record date an amount that is generally equal to the dividend equivalents subject to the grant during the accumulation period designated by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will determine the terms and conditions applicable to any dividend equivalents. However, any dividend equivalents granted in connection with performance-based stock units or other stock-based awards will be withheld and will be paid only if and to the extent that the restrictions on the related stock units or other stock-based awards lapse, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
The amount of a dividend equivalent (the "dividend equivalent amount") is determined by applying the following factors: (i) the number of dividend equivalents granted, (ii) the per-share cash dividend, or the per-share fair market value of any non-cash dividend, payable by us during the applicable accumulation period and (iii) the length of the applicable accumulation period designated by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, any stand-alone dividend equivalent amounts accrued in a grantee's account between the date of the grant to March 1 of the following year will be distributed to the grantee no later than March 15 of the year following the date of grant, and any dividend equivalent amounts accrued in an account from March 2 of the year following the date of grant (or any anniversary thereof) through March 1 of the following year will be distributed to the grantee no later than March 15 of such following year, subject to the grantee's continuous service to us. However, dividend equivalents granted in connection with performance-based stock units or other stock-based awards will instead be distributed at the time the underlying awards are distributed, to the extent that the underlying awards become payable.
Other Stock-Based Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant other stock-based awards, which are grants other than options, SARs, stock units, and stock awards. The Compensation Committee may grant other stock-based awards to anyone eligible to participate in the Plan. These grants will be based on or measured by shares of Common Stock, and will be payable in cash, in shares of Common Stock, or in a combination of cash and shares of Common Stock. The terms and conditions for other stock-based awards will be determined by the Compensation Committee.
Qualified Performance-Based Compensation
The Compensation Committee may determine that grants of options, stock units, stock awards, or other stock-based awards granted to employees under the Plan will have performance goals and a performance period or performance-based vesting. The Compensation Committee will establish, in writing, the performance goals and the performance period or vesting schedule for each applicable award; provided, however, that whether the determination of the performance goals and performance period or vesting schedule for any award for which the Compensation Committee has delegated authority under the Plan, the authority to establish performance goals, a performance period or performance vesting is also delegated. Such performance goals may vary by grantee or by award. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, may adjust or modify the calculation of performance goals to prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of awardees.
Adjustment Provisions
If there is any change in the number or kind of shares of our Common Stock outstanding by reason of (i) a stock dividend, spinoff, recapitalization, stock split, or combination or exchange of shares, (ii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation, (iii) a reclassification or change in par value, or (iv) any other extraordinary or unusual event affecting the outstanding shares of Common Stock as a class without our receipt of consideration, or if the value of outstanding shares of the Common Stock is substantially reduced as a result of a spinoff or payment by us of an extraordinary dividend or distribution, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available for issuance under the Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock for which any individual may receive grants in any year, the kind and number of shares covered by outstanding grants, the kind and number of shares issued and to be issued under the Plan, and the price per share or the applicable market value of such grants will be equitably adjusted by the Compensation Committee, in such manner as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of, or change in the kind or value of, the issued shares of the Common Stock to preclude, to the extent practicable, the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under the Plan and such outstanding grants. Any fractional shares resulting from such adjustment will be eliminated, and the number of shares covered by outstanding grants may be rounded up or down, as determined by the Compensation Committee, subject to compliance with sections 424 and 409A of the Code and the applicable share limits under the Plan. In the event of a change in control, the Plan provisions applicable to a change in control will apply. Any adjustments to outstanding grants will be consistent with section 409A or 422 of the Code, to the extent applicable.
Proposal 4
Change in Control of the Company
The Plan does not provide for automatic vesting of outstanding grants upon the occurrence of a change in control. Instead, in the event of a change in control, the Compensation Committee may take any of the following actions with respect to any or all outstanding grants under the Plan: (i) accelerate the vesting of outstanding options and SARs upon a specified termination of employment or service associated with the change in control event; (ii) provide for the lapse of the restrictions and conditions on outstanding stock awards upon a specified termination of employment or service associated with the change in control event; (iii) accelerate the vesting of stock units, other stock-based awards and unpaid dividend equivalent amounts and provide that they will be paid at their target values, or in such greater amounts as the Compensation Committee may determine, upon a specified termination of employment or service associated with the change in control event; (iv) require that grantees surrender their options and SARs in exchange for payment by us, in cash or shares of Common Stock as determined by the Compensation Committee, in an amount, if any, equal to the amount by which the then fair market value of the shares subject to the grantee's unexercised options and SARs exceeds the exercise price of the options or the base amount of the SARs, as applicable, (v) after giving grantees the opportunity to exercise their options and SARs, terminate any or all unexercised options and SARs at such time as the Compensation Committee deems appropriate, or (vi) determine that outstanding options and SARs that are not exercised will be assumed by, or replaced with comparable options or rights by, the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), and other outstanding grants that remain in effect after the change in control will be converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation). If the per share fair market value of our stock does not exceed the per share exercise price of an option or base amount of an SAR at the time of surrender or termination, the option or SAR may be surrendered or terminated for no consideration.
A change in control will be deemed to have taken place if any one of the following events occurs:
Transferability of Grants
Only the grantee may exercise rights under a grant during the grantee's lifetime. A grantee may not transfer those rights except by will or the laws of descent and distribution; provided, however, that a grantee may transfer a grant other than an ISO pursuant to a domestic relations order. The Compensation Committee may also provide, in a grant agreement, that a grantee may transfer NQSOs to his or her family members, or one or more trusts or other entities for the benefit of or owned by such family members, consistent with applicable securities laws, according to such terms as the Compensation Committee may determine.
No Repricing of Options
Except in connection with certain corporate transactions involving all of the Company's stock (including any stock dividend, distribution, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, repurchase or exchange of shares of our Common Stock or other securities, or similar transaction), we may not, without obtaining shareholder approval: (i) amend the terms of outstanding options or SARs to reduce their exercise price or base price, as applicable; (ii) cancel outstanding options or SARs in exchange for options or SARs with an exercise price or base price, as applicable, that is less than the exercise price or base price of the original grant; or (iii) cancel outstanding options or SARs with an exercise price or base price, as applicable, above the then current price of our Common Stock in exchange for cash or other securities. In addition, neither the Board nor the Compensation Committee may amend the Plan to permit the actions in (i), (ii) or (iii), without prior shareholder approval.
Company Clawback and other Policies
All grants made under the Plan will be subject to any applicable clawback or recoupment policies, share trading policies and other policies that may be implemented by the Board from time to time.
Proposal 4
Amendment and Termination of the Plan
The Board or the Compensation Committee may amend or terminate the Plan at any time, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required under any applicable laws or stock exchange requirements. Following approval of Proposal No. 4 at the Annual Meeting, the Plan will terminate on May 2, 2029, unless the Plan is terminated earlier by the Board or the Compensation Committee or is extended by the Board or Compensation Committee with shareholder consent.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards
The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Plan. The summary is based on U.S. federal income tax laws and regulations presently in effect, which are subject to change, possibly retroactively. Tax laws are complex and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. This discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the U.S. federal income tax aspects of the Plan and does not address state, local or foreign tax consequences. All participants in the Plan are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign income and other tax consequences of participating in the Plan based on the participant's personal circumstances.
Nonqualified Stock Options. Under the Code, the grant of a nonqualified stock option is generally not taxable to the grantee. On exercise of a nonqualified stock option granted under the Plan, a grantee will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the exercise price. The grantee's tax basis in those shares will be equal to their fair market value on the date of exercise of the option, and the grantee's holding period for those shares will begin on that date. Upon a grantee's sale of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, any difference between the sale price and the fair market value of the shares on the date when the stock option was exercised will be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss.
If a grantee pays for shares of stock on exercise of an option by delivering shares of Common Stock, the grantee will not recognize gain or loss on the shares delivered, even if the fair market value of such shares differs from the grantee's tax basis in such shares. The grantee, however, will be taxed on the exercise of the option in the manner described above as if he had paid the exercise price in cash. The tax basis of the shares received upon exercise will be the tax basis of the shares delivered as payment, share for share, to the extent the number of shares received equals the number of shares delivered as payment. In addition, the holding period of the shares received will include the holding period of the shares delivered as payment. The grantee's tax basis and holding period for any shares received in excess of the number of shares delivered by the grantee will be the same as if the grantee had exercised the option solely in exchange for cash.
Upon a grantee's exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the Company or the applicable subsidiary will generally be entitled to a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes at such time and in the same amount recognized as ordinary income to the grantee, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Section 280G of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in such Section, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.
Incentive Stock Options. The Plan provides for the grant of stock options that qualify as ISOs. Under the Code, a grantee generally is not subject to tax upon the grant or exercise of an ISO. In addition, if the grantee holds a share of stock received on exercise of an ISO for at least two years from the date the option was granted and at least one year from the date the option was exercised (the "Required Holding Period"), the difference, if any, between the amount realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of that share and the holder's tax basis in that share will be long-term capital gain or loss.
If, however, a grantee disposes of a share of stock acquired on exercise of an ISO before the end of the Required Holding Period, (a "Disqualifying Disposition") the grantee generally will recognize ordinary income in the year of the Disqualifying Disposition equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the share on the date the ISO was exercised (or, if less, the amount realized on such Disqualifying Disposition) over the exercise price. If the amount realized on a Disqualifying Disposition exceeds the fair market value of the share on the date of exercise of the option, the excess gain recognized will be short-term or long-term capital gain, depending upon the length of time the shares have been held after the date of exercise.
If a grantee exercises an ISO by delivering shares of stock acquired by an earlier exercise of an ISO, and the previously acquired shares have not been held for the Required Holding Period, the grantee will recognize ordinary income on the Disqualifying Disposition.
For purposes of the alternative minimum tax, the amount by which the fair market value of a share of stock acquired on exercise of an ISO exceeds the exercise price of that option generally will be an adjustment included in the grantee's alternative minimum taxable income for the year in which the option is exercised. If, however, there is a Disqualifying Disposition of the share in the year in which the option is exercised, there will be no adjustment with respect to that share. If there is a Disqualifying Disposition in a later year, no income with respect to the Disqualifying Disposition is included in the grantee's alternative minimum taxable income for that year.
Proposal 4
The Company is not entitled to take a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option or the disposition of a share acquired on exercise of an incentive stock option after the Required Holding Period. However, if there is a Disqualifying Disposition of a share, the Company is entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income includible in income by the grantee, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Section 280G of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in such Section, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.
Stock Awards. Generally, the grantee of a stock award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the stock is received equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock received over any amount paid by the grantee in exchange for the stock. If, however, the stock is not vested when it is received under the Plan (for example, if the grantee is required to work for a period of time in order to have the right to sell the stock), the grantee generally will not recognize income until the stock becomes vested, at which time the grantee will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the stock on the date it becomes vested over any amount paid by the grantee in exchange for the stock. A grantee may, however, file a "section 83(b) election" with the Internal Revenue Service, within 30 days of his or her receipt of the stock award, to recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the shares are awarded in an amount equal to their fair market value at that time, notwithstanding that such share are not vested and may be subsequently forfeited. If a grantee makes such an election, the grantee will not recognize any additional taxable income at the time the shares become vested, but if the shares are later forfeited, the grantee will not be allowed a tax deduction for the forfeited shares.
The grantee's basis for the determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of shares acquired as stock awards will be the amount paid for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized either when the stock is received or when the stock becomes vested. Upon the disposition of any stock received as a stock award under the Plan, the difference between the sales price and the grantee's basis in the shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss and generally will be characterized as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year from the date as of which he or she would be required to recognize any compensation income.
The Company will be entitled to a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income taxable to the grantee, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Section 280G of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in such Section, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.
Stock Units. A grantee normally will not realize taxable income upon the award of stock units. A grantee will be subject to tax on the earlier of the year in which the grantee receives the underlying shares of Common Stock or the year in which the award is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. In that year, the grantee will recognize income equal to the fair market value of the shares of the Common Stock received, or no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, and the Company will be entitled to a deduction in the same amount, provided that such amount constitutes an ordinary and necessary business expense for the Company and is reasonable in amount, and either the employee includes that amount in income or the Company timely satisfies its reporting requirements with respect to that amount.
Stock Appreciation Rights. The Company may grant SARs separate from any other award or in tandem with options under the Plan. Generally, the grantee of an SAR will not recognize any taxable income at the time the SAR is granted. When the SAR is exercised, the grantee receives the appreciation inherent in the SARs in cash and such cash will be taxable as ordinary compensation income to the grantee at the time that the cash is received. If the grantee receives the appreciation inherent in the SARs in shares of stock, the grantee will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock on the day it is received over any amounts paid by the grantee for the stock. The Company will be entitled to a deduction for U.S. Federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the amount recognized by the grantee as ordinary income, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Section 280G of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in such Section, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.
SARs may be issued in tandem with a stock option. Under this type of arrangement, the exercise of a SAR will result in the cancellation of an option, and the exercise of an option will result in a cancellation of a SAR. If the grantee of a tandem SAR elects to surrender the underlying option in exchange for cash or shares of stock equal to the appreciation inherent in the underlying option, the tax consequences to the grantee will be the same as discussed above relating to the SARs. If the grantee elects to exercise the underlying option, the grantee will be taxed at the time of exercise as if he or she had exercised a nonqualified stock option, as previously discussed above. As a result, the grantee will recognize ordinary income for federal tax purposes measured by the excess of the then fair market value of the shares of stock over the exercise price.
Dividend Equivalents. Generally, the grantee of a dividend equivalent award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the dividend equivalent award is received equal to the fair market value of the amount received. The Company generally will be entitled to a deduction for U.S. Federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that the employee is required to recognize as a result of the dividend equivalent award, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Section 280G of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in such Section, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.
Proposal 4
Other Stock Awards. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of any other stock awards will depend upon the specific facts and circumstances of each award, including, in particular, the nature of any restrictions imposed with respect to the awards.
Performance-based Awards. A grantee who has been granted a performance-based award generally will not recognize taxable income at the time of grant, and the Company will not be entitled to a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes at that time. When an award is paid, whether in cash or shares of Common Stock, the grantee generally will recognize ordinary income, and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. The grantee's tax basis in any shares acquired pursuant to a performance-based award is the amount recognized by him or her as income attributable to such shares. Upon a subsequent disposition of the shares, the grantee will generally realize a capital gain or loss, as applicable.
Tax Withholding. Ordinary income recognized in connection with the receipt or exercise of an award under the Plan is subject to income and employment tax wage withholding, unless the participant is not an employee of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate. The Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate, may deduct from all payments made under the Plan, an amount (which may include shares of Common Stock) to satisfy any federal, state, local or foreign withholding obligations with respect to any award.
Section 409A of the Code. Section 409A of the Code governs the taxation of deferred compensation. Awards received under the Plan are intended to be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A where possible. However, there can be no assurance that awards designed to be exempt from Section 409A will in fact be exempt. An award that is subject to Section 409A and fails to satisfy its requirements will subject the holder of the award to immediate taxation, an interest penalty and an additional 20% tax on the amount underlying the award.
Section 280G of the Code. Under certain circumstances, the accelerated vesting or exercise of options or the accelerated lapse of restrictions on stock awards in connection with a change in control could be deemed an "excess parachute payment" for purposes of the parachute tax provisions of Section 280G of the Code. In that event, the grantee could be subject to a 20% excise tax and the Company or applicable subsidiary could be denied a tax deduction with respect to a portion of the grants.
Summary of Grants Under the Plan
Grants under the Plan are discretionary, so it is currently not possible to predict the number of shares of Common Stock that will be granted or who will receive grants under the Plan after the 2019 Annual Meeting. For information with respect to grants to our named executive officers during 2018 under the Plan, see the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on page 39 and for information with respect to grants to our non-employee directors, see the Director Compensation table on page 18. The following table sets for the number of shares of our Common Stock underlying grants made in 2018 under the Plan to our named executive officers, all executive officers as a group, all non-executive officer employees as a group and our non-employee directors:
The last reported sale price of our Common Stock on March 4, 2019 was $36.34 per share.
Ownership of Common Stock
The following table sets forth certain information as of March 4, 2019 with respect to shares of Common Stock of the Company beneficially owned by: (1) each person known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Common Stock of the Company; (2) each director, nominee for director and executive officer named in the Summary Compensation Table; and (3) all directors, nominees and executive officers of the Company as a group.

Questions and Answers about the 2019 Annual Meeting
Who is entitled to vote?
Holders of shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") of record at the close of business on March 9, 2019 are entitled to vote at the meeting. Each shareholder entitled to vote shall have the right to one vote on each matter presented at the meeting for each share of Common Stock outstanding in such shareholder's name.
How many shares can vote?
As of March 4, 2019, there were 178,362,753 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to be voted at the meeting. Shares can be voted in the following four ways:
What is the proxy?
The proxy card or electronic proxy that you are being asked to give is a means by which a shareholder may authorize the voting of his or her shares at the meeting if he or she is unable to attend in person. The individuals to whom you are giving a proxy to vote your shares are Christopher P. Luning, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, and Daniel J. Schuller, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
The shares of Common Stock represented by each properly executed proxy card or electronic proxy will be voted at the meeting in accordance with each shareholder's direction. Shareholders are urged to specify their choices by marking the appropriate boxes on the proxy card or electronic proxy, or voting via telephone. If the proxy card or electronic proxy is signed, but no choice has been specified, the shares will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors. If any other matters are properly presented at the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof for action, the proxy holders will vote the proxies (which confer discretionary authority to vote on such matters) in accordance with their judgment.
If a proxy is executed, can a shareholder still attend the meeting in person?
Yes, execution of the accompanying proxy or voting through an electronic proxy or voting by telephone will not affect a shareholder's right to attend the meeting and, if desired, vote in person. You can submit a proxy and still attend the meeting without voting in person.
Can a shareholder revoke or change his or her vote?
Yes. Any shareholder giving a proxy card or voting by electronic proxy or voting by telephone has the right to revoke the proxy or the electronic or telephonic vote by giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time before the proxy is voted, by executing a proxy bearing a later date, by making a later-dated vote electronically or by telephone, or by attending the meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the meeting will not, by itself, revoke a previously granted proxy.
What is "Householding"?
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this procedure, multiple shareholders who share the same last name and address and do not participate in electronic delivery will receive only one copy of the Proxy Materials or the Notice. We have undertaken householding to reduce our printing costs and postage fees. Shareholders may elect to receive individual copies of the Proxy Materials or Notice at the same address by contacting Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. By telephone at 1-800-540-7095, or by mail at 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. Shareholders who are receiving individual copies of such materials, and who would like to receive single copies at a shared address, may contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. with this request by using the contact information provided above. Shareholders who are receiving individual copies of such materials, and who would like to receive single copies at a shared address, may contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. with this request by using the contact information provided above.

Questions and Answers about the 2019 Annual Meeting
What are the voting requirements to approve each proposal? What is the impact of abstentions and broker non-votes on each proposal?
The following table summarizes the vote required for the approval of each proposal and the impact, if any, of abstentions and broker-non votes.
The Company's Articles of Incorporation also provide that the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by those shareholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting is required to take action with respect to any matter properly brought before the meeting, other than the election of directors, on the recommendation of a vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors. The Company's Articles of Incorporation also provide that the affirmative vote of at least three quarters of the votes which all voting shareholders, voting as a single class, are entitled to cast is required to take action with respect to any other matter properly brought before the meeting, other than the election of directors, without the recommendation of a vote of a majority of the entire Board of Directors.
What is a quorum?
A quorum of shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting of shareholders for the transaction of business. The holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting, constitute a quorum. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.
What is a broker non-vote?
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a bank, broker or other holder of record holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power under NYSE rules for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. If you are a beneficial owner, your bank, broker or other holder of record is permitted under NYSE rules to vote your shares on the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, even if the record holder does not receive voting instructions from you. The record holder may not vote on the election of directors , the advisory vote on the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers for 2018 and the approval of the Aqua America, Inc. Amended and Restated Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan without instructions from you. Without your voting instructions on these matters, a broker non-vote will occur.
Information about Proposals under Consideration at this Meeting
How are directors elected?
Under the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting. A description of the Company's majority voting resignation policy is set forth in the answer to the question below. Votes may be cast FOR or WITHHOLD for each nominee. The director nominees who receive the highest number of votes up to the number of directors to be elected will be elected at the meeting. All of the directors elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting will be elected for one year terms expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified.
What if an incumbent director receives more WITHHOLD votes than FOR votes in an uncontested election?
The Board of Directors adheres to a majority voting resignation policy for the election of directors in uncontested elections. Under this policy, in an election where the only nominees are those recommended by the Board of Directors, any incumbent director who is nominated for re-election and who receives a greater number of WITHHOLD votes than FOR votes for the director's election must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors. The Board will evaluate the relevant facts and circumstances in connection with such director's resignation, giving due consideration to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Within 90 days after the election, the independent directors must make a decision on whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board of Directors will promptly disclose publicly its decision and the reasons for its decision.
The Board of Directors believes that this process enhances accountability to shareholders and responsiveness to shareholder votes, while allowing the Board of Directors appropriate discretion in considering whether a particular director's resignation would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company's majority voting resignation policy is set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Copies of the Corporate Governance Guidelines can be obtained free of charge from the Corporate Governance portion of the Investor Relations section of the Company's website: www.aquaamerica.com.
Why are the shareholders asked to vote on the ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm?
The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors carefully considers the qualifications of the independent auditors before engaging them to conduct an audit, and has the oversight authority with respect to the performance of the independent auditors. The Board of Directors thinks it is important to provide an opportunity for the shareholders to voice any concern with respect to the independent auditors selected, which is the reason for this ratification vote.
What is the impact of the advisory vote on the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, referred to as "Say on Pay" vote?
The Board of Directors and the Executive Compensation Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, value the opinions of the Company's shareholders and expect to take into account the outcome of the non-binding advisory vote when considering future executive compensation decisions to the extent they can determine the cause or causes of any significant negative voting results.
Process for Submitting Shareholder Proposals at the Next Annual Meeting
Who can submit a shareholder proposal at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders?
Shareholders may submit proposals, which are proper subjects for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Materials, which are this Proxy Statement and the form of proxy attached, for consideration at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders, by following the procedures prescribed by Rule 14a-8(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
What is the deadline for submitting shareholder proposals for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Materials for the next Annual Meeting?
To be eligible for inclusion in the Company's Proxy Materials relating to the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, proposals must be submitted in writing and received by the Company at the address below no later than November 23, 2019.
What is the deadline for proposing business to be considered at the next Annual Meeting, but not to have the proposed business included in the Company's Proxy Materials?
A shareholder of the Company may wish to propose business to be considered at an Annual Meeting of Shareholders, but not to have the proposed business included in the Company's Proxy Materials relating to that meeting. Section 3.17 of the Company's Bylaws requires that the Company receive written notice of business that a shareholder wishes to present for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (other than matters included in the Company's Proxy Materials) not earlier than January 3, 2020 or later than February 2, 2020. The notice must meet certain other requirements set forth in the Company's Bylaws. Copies of the Company's Bylaws can be obtained by submitting a written request to the Secretary of the Company.

Nominating Candidates for Director
How does a shareholder nominate a director for election to the Board of Directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting?
A shareholder entitled to vote for the election of directors may make a nomination for director provided that written notice (the "Nomination Notice") of the shareholder's intent to nominate a director at the meeting is filed with the Secretary of the Company prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting in accordance with provisions of the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
Section 4.14 of the Company's Bylaws requires the Nomination Notice to be received by the Secretary of the Company not less than 14 days nor more than 50 days prior to any meeting of the shareholders called for the election of directors, with certain exceptions. These notice requirements do not apply to nominations for which proxies are solicited under applicable regulations of the SEC. The Nomination Notice must contain or be accompanied by the following information:
What is the deadline for submitting a Nomination Notice for the 2019 Annual Meeting?
Pursuant to the above requirements, a Nomination Notice for the 2019 Annual Meeting must be received by the Secretary of the Company no later than April 18, 2019.
Who chooses the director candidates?
The Corporate Governance Committee identifies, evaluates and recommends director candidates to our Board of Directors for nomination. The process followed by our Corporate Governance Committee to identify and evaluate director candidates includes requests to current directors and others for recommendations, consideration of candidates proposed by shareholders, meetings from time to time to evaluate potential candidates and interviews of potential candidates.
How are director candidates evaluated?
In considering candidates for director, the Corporate Governance Committee will consider the candidate's personal abilities, qualifications, independence, knowledge, judgment, character, leadership skills, education, background and their expertise and experience in fields and disciplines relevant to the Company, including financial expertise or financial literacy. When assessing a candidate, consideration will be given to the effect such candidate will have on the diversity of the Board. Diversity of the Board is evaluated by considering a broad range of attributes, including, without limitation, race, gender and national origin, background, demographics, expertise and experience.
Due consideration will also be given to the position the candidate holds at the time of his or her nomination and his or her capabilities to advance the Company's interests with its various constituencies. The Corporate Governance Committee considers all of these qualities when selecting, subject to ratification by our Board of Directors, candidates for director. The Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate shareholder-recommended candidates in the same manner as it evaluates candidates recommended by others.
What is the deadline for submitting a shareholder recommendation for a director candidate at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders?
If you would like a director candidate considered by the Corporate Governance Committee for selection as a nominee at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, such recommendation should be submitted to the Chairperson of the Corporate Governance Committee at least 120 days before the date on which the Company first mailed its proxy materials for the prior year's Annual Meeting of Shareholders—that is, with respect to the 2020 Annual Meeting, no later than November 23, 2019.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities (a "10% Shareholder"), to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC.
