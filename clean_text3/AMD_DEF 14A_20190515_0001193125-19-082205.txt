NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
You are cordially invited to attend our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (our "Annual Meeting") to be held on Wednesday, May 15, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time at Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., 2485 Augustine Drive, Santa Clara, California 95054. We are holding our Annual Meeting to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Elect the seven director nominees named in this proxy statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current  fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approve the amendment and restatement of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and  restated, the "2004 Plan") to: (i) increase the number of authorized shares that can be awarded to our employees, consultants and directors under the 2004 Plan by 29 million shares and (ii) update the plan for certain tax  law changes;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approve on a non-binding, advisory basis the compensation of our named executive  officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transact any other business that properly comes before our Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof.   
[END TABLE]
We are pleased to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet under the SEC's "notice and access" rules. As a result, we are mailing to our stockholders (other than those who previously requested printed or emailed materials on an ongoing basis) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") instead of printed copies of our proxy materials. The Notice contains instructions on how to access our proxy materials on the Internet, how to vote on the Internet and how you can receive printed or emailed copies of our proxy materials. We believe that providing our proxy materials over the Internet will lower our Annual Meeting's cost and environmental impact, while increasing the ability of our stockholders to access the information that they need. 
Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 18, 2019 and holders of proxies for those stockholders may attend and vote at our Annual Meeting. To attend our Annual Meeting in person, you must present valid photo identification, and, if you hold shares through a broker, bank, trustee or nominee (i.e., in street name), you must also present a letter from your broker or other nominee showing that you were the beneficial owner of the shares on March 18, 2019. 
This year, we are also pleased to offer a virtual annual meeting at which our stockholders can view our Annual Meeting at AMD.onlineshareholdermeeting.com. This virtual meeting will be in addition to our physical meeting. Stockholders at the close of business on March 18, 2019 may also ask questions and vote at the virtual meeting via the Internet. We hope this will allow our stockholders who are unable to attend our Annual Meeting in person to participate in the virtual meeting. 
Sincerely, 
HARRY A. WOLIN 
Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate 
Secretary 
This notice of annual meeting is dated March 21, 2019 and will first be distributed and made available to the stockholders of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. on or about March 21, 2019.

          Beneficial Owner.

You may not vote your shares in  person at our Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares at our Annual Meeting and a letter from your broker or other nominee showing  that you were the beneficial owner of your shares on the Record Date.

 January 16, 2020 and February 15, 2020. However, if our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders is not held within 30 days of May 15, 2020, the stockholder's notice must be delivered no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the earlier of the day on which the first public announcement of the date of our 2020 annual meeting was made or the day the notice of our 2020 annual meeting is mailed. The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders will not trigger a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder notice as described in this proxy statement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is increased and we do not make a public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, the stockholder's notice will be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by the increase, if it is delivered to our Corporate Secretary not later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which we first make such public announcement. If necessary, the stockholder's notice must be updated and supplemented as set forth in our bylaws. The stockholder's notice must include the following information for the person making the nomination:

The Chair of our Annual Meeting will determine if the procedures in the bylaws have been followed, and if not, declare that the nomination be disregarded. If the nomination was made in accordance with the procedures in our bylaws, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will apply the same criteria in evaluating the nominee as it would any other Board nominee candidate and will recommend to the Board whether or not the stockholder nominee should be nominated by the Board and included in our proxy statement. These criteria are described below in the description of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in the section entitled "Meetings and Committees of the Board of Directors—Board Committees." The nominee must be willing to provide a written questionnaire, representation and agreement, if requested by us, and any other information reasonably requested by us in connection with our evaluation of the nominee's independence.

Our Corporate Secretary will forward all of these communications to our Chairman of the Board. 
Required Vote 
At our Annual Meeting, our directors will be elected using a majority vote standard with respect to uncontested elections, such as this election. This standard requires that each director receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed the

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Board has adopted the Governance Principles to address significant corporate governance issues. The Governance Principles provide a framework for our corporate governance matters and include topics such as Board and Board committee composition and evaluation. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing the Governance Principles and recommending any changes to the Governance Principles to the Board. 
Independence of Directors 
The Governance Principles provide that a substantial majority of the members of the Board must meet the criteria for independence as required by applicable law and the listing rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq"). Among other criteria, no director qualifies as independent unless the Board determines that the director has no direct material relationship which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. On an annual basis, the Board undertakes a review of director independence. The Board determined that all directors who served during fiscal 2018 and all of our director nominees, other than Mr. Yahia and Dr. Su, are independent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. 
In making its independence determinations, the Board reviewed direct and indirect transactions and relationships between each director, or any member of his or her immediate family, and us or one of our subsidiaries or affiliates based on information provided by the director, our records and publicly available information. All of the reviewed transactions and arrangements were entered into in the ordinary course of business and none of the transactions or arrangements involved an amount that (i) exceeded the greater of 5% of the recipient entity's revenues or $200,000 with respect to transactions where a director or any member of his or her immediate family or spouse served in any capacity other than as a director of a publicly held-corporation or (ii) exceeded $10,000 with respect to professional or consulting services provided by entities at which our directors serve as professors or employees. 
The Board determined that none of our directors currently has or has had any direct or indirect material interest in any transactions and arrangements that would interfere with their exercise of independent judgment as members of the Board. 
The Board also determined that each of the members of the Audit and Finance, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees are independent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During fiscal 2018, Ms. Denzel and Messrs. Donofrio (until May 2018), Durcan (appointed October 2018) and Talwalkar served on the Compensation Committee. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Ms. Denzel and Messrs. Durcan and Talwalkar. None of the members of the Compensation Committee is or has been an executive officer or employee of AMD. In addition, none of our executive officers serves on the board of directors or compensation committee of a company which has an executive officer who serves on our Board or Compensation Committee. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Governance Principles permit the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to be filled by the same or different individuals, based on our needs, best practices and the interests of our stockholders. This allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be combined or separated based upon our needs and the Board's assessment of its leadership from time to time. The Board has the experience of functioning effectively either way. 
The Board believes that its current leadership structure, with an independent Chairman of the Board, separate from the Chief Executive Officer, is the most appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time, is in the best interests of the stockholders and allows the Board to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently based on our current needs. 
Mr. Caldwell, who is independent in accordance with SEC and Nasdaq rules, is our Chairman of the Board. Mr. Caldwell presides at meetings of our stockholders and directors and leads the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. The Board benefits from Mr. Caldwell's extensive and diversified leadership experience, financial management and risk assessment experience. He also has strong public company board experience and has intimate familiarity with our history and business.

Corporate Governance (continued)
Separating the roles of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer also enables the independent directors to more meaningfully participate in the leadership of the Board. The Board believes this structure provides an appropriate degree of oversight and allows Dr. Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer, to focus on our business strategy and market opportunities, as well as on our organizational structure and execution capabilities. 
Risk Oversight 
The Board's role in risk oversight is consistent with our leadership structure, with our President and Chief Executive Officer and other members of management having responsibility for day-to-day risk management activities and processes, and our Board and its committees being actively involved in overseeing our risk management. The Board and management consider "risk" for these purposes to be the possibility of an undesired occurrence that could threaten the viability of the company, result in a material destruction of our assets or stockholder value, or materially impact our long-term performance. Examples of the types of risks faced by us include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• business-specific risks related to our ability to develop new products and services, our strategic position in key existing  and new markets, our operational execution and infrastructure, our relationships with our third-party manufacturing suppliers and competition in the microprocessor and graphics markets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• macroeconomic risks, such as adverse global economic conditions and global  geo-political events; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "event" risks, such as natural disasters and cybersecurity threats.  
[END TABLE]
We engage in activities that seek to take calculated risks that protect the value of our existing assets and create new or future value. Management is responsible for day-to-day risk management activities and processes. Members of senior management participate in identifying and assessing risks and risk controls, developing recommendations to determine the appropriate manner in which to control risk and implementing risk mitigation activities. Our Chief Executive Officer has ultimate responsibility for management of our business, including enterprise level risks and the risk management program and processes. 
In fulfilling its oversight role, the Board focuses on understanding the nature of our enterprise risks, including risks in our operations, finance and strategy, organization, compliance and external exposures as well as the adequacy of our risk assessment and risk management processes. The Board has implemented a risk oversight model and periodically receives reports and updates from management. At least annually, the Board discusses with management the appropriate level of risk relative to our strategy and objectives and reviews with management our existing risk management processes and their effectiveness. The Board also receives periodic management updates on our operations, organization, financial position and results and strategy and, as appropriate, discusses and provides feedback with respect to risks related to these topics. In addition, the Board receives full reports from the following Board committee chairs regarding each committee's considerations and actions related to the specific risk topics over which the committee has oversight: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board in overseeing our enterprise risk management process as it relates to our  financial and information technology (including security and cybersecurity) risk exposures; reviews our portfolio of risk; discusses with management significant financial, reporting, regulatory and legal compliance risks in conjunction with  enterprise risk exposures as well as risks associated with our capital structure; and reviews our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management and the actions management has taken to limit, monitor or control financial and enterprise  risk exposure. The Audit and Finance Committee meets with members of our Internal Audit department to discuss any issues that warrant attention.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee oversees risk management as it relates to our compensation policies and practices applicable to  all employees. It reviews with management whether our compensation programs may create incentives for our employees to take excessive or inappropriate risks which could be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. For additional  details, see "Compensation Policies and Practices," below. Additionally, the Compensation Committee oversees organizational risks, including leadership succession, talent capacity, capabilities, attraction, retention and culture.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers potential risks related to the effectiveness of the Board,  including succession planning for the Board and our overall governance and Board structure.

[END TABLE]
Code of Ethics 
The Board has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all directors and employees entitled the "Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct," which is designed to help directors and employees resolve ethical issues encountered in the business environment. The Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct covers topics such as conflicts of interest, compliance with laws (including anti-corruption laws), fair dealing, protecting our property and confidentiality of our information and encourages the reporting of any behavior not in accordance with the Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct. 
The Board has also adopted a "Code of Ethics" for our executive officers and all other senior finance executives. The Code of Ethics covers topics such as financial reporting, conflicts of interest and compliance with laws, rules, regulations and our policies.

Board Meetings and Attendance 
The Board held six meetings during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018, all members of the Board attended at least 75 percent of the meetings of the Board and Board committees on which they served. In addition, on at least an annual basis, the Board and management discuss our strategic direction, new business opportunities and product roadmap. Independent and non-management directors also meet regularly in scheduled executive sessions without our Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management. In addition to these formal meetings, members of our Board informally interact with senior management (including our Chief Executive Officer), industry leaders and customers on a periodic basis. In fiscal 2018, sessions of only our non-employee directors were held three times, and sessions of only our independent directors were held three times. 
Board Committees 
The Board has four standing committees: an Audit and Finance Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, a Compensation and Leadership Resources Committee and an Innovation and Technology Committee. The members of the Board committees and their Chairs are nominated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and appointed by the Board. 
Each of the Board committees has adopted a written charter, which has been approved by the Board. You can access our current bylaws, committee charters, the Governance Principles, the Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct and the Code of Ethics on the Investor Relations pages of our website at www.amd.com or ir.amd.com. 
Audit and Finance Committee.    The Audit and Finance Committee assists the Board with its oversight responsibilities regarding the integrity of our financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, risk assessment, the performance of our internal audit function, our financial affairs and policies and the nature and structure of major financial commitments. The Audit and Finance Committee is also directly responsible for the appointment, independence, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee meets alone with our senior management, our financial, legal and internal audit personnel and with our independent registered public accounting firm, which has free access to the Audit and Finance Committee. The head of our Internal Audit Department reports directly to the Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee and "dotted-line" to our Chief

Meetings and Committees of the Board of Directors (continued) 
 Financial Officer, and serves a staff function for the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee currently consists of Mr. Householder, as Chair, and Messrs. Caldwell, Inglis and Marren, each determined to be financially literate and "independent" under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules. The Board also determined that Mr. Householder is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined under applicable SEC rules. The Audit and Finance Committee held 10 meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its responsibilities regarding the identification of qualified candidates to become Board members, the selection of nominees for election as directors at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected), the selection of candidates to fill any vacancies on the Board and the development and recommendation to the Board of corporate governance guidelines and principles, including the Governance Principles. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Board's annual review of its performance (including its composition and organization) and leads a process for our non-employee directors to evaluate the performance of our Chief Executive Officer. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee retains a search firm for the purpose of obtaining information regarding potential candidates for Board membership. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee currently consists of Mr. Caldwell, as Chair, Ms. Denzel and Messrs. Durcan, Householder, Inglis, Marren and Talwalkar, each determined by the Board to be "independent" under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held five meetings during fiscal 2018 and one meeting during fiscal 2019 to consider director nominees for our Annual Meeting and other matters. 
In evaluating candidates to determine if they are qualified to become Board members, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee looks principally for the following attributes: personal and professional character, integrity, ethics and values; general business experience and leadership profile, including experience in corporate management, such as serving as an officer or former officer of a publicly held company; strategic planning abilities and experience; aptitude in accounting and finance; expertise in domestic and international markets; experience in our industry and with relevant social policy concerns; understanding of relevant technologies; expertise in an area of our operations; communication and interpersonal skills; and practical and mature business judgment. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers Board members' and nominees' service on the boards of other public companies. Although we do not have a formal diversity policy, to foster and maintain a diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds and experience on the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the mix of skills and experience of the directors and assesses nominees and potential candidates in the context of the current composition of the Board and our requirements, taking into consideration the diverse communities and geographies in which we operate. Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses these and other criteria to evaluate potential nominees, there are no stated minimum criteria for nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses the same standards to evaluate all director candidates, regardless of who proposes them. 
Compensation and Leadership Resources Committee.    The Compensation Committee assists the Board in its responsibilities relating to the compensation of all Section 16 officers, members of the Board and such other employees as delegated from time to time by the Board. In consultation with management, the Board and the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee designs, recommends to the Board for approval and evaluates employment, separation, Severance and Change and change of control agreements and our compensation plans, policies and strategies relating to talent management and development, including but not limited to those regarding talent acquisition, retention, talent development, succession planning, career progression, culture, diversity, and inclusion. With respect to our Section 16 officers, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves all grants to the Board, our executive officers, senior vice presidents, and Section 16 officers under our equity plans. To the extent permitted by its charter, the Compensation Committee may delegate certain authority and certain responsibilities to one or more of its members, our officers or a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee aims to structure our compensation program to encourage high performance, promote accountability and align employee interests with our strategic goals and with the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee also oversees risk management as it relates to our compensation policies and practices for employees generally. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc. ("Compensia"), a

[BEGIN TABLE]
• the compensation arrangements for our Board.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee is supported in its work by members of our management team—including Dr. Su, our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Senior Vice President Worldwide Marketing, Human Resources and Investor Relations, our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, and our Corporate Vice President, Compensation and Benefits. The Compensation Committee considers the input of these individuals to formulate the specific plan and award designs, including performance measures and performance levels, necessary to align our executive compensation program with our business objectives and strategies. These individuals did not attend either executive sessions or portions of any meetings of the Compensation Committee or our Board where their own compensation determinations were decided. Dr. Su does not participate in the determination of her own compensation. 
The Compensation Committee currently consists of Ms. Denzel, as Chair, and Messrs. Durcan and Talwalkar, each determined to be "independent" under applicable SEC and Nasdaq rules. The Compensation Committee held six meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Innovation and Technology Committee.    The Innovation and Technology Committee assists the Board in its oversight responsibilities regarding matters of innovation and technology. The Innovation and Technology Committee is responsible for reviewing, evaluating and making recommendations to the Board regarding our major technology plans and strategies, including our research and development activities, as well as the technical and market risks associated with product development and investment; reviewing, evaluating and making recommendations regarding talent and skills of our workforce supporting our technology and research and development activities; monitoring the performance of our technology development in support of our overall business strategy; monitoring and evaluating existing and future trends in technology that may affect our strategic plans; and assessing our risk mitigation policies and procedures relating to products based on new technology or significant innovations to existing technology. The Innovation and Technology Committee currently consists of Mr. Inglis, as Chair, and Messrs. Durcan and Yahia. The Innovation and Technology Committee held four meetings during fiscal 2018.

(1)  Amounts represent annual retainers for service as directors, annual retainers for Board committee service and annual  retainers for serving as Board committee chairs, where applicable. See "—Cash Fees Paid to Non-Employee Directors" below for additional information.  
(2)  Amounts represent equity awards in the form of restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards granted under our Outside  Director Equity Compensation Policy. See "—Equity Awards for Non-Employee Directors" below for additional information. Amounts reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of the respective  director's RSU awards computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("ASC Topic 718"). For a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuations  reflected in this column, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The actual value that a director may realize from an RSU award is contingent upon the  satisfaction of the conditions to vesting of that award. Thus, there is no assurance that the value, if any, eventually realized by the director will correspond to the amounts shown.

Determining Non-Employee Director Compensation.  The Compensation Committee annually reviews our non-employee directors' compensation. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee recommends any changes to our non-employee directors' compensation to the Board for approval. In addition, the Board and Compensation Committee periodically evaluate how our director pay levels and pay policies compare to the competitive market. In fiscal 2018, the Board and Compensation Committee reviewed competitive market data regarding non-employee directors' pay relative to our peer group (as described in more detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section) as well as the broader market which was compiled by Compensia. While competitive market data is important to the evaluation of the directors' compensation, such data is just one of several factors considered by the Board in approving director compensation, and the Board has discretion in determining the nature and extent of its use. In fiscal 2018, in addition to the competitive market data, the Board considered the amount of time associated with Board and Board committee services as well as annual share usage under the 2004 Plan related to non-employee director compensation. 
The Board continued the practice adopted in May 2014, to reallocate the mix of cash and equity compensation paid to our non-employee directors, with the goal of maintaining total average compensation per non-employee director at approximately the same level as had been previously paid and maintaining an affordable annual share usage. These changes are further described under "Cash Fees Paid to Non-Employee Directors" and "Equity Awards for Non-Employee Directors," below. 
Cash Fees Paid to Non-Employee Directors.  The cash fees our non-employee directors were eligible to receive in fiscal 2018 was composed of the following elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual retainer for services as a director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual retainer for services on a Board committee; and

• Annual retainer for services as a Board committee chair.

Annual Retainer for Service as Director.  Non-employee directors are paid an annual retainer for their service as directors. In fiscal 2018, other than our Chairman of the Board, the non-employee directors were paid an annual retainer of $75,000. The annual retainer for the Chairman of the Board for a full year of service is 1.5 times the amount of the other Board members annual retainer, or $112,500.

Equity Awards for Non-Employee Directors.  In order to align the long-term interests of our directors with those of our stockholders, a portion of director compensation is provided in the form of equity. Non-employee directors participate in our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (as amended and restated, the "2004 Plan") and are entitled to receive equity awards under our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, subject to the terms of the 2004 Plan. Non-employee directors are generally eligible to receive an annual RSU award (an "Annual RSU Award") upon re-election at each annual meeting of stockholders, and, if a non-employee director is appointed to the Board on a date other than the date of an annual meeting of stockholders, such director is entitled to receive an initial RSU award on his or her appointment to the Board (an "Off-Cycle RSU Grant"). 
Annual RSU Awards.  Under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, which was amended in October 2017, the Annual RSU Award for each non-employee director (other than the Chairman of the Board) who has served on the Board for at least six months prior to an annual meeting of stockholders is calculated based on the following formula, with no discretionary component: the quotient of (i) $185,000 (the "Target Equity Value") divided by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-trading day period preceding and ending with the date of the respective RSU grant. In fiscal 2018, the Chairman of the Board received an Annual RSU Award with a Target Equity Value of $277,500. 
In addition, under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, if a non-employee director has served on the Board for less than six months prior to an annual meeting of stockholders, such director's Annual RSU Award is pro-rated based on the number of months of service before the respective annual meeting of stockholders. For purposes of the pro-rata calculation, service during any portion of a month counts as a full month of service. 
Off-Cycle Grants.  Under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, an Off-Cycle Grant is equal to the quotient of (i) $185,000 divided by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-trading day period preceding and ending with the date of the respective RSU grant. The Annual RSU Awards and the Off-Cycle RSU Grants vest on the one-year anniversary of their grant dates. 
In fiscal 2018, each of our directors, other than those who did not stand for re-election, received an Annual RSU Award under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy. 
Deferral.  Pursuant to our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, our non-employee directors may elect to defer the issuance of shares of our common stock that become issuable upon vesting of the RSUs granted pursuant to the 2004 Plan (and the recognition of taxable income associated with such RSUs) until such time as the director ceases to serve on our Board. A non-employee director can make this election by completing a Restricted Stock Unit Award Deferral Election Agreement before the scheduled date of an RSU grant. If a director makes this election, the issuance

Directors' Compensation and Benefits (continued) 
 of the common stock subject to the RSUs may not be accelerated or changed once the Election Agreement is submitted to us. Any common stock deferred under our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy is issued to the director, in one lump sum, within 30 days after his or her resignation from our Board. 
Acceleration of Vesting.  Pursuant to our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, in the event of our change of control, all of our non-employee directors' equity compensation awards will become fully vested. In addition, in the event of the termination of a non-employee director's service to the Board as a result of death, disability or retirement, all of his or her equity compensation awards will become fully vested, provided that such non-employee director served as a member of the Board for at least three years prior to the date of termination and satisfied our stock ownership guideline requirements during his or her service as a Board member. 
Other Benefits for Non-Employee Directors.  We reimburse our directors for their travel and expenses in connection with attending Board meetings and Board-related activities, such as AMD site visits and sponsored events, as well as for continuing education programs. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines.  Under our stock ownership guidelines, which were updated in August 2017, our non-employee directors are required to hold the lesser of (i) the number of shares equivalent to five times their then-current annual retainer divided by the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-day period immediately preceding and ending with the date of the annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) 30,000 shares (in the case of non-employee directors other than the Chairman of our Board) or 45,000 shares (in the case of the Chairman of the Board). 
The stock ownership guidelines must be achieved by each non-employee director within the later of (i) August 2022, which is the five-year anniversary of the adoption of our amended stock ownership guidelines, or (ii) the five-year anniversary of the respective director's first election or appointment to the Board or first appointment as Chairman of the Board, as applicable. 
Until the requirements of our stock ownership guidelines are achieved, each non-employee director is encouraged to retain at least 10% of the "net shares" (as defined below) obtained through our stock incentive plans. Shares counted toward the minimum stock ownership requirements include (i) shares of common stock owned outright by a director and his or her immediate family members who share the same household, whether held individually or jointly; (ii) restricted stock where the restrictions have lapsed; (iii) shares acquired upon stock option exercise; (iv) shares purchased in the open market; (v) restricted stock units where the restrictions have lapsed but the issuance of the shares to the director has been deferred at the election of the director pursuant to a Company policy, plan or written agreement; and (vi) shares held in trust. "Net shares" are the number of shares from the sale of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock, less the number of shares the director sells to cover the exercise price of stock options and sells or has withheld to pay taxes. 
As of December 29, 2018, all of our non-employee directors were holding the required number of shares under our stock ownership guidelines or had time remaining to do so within the established compliance time frame.

In addition, we launched our first 7nm GPU products for the datacenter in fiscal 2018 and grew our server business exiting 2018 with mid-single digit unit share. 
We improved our financial results in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 as we grew annual revenue by more than $1.2 billion and recorded our highest profitability in seven years. In fiscal 2018, we grew revenue by 23% year-over-year to $6.5 billion, increased our operating income to $451 million compared to $127 million for fiscal 2017 and improved our net income to $337 million from a net loss of $33 million in the prior year. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were down slightly year over year to $1.16 billion from $1.18 billion as was our principal amount of total debt at $1.53 billion as of December 29, 2018 compared to $1.70 billion at the end of fiscal 2017.

In addition, we were the highest performing stock in the S&P 500 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index in 2018. From the end of fiscal 2015 to the end of fiscal 2018, we saw our market capitalization appreciate to create approximately $15.6 billion in value for our stockholders. The following graphic compares the change in our market capitalization to the change in the S&P 500 and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index ("SOX") from the end of fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018: 
Key Features of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program 
Our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program continued to reflect our longstanding practice of compensating our Named Executive Officers based on performance that aligns with and drives stockholder value. Also keeping with our historical compensation practice, our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program was structured to advance our business strategy and objectives, align with the interests of our stockholders and competitive practice, and promote sound corporate governance. 
The key features of our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Redesigned Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit ("PRSU") Awards.  We redesigned  the PRSUs granted to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2018 to provide that the PRSUs pay out based primarily on our stock price performance for the three-year performance period beginning August 9, 2018, and ending August 9, 2021, as  compared to the performance of the S&P 500 Index (which is generally considered to be representative of overall U.S. equity market performance) over the same period. In addition, payouts under the 2018 PRSUs are subject to (a) a positive  performance multiplier of 125% or 150% if we meet or exceed challenging pre-defined non-GAAP earnings per share ("EPS") growth targets for our 2018 through  2020 fiscal years, (b) a negative performance multiplier (in the form of a 50% reduction in payout) if our absolute stock price return over the performance period is negative, and (c) an award cap that limits the total dollar value payable  (in shares) to the Named Executive Officers. Unlike the 2018 PRSUs, the 2017 PRSUs did not have an EPS growth multiplier and payouts were based primarily on our total shareholder return ("TSR") as ranked against the TSRs of each of the  companies in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (which is comprised of 30 companies only in the semiconductor industry). We believe the redesigned 2018 PRSUs align with our business objectives and the interests of our stockholders by  focusing our Named Executive Officers on long-term earnings growth and sustainable stockholder returns relative to the broader U.S. equity market and comparing to a more representative set of public technology companies. Further discussion of the  design of our 2018 PRSUs is provided below on page 45 under "Fiscal 2018 Compensation Elements—Long-Term Equity Awards."

• Pay for Performance.  As illustrated in the tables below, the fiscal 2018 target total direct  compensation (defined below) delivered to our Named Executive Officers was heavily weighted towards performance-based compensation:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 91% of our Chief Executive Officer's target total direct compensation and 83% of the average target total direct  compensation of our other Named Executive Officers was delivered in the form of variable or "at risk" compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term equity awards (the ultimate value of which depend on our stock price) continued to be the largest element of  compensation, representing approximately 78% of our Chief Executive Officer's target total direct compensation and 65% of the average target total direct compensation of our other Named Executive Officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 100% of the fiscal 2018 target annual incentive bonuses payable to our Named Executive Officers was tied to the achievement  of pre-established annual financial and operational goals, which are aligned to our short-term and long-term objectives, as reflected in our annual operating plan.  
[END TABLE]
As used in this Proxy Statement, a Named Executive Officer's fiscal 2018 "target total direct compensation" is the sum of his or her fiscal 2018 base salary, target annual incentive bonus under our Executive Incentive Plan ("EIP"), and the aggregate intended target value of the long-term equity awards granted under our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") (the accounting values (grant date fair value) of our long-term equity awards differ and are included in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018" table below on page 58). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alignment with Stockholders.  Our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program reinforced the  alignment of interests between our Named Executive Officers and the long-term interests of our stockholders. Long-term equity awards represented the largest component of each Named Executive Officer's fiscal 2018 target total direct  compensation. Approximately 50% of the target value of each Named Executive Officer's fiscal 2018 long-term equity award was in the form of PRSUs, the potential payouts of which are tied to the performance measures described above. The  remaining 50% of the target value of each Named Executive Officer's fiscal 2018 long-term equity award was made in the form of stock options (25% of award target value) and time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") (25% of award  target value). The stock options and RSUs vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Further discussion of the design of our 2018 long-term equity awards is provided below on page 45 under  "Fiscal 2018 Compensation Elements—Long-Term Equity Awards."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market Competitive Compensation.  Each Named Executive Officer's fiscal 2018  target total direct compensation was generally set at competitive levels with compensation for executives in similar positions within our peer group, which our Compensation Committee believes reflects the current competitive market for executive  talent. Our Compensation Committee also considers a number of other factors, such as job performance, retention considerations and business conditions, which are more fully described below.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Fiscal 2018 Realized Pay 
The total pay of our Named Executive Officers, as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, reflects the accounting (grant date fair value) value of their annual long-term equity awards and not the economic value actually realized by our Named Executive Officers from these awards. Since a significant portion of the reported compensation of our Named Executive Officers represents potential future compensation, we believe it is useful to supplement the information provided in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table with a discussion of the pay our Named Executive Officers actually realized during the fiscal year. 
As in previous years, the key drivers of the realized pay of our Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2018 were (i) the increase in our stock price and (ii) our actual performance against the pre-established financial targets and operating goals under the EIP. 
The table below compares our market capitalization to the "realized pay" of our Chief Executive Officer and the average "realized pay" of our other Named Executive Officers for each of our last three fiscal years. As this table demonstrates, the compensation collectively "realized" by our Named Executive Officers in the aggregate from the end of fiscal year 2015 to the end of fiscal year 2018 represented 0.81% of the $15.6 billion in value created for our stockholders during that same period. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Each Named Executive Officer's "realized pay" is, for the applicable fiscal year, the sum of his or her  earned base salary, actual EIP bonus, any discretionary or retention bonus amounts realized, other compensation, and W-2 income realized due to stock option exercises and the vesting of restricted stock units  and performance-based awards under our equity plans. Additional information is provided below in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 53 and the "Option Exercises and Stock Vested in 2018" on page 60. Realized pay is not  a substitute for total compensation. For more information on total compensation as calculated under SEC rules, see the notes accompanying the 2018 Summary Compensation Table below.  
(2)  The fiscal 2016 and 2017 averages of the Other Named Executive Officers exclude Mr. Wolin who was not a Named  Executive Officer during those years.  
(3)  The AMD Market Capitalization amounts are as of the last day of each applicable fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
The fiscal 2018 realized pay of our Named Executive Officers was primarily attributable to (i) the vesting of long-term equity awards that were granted in prior years and (ii) their fiscal 2018 annual incentive bonuses under the EIP. The fiscal 2018 EIP bonuses of 86.0% compares to a fiscal 2017 EIP payout of 77.6% and a fiscal 2016 EIP payout of 32.5%, resulting in an average payout under the EIP for the previous three fiscal years of 65.4%. For a discussion of the fiscal 2018 EIP, see "Fiscal 2018 Compensation Elements—Annual Incentive Bonuses" below.

Executive Compensation Policies and Practices 
We implement sound executive compensation policies and practices, including compensation-related corporate governance standards, consistent with our executive compensation philosophy. During fiscal 2018, we maintained the following executive compensation policies and practices, which we believe drive superior performance and prohibit or minimize behaviors that we believe do not serve our stockholders' long-term interests: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Recoupment (or "claw-back")  policy    Under our Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct, we expressly reserve the right to claw-back  incentive-based or other compensation (including equity-based compensation) paid to an employee (including any Named Executive Officer) in the event of an employee's direct involvement with fraud, misconduct or gross negligence which  contributes to an accounting restatement as a result of our material noncompliance with any financial reporting laws.   In addition, all equity awards granted to our Named Executive Officers after October 2015 include a  forfeiture-for-cause provision, which provides for potential claw-back of the equity award if the Named Executive Officer violates the  non-competition, non-solicitation, or confidentiality covenants in the equity award agreement, or fails to comply with any agreement with us regarding inventions,  intellectual property rights, or proprietary information or material.

 One-year minimum vesting period for  equity awards    Our 2004 Plan requires a minimum one-year vesting period for all  awards granted after April 29, 2015, subject to limited exceptions such as death, disability, termination of employment or a change in control.   
 Cap on change in control payments and  benefits    Since March 2010, we have not and will not enter into any change in control agreement or arrangement with  a Named Executive Officer that provides for cash severance payments in excess of (i) two times the sum of base salary and target annual incentive bonus plus (ii) the prorated target annual incentive bonus for the year in which the  termination of employment occurs. Further, these payments will only be made if there is a termination of employment following a change in control or constructive discharge, as described in the "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements"  section.

Further, these payments will only be made if there is a termination of employment following a change in control or constructive discharge, as described in the "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements"  section.   
 No new excise tax gross-ups    Since April 2009, we have not and will not enter into any change in control agreement or arrangement with  a Named Executive Officer that provides for an excise tax gross-up payment.   
 Limited perquisites    We provide limited perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named Executive Officers and provide air  and other travel for our Named Executive Officers for business purposes only.   
 Limited perquisites    We provide limited perquisites or other personal benefits to our Named Executive Officers and provide air  and other travel for our Named Executive Officers for business purposes only.   
 Anti-hedging and pledging  policy    Our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, and our Directors are not permitted to hedge their  economic exposure to our equity securities. Our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, and our Directors are not permitted to pledge our equity securities without the preapproval of the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board  which is only expected to be granted in very limited circumstances. None of our Named Executive Officers or Directors currently have pledged any shares.   
 Incentive compensation  amounts are subject to payment thresholds and maximums    Our annual cash performance bonuses and the 2018 PRSUs have threshold performance requirements that must  be achieved to receive payment and are subject to maximum payment "caps."

 Stock ownership  requirements    Our stock ownership requirements provide that our Chief Executive Officer should attain an investment  position in our common stock having a value that is equal to the lesser of (a) the number of shares equal to five times her base salary or (b) 350,000 shares. Our other Named Executive Officers should attain an investment position in our common  stock having a value that is equal to the lesser of (x) the number of shares equal to two times their base salaries or (y) 80,000 shares.

 Independent compensation consultant    Pursuant to its Charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to  assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, a national compensation consulting firm, as its compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee on its decisions regarding  the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, and to keep the Compensation Committee apprised of compensation trends and best practices. Compensia performs no other services for us.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee seeks to align the objectives of our executive compensation program with the interests of our stockholders. In that respect, when evaluating our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee carefully considers both the results of our annual advisory resolution on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (the "say on pay" proposal) as well as direct feedback from our stockholders. At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, our "say on pay" proposal received support from approximately 95% of the votes cast on the proposal, reflecting overwhelming stockholder support for our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program. As we evaluated our compensation practices for 2018, we were mindful of the strong support our stockholders expressed for our program and ultimately decided to retain our general approach to the design of our executive compensation program. 
During fiscal 2018, we continued our practice of proactive stockholder engagement regarding executive compensation and other corporate governance. The Company does not rely on proxy season as its active stockholder engagement season and instead prefers to actively and directly engage with stockholders throughout the fiscal year. After filing and disseminating our definitive proxy statement for our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, we conducted conference calls, in-person meetings, or other discussions with several of our top 50 stockholders (which collectively represent approximately 53% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote at our annual meeting) to solicit feedback on the Company, including their views on our executive compensation structure and pay policies and practices. In the aggregate, feedback received during these discussions was generally supportive of our executive compensation program and our compensation plan design. In fiscal 2018 the Company also conducted an in-depth investor perception study where investor feedback and perceptions on many corporate topics was solicited. The Compensation Committee continues to encourage an active and meaningful dialogue with our stockholders regarding our executive compensation and governance practices. 
Talent Management Focus 
Developing, motivating, retaining and attracting talent is critical to guide and execute our strategy as well as to continue to grow our business. This is a strong focus of our executive compensation program and the Compensation Committee. Our executive compensation program aligns with our talent objectives and our compensation decisions not only consider individual and Company performance, but also long-term potential, key retention needs and organizational succession plans. 
One of the Compensation Committee's responsibilities described in its charter is to regularly review succession planning and talent development. The Compensation Committee at least annually reviews succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executive positions. These reviews occur with input from the Chief Executive Officer and our Senior Vice President, Worldwide Marketing, Human Resources and Investor Relations. The Compensation Committee also reviews succession plans in executive session, with no members of management present. Succession planning for key executive roles consists of an assessment of internal candidates and their development plans, as well as potential external talent with considerations for alignment with AMD's values for culture, diversity, and inclusion.

[END TABLE]
We continually assess and adjust our executive compensation program, policies and practices in light of these guiding principles and based on feedback obtained through our stockholder engagement efforts. 
Pay for Performance 
Our compensation philosophy centers on pay for performance and is driven by the following primary principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation practices should be designed to align with the interests of our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sustained, improved financial performance should result in increasing company valuation and stock price.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With improved company performance and increases in company valuation and stock price, our compensation programs should  deliver higher rewards to our Named Executive Officers.  
[END TABLE]
Competitive Compensation 
We operate in a highly competitive business environment, therefore it is imperative that we recruit and retain top leadership and industry experts to guide and execute our business strategy. To do so requires that we offer competitive compensation. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee seeks to compensate our Named Executive Officers at competitive levels with compensation for executives in similar positions at a group of peer companies (set forth below), which the Compensation Committee believes reflects the current competitive market for executive talent. In making its compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee also considers a number of other factors, including the scope of responsibility of each Named Executive Officer, internal pay comparisons, and the in-the-money value (i.e., retention value) of each Named Executive Officer's unvested long-term equity award holdings, as well as its assessment of each Named Executive Officer's performance and expected future impact on the organization. 
Generally, the Compensation Committee seeks to position each Named Executive Officer's target total direct compensation between the 50th and 75th percentile of the competitive market (the "Target Positioning"). A Named Executive Officer's target total direct compensation may vary from the Targeting Positioning depending on the other factors discussed above. The compensation realized by the Named Executive Officer will reach the Target Positioning only if applicable performance targets are achieved and our stock price matches index performance and does not decline. However, if performance targets are exceeded and our TSR surpasses the benchmark index, then the compensation realized by the Named Executive Officer could be substantially greater than the Target Positioning. For 2018, the actual total target direct compensation was generally consistent with our Target Positioning and the realized compensation was higher because of Company and stock price performance.

Align Pay Practices with Sound Risk Management 
The Compensation Committee seeks to structure our executive compensation program to motivate and reward our Named Executive Officers for appropriately balancing opportunity and risk, such as investment in key initiatives designed to advance our growth in existing and new markets while at the same time avoiding pay practices that encourage excessive risk-taking. 
The Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program fosters our objectives while mitigating potentially excessive risk-taking through the following means:

How We Make Compensation Decisions 
Role of the Compensation Committee and our Board 
The Compensation Committee is responsible to our Board for developing and overseeing our executive compensation and benefits policies and programs. The Compensation Committee, which consists of three independent directors, is responsible for reviewing our executive compensation program annually to evaluate its alignment with the strategies and needs of our business, market trends and the interests of our stockholders. The Compensation Committee is responsible for formulating compensation recommendations to the non-management members of our Board regarding our Chief Executive Officer's compensation and for approving the compensation of our other Named Executive Officers. This includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and approving the performance goals and objectives that relate to performance-based compensation awarded under  the EIP and the 2004 Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• conducting an annual compensation risk assessment to evaluate our compensation policies and practices;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• evaluating the competitiveness of each Named Executive Officer's total compensation package; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and approving any changes to a Named Executive Officer's total compensation package, including, but not  limited to, base salary, annual incentive bonus opportunities, annual long-term incentive award opportunities, and payouts and retention programs.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee is supported in its work by members of our management team—including our Chief Executive Officer, our Senior Vice President, Worldwide Marketing, Human Resources and Investor Relations, our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary and our Corporate Vice President, Compensation and Benefits. The Compensation Committee considers the input of these individuals to formulate the specific plan and award designs, including performance measures and performance levels, necessary to align our executive compensation program with our business objectives and strategies. These individuals did not attend either executive sessions or portions of any meetings of the Compensation Committee or our Board where their own compensation determinations were made. 
The non-management members of our Board annually conduct a performance assessment of our Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee reviews and considers our Board's performance assessment in making its recommendations to the non-management members of our Board regarding the compensation and other terms of our Chief Executive Officer's employment. Our Chief Executive Officer does not participate in the determination of her own compensation and no management recommendation is made regarding her compensation.

Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Compensia, a national compensation consulting firm, as its compensation consultant to provide assistance on executive and director compensation matters. Compensia advised the Compensation Committee on a variety of compensation-related matters in fiscal 2018, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the competitiveness of our executive compensation program by providing a market review of executive compensation,  evaluating our compensation peer group composition and analyzing the compensation at our compensation peer group companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the pay levels of our Named Executive Officers by assessing and advising on equity and cash compensation guidelines for  various executive job levels and assessing compensation levels for our executive officers;  
[END TABLE]

• our executive compensation program design, including short-term and long-term incentive plan design and pay mix, the  framework for our long-term equity awards and our retention strategies, evaluation of our stock ownership guidelines, and assessment of severance and change of control arrangements; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the compensation arrangements for the non-management members of our Board.   
[END TABLE]
Conflict of Interest Assessment for Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of receiving objective advice from its compensation consultant and, to that end, conducts an annual conflicts of interest assessment of its compensation consultant. In fiscal 2018, Compensia did not provide any services to or receive any payments from us, except in its capacity as a consultant to the Compensation Committee. In March 2019, the Compensation Committee considered whether the services provided by Compensia raised any conflicts of interest pursuant to the rules of the SEC and the listing rules of Nasdaq and concluded that the work performed by Compensia did not raise any conflicts of interest. 
In the course of its engagement, Compensia attended all meetings of the Compensation Committee and, where applicable, presented its findings and recommendations for discussion. Compensia also consulted frequently with members of the Compensation Committee and met with members of senior management to obtain and validate market data, review materials, and discuss management's compensation recommendations. 
Role of the Chief Executive Officer 
Generally, during the Compensation Committee's annual review of executive compensation, our Chief Executive Officer reviews with the Compensation Committee her performance evaluations of each of our other Named Executive Officers and her compensation recommendations for those Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee considers these recommendations in its decision process. 
Competitive Pay Analysis 
Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews the compensation decisions of a custom group of peer companies, in combination with industry-specific compensation survey data, to develop an understanding of the "competitive market" with respect to current executive compensation levels and related policies and practices. The Compensation Committee then evaluates how our pay practices and our Named Executive Officers' compensation levels compared to the competitive market. As part of this evaluation, the Compensation Committee also reviews the performance measures and related performance target levels generally used within the competitive market to reward performance. The Compensation Committee believes that it appropriately sets the compensation of our Named Executive Officers taking into account the practices of our peers and industry best practices. 
Methodology Used to Perform the Competitive Pay Analysis 
In preparation for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee requested that Compensia provide a competitive pay analysis for each Named Executive Officer using compensation data developed from (i) publicly available information (as of October 2017) of the companies included in a custom peer group (the "2018 Custom Peer Group") and (ii) compensation data for a special peer data cut of the Radford Global Technology Survey (which includes all companies noted below in the 2018 Custom Peer Group who participate in the survey).

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
To develop the 2018 Custom Peer Group, in October 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed the group of companies comprising the then-existing compensation peer group, with particular reference to their industry (i.e., business segment), revenues (generally 50% to 200% of our revenues for the trailing four fiscal quarters) and market capitalization (generally 30% to 300% our market capitalization), in each case based on publicly available information as of October 2017. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee removed Amkor Technology, Inc. and Sanmina Corporation from the peer group because their market capitalizations were less than 30% our market capitalization. Also based on this review, and in order to improve the statistical sampling of the peer group, the Compensation Committee added Analog Devices, Inc., Microchip Technology Incorporated, and Seagate Technology plc., each of which fit within the applicable criteria for industry, revenues and market capitalization. Our revenues for the trailing four fiscal quarters ending December 29, 2017, would have placed us in approximately the 51st percentile of the 2018 Custom Peer Group based on publicly available information. The Compensation Committee believes that the composition of the 2018 Custom Peer Group reflects an appropriate set of comparator companies for purposes of assessing our executive compensation program. 
The Compensation Committee used the 2018 Custom Peer Group competitive pay analysis developed by Compensia as its reference source in analyzing the competitiveness of our Named Executive Officers' compensation. As compared to the 2018 Custom Peer Group, AMD's fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 annual revenue was approximately $6.478 billion and $5.329 billion, respectively.

Base Salaries 
The annual base salaries of our Named Executive Officers as of the beginning and end of fiscal 2018 are set forth in the table below. Effective July 1, 2018, (a) the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved a salary increase for Dr. Su, and (b) the Compensation Committee approved increases to the base salaries of each of the other Named Executive Officers. These increases were in recognition of their past and expected future contributions to us, and improved the competitive positioning of their base salaries relative to the base salaries of the individuals holding comparable positions at the companies in the 2018 Custom Peer Group.

Annual Cash Performance Bonuses 
Generally, short-term incentives in the form of an annual cash performance bonus are provided to our Named Executive Officers under the EIP. These bonuses are designed to reward, where earned, short-term performance and the achievement of the principal goals of our annual operating plan. 
Under the EIP, the amount of each Named Executive Officer's annual incentive bonus is calculated based on (i) his or her target annual cash performance bonus opportunity and (ii) our corporate financial performance for the applicable performance period as measured against one or more pre-established performance levels. The financial measures and related performance levels for the performance period are approved by the Compensation Committee shortly after the commencement of the fiscal year. Bonuses earned under the EIP are paid in a single lump-sum amount after the end of the fiscal year. 
For fiscal 2018, each Named Executive Officer's annual cash performance bonus under the EIP was determined based on our financial performance during fiscal 2018. The following illustrates how the 2018 annual cash performance bonuses under the EIP were calculated: 
Base Salary Earned During 2018 Target Bonus Opportunity (150% of Base Salary for Chief Executive Officer and 100% of Base Salary for other Named Executive Officers)2018 EIP Performance Factor 0% to 200% (Based on AMDs Performance relative to Fiscal 2018 Financial Targets (as weighted ))

[END TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
The Compensation Committee used the following financial performance measures and weightings for fiscal 2018 to determine the amount of each Named Executive Officer's 2018 annual cash performance bonus under the EIP: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Adjusted  Non-GAAP Net Income     50%  
   Revenue     25%  
   Adjusted Free Cash Flow     25%  
[END TABLE]
The performance levels (threshold, target and maximum) for each financial performance measure were established by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of fiscal 2018, in each case in consultation with senior management. The performance levels were structured to align with our fiscal 2018 financial objectives taking into account overall affordability of the bonus opportunities provided under the EIP for fiscal 2018. 
The Compensation Committee chose adjusted non-GAAP net income as a performance measure because it is a fair measure of our profitability and a valid metric for comparison, which the Compensation Committee believes is directly tied to enhancedstock price performance. The Compensation Committee assigned it a weight of 50% because it is a key short-term financial measure for the operation of our business and is a measure of significant importance to our stockholders. For purposes of the 2018 EIP, our "adjusted non-GAAP net income" was calculated by adjusting our fiscal 2018 GAAP net income for non-GAAP financial adjustments and amounts accrued for the fiscal 2018 bonuses. 
The Compensation Committee chose revenue as a performance measure because it reflects our top-line growth, which the Compensation Committee believes is a strong indicator of our long-term ability to increase profitability, cash flow and improve stock price performance. For purposes of the 2018 EIP, our "revenue" was calculated as our GAAP net revenue for fiscal 2018. 
Finally, the Compensation Committee chose adjusted free cash flow as a performance measure because it believes effective cash management is a key component of our strategy and our annual operating plan, the successful execution of which should lower indebtedness, increase financial flexibility and ultimately drive improved company valuation and stock price performance. For purposes of the 2018 EIP, our "adjusted free cash flow" was calculated by adjusting our GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for (i) purchases of property and equipment and (ii) cash payments for fiscal 2017 employee bonuses under the EIP and our Annual Incentive Plan, which were paid in March and April 2018. 
The following table sets forth the fiscal 2018 performance levels and comparable actual results for the EIP:

[END TABLE]
The threshold, target and maximum performance levels for the 2018 EIP were determined by the Compensation Committee using our fiscal 2018 operating plan as a benchmark, and provide for appropriate payout above or below target. The fiscal 2018 EIP target level for each performance measure was determined by the Compensation Committee to be appropriately aggressive and aligned to our fiscal 2018 operating plan and objectives. The fiscal 2018 targets were set higher than the fiscal 2017 actual results. With respect to the adjusted non-GAAP net income and adjusted free cash flow performance measures, the level of performance required increases at an accelerating rate between each performance level. As a result, each incremental increase in potential payout under the 2018 EIP requires a slightly larger corresponding increase in our adjusted non-GAAP net income or adjusted free cash flow, as applicable. For the revenue performance measure, the level of performance required increases at a fixed rate between each performance level. Based on company performance against our fiscal 2018 financial targets, our EIP

Under the terms of the EIP, the Compensation Committee has discretion to reduce any Named Executive Officer's annual cash performance bonus prior to payment.

We believe that long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards provide a strong alignment between the interests of our Named Executive Officers and our stockholders. The Compensation Committee generally seeks to provide equity award opportunities that are consistent with our compensation philosophy (with the potential for larger payments for exceptional performance). The Compensation Committee also believes that long-term equity awards are an essential tool in promoting executive retention. 
In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee and, in Dr. Su's case, the non-management members of our Board, approved the following awards under our 2004 Plan:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
The aggregate intended target value was converted into a mix of 50% PRSUs, 25% RSUs and 25% stock options using a conversion price of $17.18 (the greater of $8.00 and the average closing price of our common stock over the 30 trading-day period ending on August 9, 2018, the 2018 annual program's grant date) and, for the stock options, also using a binomial factor of 41.38%. The amounts reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table represent the grant date fair values (i.e., accounting values) of the fiscal 2018 long-term equity awards computed in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718. 
2018 PRSU Awards.  The 2018 PRSUs provide for a payout that will range from 0% to 250% of the target number of shares of our common stock subject to the award (the "Target Shares"), provided that the maximum number of shares that may be earned is capped (the "Award Cap") at the number equal to (i) eight times the target value of the Named Executive Officer's PRSU award, divided by (ii) the closing price of our common stock on the last day of the three-year performance period ending on August 9, 2021, or the date of a change of control of the Company, if earlier (as applicable, the "Performance Period"). Even though the maximum payout for the 2018 PRSUs is 250%, depending on the closing price of our common stock (as determined above) the Award Cap may limit the amount below the maximum. The Award Cap serves to avoid excessive gains and control the accounting expense of the 2018 PRSU awards. Subject to the Award Cap, the actual number of shares earned by each Named Executive Officer will be calculated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each Named Executive Officer will earn between 0% and 200% of his or her target number of shares (the "Initial Earned  Shares") depending on the return on our stock price relative to the return on the S&P 500 Index, in each case over the Performance Period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In alignment with our long-term growth strategy, we added EPS growth as an upside modifier to the award. If we meet or  exceed challenging pre-defined non-GAAP EPS growth targets for our 2018 through 2020 fiscal years, award payouts will be increased to 125% or 150% of each Named  Executive Officer's Initial Earned Shares (if applicable, the "Adjusted Earned Shares"). In no event, however, will the Named Executive Officer's Adjusted Earned Shares exceed 250% of his or her target number of shares.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the return on our stock over the Performance Period is negative, then the total number of shares earned by each Named  Executive Officer will be reduced to 50% of his or her Adjusted Earned Shares. If the return on the Company's stock price over the Performance Period is equal to or greater than zero percent, then the total number of shares earned by each Named  Executive Officer will be the number of his or her Adjusted Earned Shares.  
[END TABLE]
Vested PRSUs will generally be settled on the later of August 16, 2021, or the date following the Compensation Committee's certification of performance. Each Named Executive Officer must be continuously employed through the last day of the Performance Period to receive his or her earned shares, except to the extent an event triggers accelerated vesting of the 2018 PRSUs under the terms of his or her employment or other agreement, as applicable. 
Stock Options.  Stock options are intended to align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with the interests of our stockholders because they will not realize any financial benefit from these awards unless our stock price increases above the exercise price over the seven-year option term. The stock options have an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date, which was $19.10 per share. The stock options vest (and become exercisable) as to 33 1/3% of the underlying shares on each of August 9, 2019, August 9, 2020 and August 9, 2021, subject to each Named Executive Officer's continued employment with us through each vesting date (unless his or her employment agreement or other agreement with us provides otherwise). The service-based vesting requirements are intended to further our retention objectives. The stock options expire seven years after the grant date, subject to earlier expiration if his or her employment with us terminates. 
RSUs.  RSUs are intended to encourage executive retention, manage share dilution, recognize individual performance and align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with our stockholders because the value of the awards is tied to the market value of our common stock at the time of vesting. All of the RSUs awarded to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2018 vest as to 33 1/3% of the underlying shares on each of August 9, 2019, August 9, 2020 and August 9, 2021, subject to each Named Executive Officer's continued employment with us through each vesting date (unless his or her employment agreement or other agreement with us provides otherwise).

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Aggregate Intended Target Value of Fiscal 2018 Annual Equity Award Grants.  In determining the aggregate intended target value of each Named Executive Officer's annual long-term equity award for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed data showing the market-competitive award levels based on the 2018 Custom Peer Group and the potential realizable value of each Named Executive Officer's existing equity holdings. Additionally, in approving the fiscal 2018 equity awards for our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee considered the potential realizable value of each Named Executive Officer's existing equity holdings, executive retention objectives and continuity within senior management and the following high-level corporate goals: achieve fiscal 2018 annual operating plan, execute industry leading roadmap and meet customer commitments. The achievement of these high-level goals drive our overall Company strategy and, subsequently, the attainment of the performance objectives in our long-term incentive compensation program. 
Accounting Considerations.  We follow ASC Topic 718 for our share-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, based on the grant date "fair value" of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our Named Executive Officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their share-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that a recipient is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award. 
In accordance with ASC Topic 718, the accounting value of the 2018 PRSUs was determined by an outside professional valuation consultant using a Monte-Carlo simulation model and based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the probability-weighted payoffs of a share-based payment assuming a variety of possible stock price paths and represents the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the requisite service period determined as of the grant date under ASC Topic 718, except no assumptions for forfeitures are included. 
Grant Timing Practices.  We have no practice or policy of coordinating or timing the release of company information around the grant date of our annual long-term equity awards. Our annual long-term equity awards are typically made in July or August. On occasion, we grant equity awards outside of our annual grant cycle for new hires, promotions, recognition, retention or other purposes. These "off cycle" grants are made only on a limited basis. 
See the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018" table below for more information on the equity awards that we granted to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2018. 
Deferred Compensation 
In fiscal 2018, our Named Executive Officers were eligible to participate in our Deferred Income Account Plan (the "DIA Plan"). Participation in the DIA Plan is intended to assist our Named Executive Officers in their retirement planning as well as to restore Company contributions that are lost due to IRS limits applicable to contributions in our Section 401(k) plan. The Compensation Committee believes the opportunity to defer compensation is a competitive benefit that enhances our ability to attract and retain talented executives while building plan participants' long-term commitment to the Company. 
For further information about the DIA Plan, see the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table below. 
Health, Welfare and Other Personal Benefits (Perquisites) 
In fiscal 2018, a broad population of our U.S. employees, including our Named Executive Officers, were eligible to receive the following health, welfare, perquisites and other personal benefits: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• participation in our U.S. benefit programs, including our Section 401(k) plan, health care coverage, paid time-off and paid holidays;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• matching contributions under our Section 401(k) plan, which were equal to 75% of an employee's annual  contribution, up to the first 6% of compensation deferred under the plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• patent awards, if earned.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the above, our Named Executive Officers were eligible to receive an annual physical examination and executive life insurance.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
The health, welfare and other personal benefits described above are intended to be part of a competitive overall compensation program and help attract and retain executive talent. 
For further information regarding the health, welfare and other personal benefits received by our Named Executive Officers during fiscal 2018, see the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Change in Control Agreements and Other Change in Control Arrangements 
Our Chief Executive Officer has an employment agreement, effective October 8, 2014, approved by our Board that establishes her base salary and provides for annual incentive and long-term incentive awards under our approved plans (i.e., the EIP and 2004 Plan). In addition, the agreement provides for certain payments and benefits in the event of certain termination of employment scenarios, including following a change in control of the Company. For further information on this agreement, see the "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements" section beginning on page 60. 
Each of our other Named Executive Officers is party to a change in control agreement (or, in Mr. Wolin's case, a management continuity agreement) with us. These agreements and the change-in-control provisions of Dr. Su's employment agreement are designed to encourage the continued services of the covered Named Executive Officer in the event of a potential change in control of the Company and to allow for a smooth leadership transition upon such a change in control. In addition, these agreements and the change-in-control provisions in Dr. Su's employment agreement are intended to provide incentives to the covered Named Executive Officer to effectively execute the directives of our Board, even in the event that such actions may result in the elimination of the Named Executive Officer's position. 
In April 2009, AMD adopted a policy to not enter into any new management continuity agreements or change in control agreements containing an excise tax gross-up provision. Our Named Executive Officers' change in control agreements do not provide for excise tax gross-ups except for Mr. Wolin's management continuity agreement, which was entered into prior to April 2009 and has not been amended since that time. 
Termination of Employment Required to Trigger Payments 
Under the terms and conditions of these arrangements and agreements, each of our Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive certain specified payments and benefits only if (i) a "change in control" of us occurs and (ii) the Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated or the Named Executive Officer is constructively discharged within two years of the change in control transaction (a "double trigger" arrangement). The Compensation Committee believes this structure strikes a balance between our incentive arrangements and our executive hiring and retention objectives without providing "windfall" payments and benefits to any Named Executive Officers who continue employment with an acquiring entity following a change in control of the Company. 
For a detailed description of these arrangements and agreements with our Named Executive Officers, as well as an estimate of the amounts payable under such arrangements as of the last day of fiscal 2018, see "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements" on page 60 below. 
Severance and Separation Arrangements 
Any post-employment compensation payable to our Chief Executive Officer is governed solely by her employment agreement, the terms of which were the result of arms-length negotiations between her and the Compensation Committee. Under her employment agreement, our Chief Executive Officer is eligible to receive certain specified payments and benefits in the event that her employment is involuntarily terminated. The Compensation Committee believes that the amount payable to our Chief Executive Officer pursuant to her employment agreement is reasonable and competitive and provides transition assistance in the event of her involuntary termination of employment, with the goal of keeping her focused on our business rather than her personal circumstances. 
With the exception of our Chief Executive Officer, all of our other Named Executive Officers participate in our Executive Severance Plan for Senior Vice Presidents (the "SVP Severance Plan"). The SVP Severance Plan is designed to provide uniform treatment in the event of an involuntary termination of employment of our U.S. senior executives (except our Chief Executive Officer) and to provide transition assistance in such instances with the goal of keeping these senior executives focused on our business rather than their personal circumstances. A Named Executive Officer is

 not eligible to receive payments and benefits under the SVP Severance Plan if he or she receives severance payments and benefits in connection with a change in control of the Company pursuant to his or her change in control agreement. The Compensation Committee believes that the SVP Severance Plan provides the covered executives important protections and promotes our objectives of attracting and retaining executive talent. 
For a detailed description of the post-employment compensation arrangements of our Named Executive Officers, as well as an estimate of the amounts payable under such arrangements as of the last day of fiscal 2018, see "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements" on page 60 below. 
Other Compensation Policies 
Compensation Recoupment ("Claw-back") Policy 
Our Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct provide that we may pursue all remedies available under applicable law to recover any incentive-based or other compensation (including equity awards) paid or granted to our employees or agents if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of our material noncompliance with any financial reporting laws. 
In addition, the award agreement for each stock option, RSU, and PRSU granted since May 2010 to an employee at or above the level of senior vice president (which includes our Named Executive Officers) has included a compensation recoupment ("claw-back") provision. The claw-back provides the Compensation Committee with the right to recover all or a portion of the compensation attributable to the award if the employee's direct involvement with fraud, misconduct or his or her gross negligence contributes to or results in us being required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of our material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws. The claw-back does not apply to any award granted more than 18 months before the date of the first public issuance or SEC filing of the financial document embodying the reporting requirement. In addition, with respect to awards granted in and after August 2015, we may claw-back the award if the recipient violates the non-competition or non-solicitation terms of the award agreement as permitted under applicable law. The Compensation Committee may exercise these claw-back rights by cancellation, forfeiture, repayment or disgorgement of any profits realized by the employee from the sale of our securities. 
We continue to monitor the rulemaking activities of the SEC and Nasdaq with respect to the development, implementation and disclosure of compensation recovery provisions/policies. We expect to revise our compensation recovery provisions/policies in the future if and as required by applicable law. 
Stock Ownership Requirements 
Our stock ownership requirements are designed to increase our Named Executive Officers' stakes in us and to align their interests more closely with those of our stockholders. 
These requirements provide that on or before the Ownership Achievement Date (as defined below), our President and Chief Executive Officer should attain an investment position in our common stock equal to the lesser of (a) five-times her annual base salary or (b) 350,000 shares, and our other Named Executive Officers should attain an investment position in our common stock equal to the lesser of (x) two-times their annual base salaries or (y) 80,000 shares. 
Shares of our common stock counted toward the minimum stock ownership requirements include any shares held directly or indirectly by a Named Executive Officer. 
The "Ownership Achievement Date" is the later of August 2, 2022, or five years from first appointment as an executive officer. In the case of an existing executive officer being appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, the "Ownership Achievement Date" is the later of August 2, 2020, or five years from the date of such appointment. Until the guideline is achieved, each Named Executive Officer is encouraged to retain at least 10% of the net shares (defined below) obtained through our stock incentive plans. For this purpose, the "net shares" are the number of shares received from the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards, less the number of shares the Named Executive Officer sells to cover the exercise price of stock options or sells or has withheld to pay taxes.

[END TABLE]
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
As of December 29, 2018, each of our Named Executive Officers had satisfied his or her applicable stock ownership requirement. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") generally disallows public companies a tax deduction for federal income tax purposes of remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to certain executive officers. While the Compensation Committee may consider the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining our executive compensation, it also considers other factors in making its executive compensation decisions and retains the flexibility to grant awards or pay compensation the Compensation Committee determines to be consistent with its goals for our executive compensation program, even if the awards may not be deductible for tax purposes. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act repealed the exception to the deductibility limit that was previously available for "qualified performance-based compensation" (including stock option grants, performance-based cash bonuses and performance-based equity awards, such as the PRSUs) effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. As a result, any compensation paid to certain of our Named Executive Officers for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 in excess of $1 million will be non-deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief afforded by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to compensation payable pursuant to certain binding arrangements in effect on November 2, 2017.

COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation policies and practices for employees generally and concluded that these policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. 
In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of management, assessed our executive and broad-based compensation and benefits programs to determine if any of them created undesired or excessive risks of a material nature. The assessment included (i) a review of our compensation policies and practices for employees generally, (ii) identification of the risks that could result from such policies and practices, (iii) identification of the risk mitigators and controls, and (iv) analysis of the potential risks against the risk mitigators and controls and our business strategy and objectives. Although the Compensation Committee reviewed all of our compensation programs, the Compensation Committee focused on the programs that have variability of payout and in which employees could directly affect the payout of incentives. These programs included the EIP, Annual Incentive Plan, Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTI"), Sales Incentive Plan and 2004 Plan. 
In performing the assessment and reaching its conclusion, the Compensation Committee noted the following factors that the Compensation Committee believes may reduce the likelihood of undesired or excessive risk-taking: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our overall compensation levels are competitive with the market;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation practices and policies appropriately balance base pay versus variable pay and short-term versus long-term  incentives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Although the EIP, Annual Incentive Plan, LTI and Sales Incentive Plan have variability of payout, the Compensation  Committee believes that any potential risks associated with such plans are controlled or mitigated by one or more of the following: (i) the performance goals being multi-dimensional (i.e., adjusted  non-GAAP net income, adjusted non-GAAP free cash flow, revenue), thereby increasing the range of performance over which incentives are paid, (ii) the performance  goals being aligned with our business objectives and being quantitative financial measures, (iii) the use of sliding payout scales, with the payouts in certain instances being linearly interpolated for performance falling between the  performance levels set by the Compensation Committee, (iv) the ability of the Compensation Committee and/or management to exercise discretion to reduce payouts, (v) the existence of multiple internal controls and approval processes that  are intended to prevent manipulation of outcomes by any employee, including the Named Executive Officers and (vi) the incentive opportunities being capped;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Although the grant of equity awards under the 2004 Plan could motivate our employees to, among other things, focus on  increasing our short-term stock price rather than the creation of long-term stockholder value, the Compensation Committee believes that potential risks are controlled or mitigated by one or more of the following: (i) awarding a combination of  PRSUs, RSUs and stock options, (ii) three-year vesting and performance period for PRSUs awarded in fiscal 2018, (iii) the vesting provisions of stock options and RSUs occurring over multi-year periods, (iv) caps on performance-based  compensation opportunities, and (v) our stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers. In addition, we prohibit our employees, including Named Executive Officers, from engaging in hedging transactions in our securities; and

(1)  Amounts represent the estimated cash performance bonuses payable under the EIP for fiscal 2018. For the Named Executive  Officers, the actual amounts paid under the EIP for fiscal 2018 are set forth in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" above.   
(2)  Amounts represent PRSUs. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Fiscal 2018 Compensation  Elements—Long-Term Equity Awards" above for more information about the PRSUs, including the pre-established performance periods and performance measures, and see footnotes to the "Outstanding  Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" table above for a description of the PRSU vesting schedules.  
(3)  Amounts represent time-based RSUs. See footnotes to the "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" table above for a description of the RSU vesting schedules.  
(4)  Amounts represent stock options. See footnotes to the "Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End" table above for a description of the stock option vesting schedules. The stock options expire seven years after the grant date.  
(5)  Amounts reflect the grant date fair value of the respective award computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Regardless of  the value on the grant date, the actual value that may be realized from an award is contingent upon the satisfaction of the applicable conditions to vesting of that award, and for stock options, also upon the excess of AMD's stock price over  the exercise price. With respect to the PRSUs, in accordance with SEC rules, amounts reflect the fair value at the grant date determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation model and based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of the probability-weighted  payoffs of a share-based payment assuming a variety of possible stock price paths and represents the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the requisite service period determined as of the grant date under ASC Topic 718. For  a discussion of the assumptions made in the valuation reflected in these amounts, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report.  
(6)  Mr. Anderson resigned effective September 3, 2018 and was not eligible to receive an annual cash performance  bonus under the EIP for fiscal 2018.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PAY RATIO 
For 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation for the median employee of the Company (other than our Chief Executive Officer) was $80,931;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer was  $13,356,392(1).  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of the median employee was 165 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
As permitted by SEC rules, to identify our median employee, we selected total estimated compensation which we calculated as annual base pay plus the estimated bonus for 2018 plus the grant value of stock awards, as the compensation measure to be used to compare the total compensation of our employees as of December 1, 2018. We annualized base pay and estimated bonus for any regular employees who commenced work during 2018 and did not annualize these amounts for temporary and seasonal employees. The annual total compensation of the median employee and the annual total compensation of the CEO were calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, and the median employee's annual total compensation was converted to U.S. dollars using a currency exchange rate as of December 31, 2018.

SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS 
We have entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Su, our current President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Messrs. Kumar, Norrod, Papermaster and Wolin participate in the SVP Severance Plan and have each entered into a change in control agreement with us (or, in Mr. Wolin's case, a management continuity agreement). Mr. Anderson did not receive any severance payments or benefits in connection with his resignation in September 2018. 
The SVP Severance Plan and change in control agreements and management continuity agreement are designed to (i) implement a uniform process for handling potential future involuntary departures of the Named Executive Officers, and (ii) encourage the Named Executive Officers' continued services in the event of a potential change in control of us and to allow for a smooth transition upon such a change in control. In addition, these arrangements are intended to provide incentives to the Named Executive Officers to effectively execute the directives of our Board, even in the event that such actions may result in the elimination of a Named Executive Officer's position. Under the terms of the change in control agreements and management continuity agreement, a Named Executive Officer is eligible to receive certain specified compensatory payments and benefits only if (i) a "change in control" occurs, and (ii) the Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated, or the Named Executive Officer is constructively discharged, within two years of that change in control. 
Dr. Su's Employment Agreement.    Pursuant to Dr. Su's at-will employment agreement (the "Su Employment Agreement"), setting forth Dr. Su's duties and obligations as our President and Chief Executive Officer, the Su Employment Agreement may be terminated by (i) us for Cause (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement), (ii) Dr. Su's Involuntary Termination Without Cause (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement), (iii) Dr. Su's Constructive Termination (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement), (iv) Dr. Su's voluntary election to terminate her employment with us, or (v) Dr. Su's death or disability. 
Except as otherwise described in the next paragraph, in the event of Dr. Su's Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination, subject to Dr. Su's execution of a full release of claims, which remains effective, following such termination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Dr. Su will be credited with an additional 12 months of service for purposes of calculating the service-based vesting  of any unvested equity awards granted to Dr. Su on or after October 8, 2014 and 24 months of service for purposes of calculating the service-based vesting of any unvested equity awards granted to Dr. Su before October 8, 2014.  Any performance-based equity award for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of the date of termination will continue in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement and will be earned or forfeited based on  actual performance for the applicable performance period. The settlement of any earned performance-based equity award will occur at such time as such performance-based equity award would have been settled had Dr. Su continued her employment  with us;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will make a lump-sum cash payment to Dr. Su in an amount equal to two times  her then base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay Dr. Su the pro-rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the  EIP, based on actual performance for the year of termination and paid at the time annual bonuses are paid to other executives; and

Severance and Change in Control Arrangements (continued) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will, for 24 months following the date of termination, pay Dr. Su an amount equal to the COBRA premium for  continuation coverage for herself and her dependents (if applicable) under our group medical and dental plans on a monthly basis.  
[END TABLE]
In the event of Dr. Su's Involuntary Termination Without Cause or Constructive Termination between the public announcement of a transaction that results in our Change of Control (as defined in the Su Employment Agreement) and 24 months after such Change of Control, subject to Dr. Su's execution of a full release of claims, which remains effective, following such termination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay Dr. Su her earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination and all other amounts to which  Dr. Su is entitled under any of our compensation plans or practices on the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All unvested equity awards then held by Dr. Su will accelerate and be deemed fully vested, and all performance-based  vesting conditions will be deemed achieved at the target levels set forth in the applicable award agreement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will make a lump-sum cash payment to Dr. Su in an amount equal to two times  her base salary plus two times her target annual bonus, in each case at the rate in effect immediately before the date of termination or, if higher, the rate in effect six months before the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will pay Dr. Su the pro-rata amount of her annual bonus accrued under the  EIP assuming performance at target levels for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will, for 24 months following the date of termination, pay Dr. Su an amount equal to the COBRA premium for  continuation coverage for herself and her dependents (if applicable) under our group medical and dental plans on a monthly basis. In addition, we will pay Dr. Su $4,000 per month for 12 months following the date of termination for financial  planning and tax planning services.  
[END TABLE]
Under the terms of the Su Employment Agreement, upon a termination of employment in connection with a change in control, Dr. Su's severance payments and benefits will be made in full or as to such lesser amount as would result in no portion of the payments being subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (relating to Section 280G of the Code), whichever of the foregoing amounts is greater on an after-tax basis (i.e., a parachute payment cut-back). 
Executive Severance Plan for Senior Vice Presidents.    With the exceptions of Dr. Su and Mr. Anderson, all of the Named Executive Officers participated in the SVP Severance Plan as of the end of fiscal 2018. 
Under the terms of the SVP Severance Plan, any participant who (i) is involuntarily terminated other than for cause (as defined in the SVP Severance Plan) or as a result of death or disability (as defined in the SVP Severance Plan) and (ii) is not offered a job with one of our affiliates or a successor of us, will be entitled to the following benefits, subject to the participant's execution of a full release of claims, which remains effective, following such termination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will make a lump-sum cash payment to the participant in an amount equal to 12  months of base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will, for 12 months following the date of termination, pay COBRA premiums for continuation coverage under our group  medical and dental plans; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We will allow participants to use our Employee Assistance Plan for up to 12 months.  
[END TABLE]
Additionally, we will seek reimbursement on a pro-rata basis, of severance benefits if we re-employ a participant during the 12 months following receipt of a severance payment under the SVP Severance Plan. 
The SVP Severance Plan is intended to represent the exclusive severance benefits payable to a participant by us. Accordingly, any Participant who is entitled to receive severance benefits payable in connection with a change of control pursuant to a change in control agreement may not also receive severance benefits under the SVP Severance Plan. In other words, a participant may not collect severance benefits under the SVP Severance Plan if he or she receives benefits under a change in control agreement with us. 
Although we expect to maintain the SVP Severance Plan indefinitely, we may amend, modify or terminate the SVP Severance Plan at any time. Therefore, severance benefits under the SVP Severance Plan are not guaranteed and may be eliminated in the future. Our SVP Severance Plan includes non-defamation and other administrative provisions.

Severance and Change in Control Arrangements (continued) 
Change in Control Agreements.    We entered into change in control agreements with Messrs. Kumar, Anderson, Norrod and Papermaster designed to encourage their continued services in the event of a change in control. For purposes of these change in control agreements, a change in control generally means any of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition by any person representing more than 50% of our then outstanding shares of stock or the combined voting  power of our voting securities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a change of the majority of the Board during any two consecutive years, unless certain Board approval conditions are met;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a merger or consolidation of us into any other corporation, where immediately after the merger or consolidation 50% or less  of the combined voting power is held by holders of our voting securities immediately before such merger or consolidation; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or there is a consummated a sale of all or substantially all of our  assets.  
[END TABLE]
The change in control agreements provide that, if within two years after a change in control, the Named Executive Officer's employment is terminated by us without cause or they are constructively discharged, the Named Executive Officer will receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum severance benefit equal to the sum of two times the executive's rate of annual base compensation at the  rate in effect immediately before the date of termination or, if higher, the rate in effect six months before the date of the change in control, plus two times the target annual bonus in the year of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all unvested equity will vest and be exercisable, and options may be exercised for the period of one year from the date of  termination or the original option term, whatever is shorter;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• payment of the executive's prorated accrued bonus assuming performance at target levels for the portion of the year  prior to the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reimbursement of personal financial and tax planning up to $4,000 for twelve months following the date of termination; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 12 months' continued health and welfare benefits comparable to those in effect at termination and a gross-up for any income taxes due as a result of the payment by us for such health and welfare benefits.  
[END TABLE]
The payments and benefits pursuant to the change in control agreements are subject to the executive's execution of a release of claims. Further, upon a termination of employment in connection with a change in control, the executive's severance payments and benefits will be made in full or as to such lesser amount as would result in no portion of the payments being subject to an excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (relating to Section 280G of the Code), whichever of the foregoing amounts is greater on an after-tax basis (i.e., a parachute payment cut-back). 
Management Continuity Agreement.     We entered into a management continuity agreement with Mr. Wolin in 2005 in order to encourage his continued service in the event of a change in control. For purposes of his management continuity agreement, a change in control includes any change of a nature that would be required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, a change in control shall be deemed to have occurred on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition by any person, other than us or any employee benefit plan of ours, of beneficial ownership of more than 20%  of the combined voting power of our then-outstanding securities; termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a change of the majority of the Board of Directors during any two consecutive years, unless certain conditions of Board  approval are met; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a determination by certain members of the Board of Directors within one year after an event that such event constitutes a  change in control.  
[END TABLE]
The management continuity agreement provides that, if within two years after a change in control Mr. Wolin's employment is terminated by us without cause or he is constructively discharged, he will receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a severance benefit equal to three times the sum of his rate of annual base compensation at the rate in effect immediately  before the date of termination or, if higher, the rate in effect six months before the date of the change in control, plus the average of his two highest bonuses in the last five years;

• payment of his prorated accrued bonus for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• 12 months' continued health and welfare comparable to those in effect on the date of termination and any income taxes  due as a result of the payment by us for such health and welfare benefits;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reimbursement of personal financial and tax planning up to $4,000 for 12 months following the date of termination; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all unvested equity will vest and be exercisable, and options may be exercised for the period of one year from the date of  termination or the original option exercise period, whatever is shorter.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the management continuity agreement, if benefits provided to Mr. Wolin are subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (relating to Section 280G of the Code), then we will pay to Mr. Wolin an amount necessary to place him in the same after-tax position as he would have been in had no excise tax or penalty been imposed. 
AMD Policies.    In April 2009, we adopted a policy to, in general, not enter into any new change in control agreements or arrangements containing an excise tax gross-up provision. Dr. Su's change in control agreement does not provide for an excise tax gross-up. Mr. Wolin's management continuity agreement provides for an excise tax gross-up, but it was entered into before April 2009 and has not been amended since that time. 
In March 2010, we also adopted a policy to not enter into any new change in control agreement or arrangement with any executive officer that provides for a cash severance payment (upon both our change in control and a subsequent termination of employment) in excess of (i) two times the sum of the respective executive officer's base salary and annual target bonus, plus (ii) a prorated annual target bonus for the year in which the termination of employment occurs. Dr. Su's change in control agreement complies with this limitation. Mr. Wolin's management continuity agreement provides for a greater severance payment, but it was entered into before March 2010 and has not been amended since that time. 
Vesting of Awards.    All RSUs and stock options granted under our equity incentive plans become fully vested (i) if our successor refuses to assume or substitute similar awards for outstanding awards, upon a change in control, or (ii) if our successor assumes or substitutes similar awards for outstanding awards and the participant's employment is terminated by our successor for any reason (other than for misconduct) or by the participant due to a constructive termination within one year following a change in control, upon such termination of employment. All PRSUs vest to the extent the applicable performance criteria were achieved or on the date of the change in control. Upon death or disability, the participant or the participant's estate shall have the right for a period of twelve (12) months following the date of death or termination of status as a service provider to exercise any stock options to the extent the participant was entitled to exercise such stock options on the date of death or termination. 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.    The following table presents the amount of compensation and benefits payable to Dr. Su under her employment agreement in the event of (i) an involuntary termination without cause or a constructive termination (without a change in control), (ii) an involuntary termination without cause or a constructive termination in connection with a change in control and (iii) a separation due to death. As required by SEC rules, the amounts shown assume that the termination or death was effective as of December 29, 2018, exclude amounts earned through that time and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to Dr. Su. For purposes of the below calculations, the value of each share of our common stock underlying an option, RSU or PRSU is assumed to be $17.82, the last reported sales price of our common stock on December 28, 2018, the last trading day of fiscal 2018.

(8)  Amount reflects the value of all unvested RSUs and PRSUs. The number of PRSUs payable reflects deemed achievement at  target levels. Amounts shown also reflect the value of award acceleration in the event of a change in control if the successor refuses to assume or substitute similar awards for outstanding RSUs and PRSUs, pursuant to our equity incentive plans.   
(9)  Amount represents our cost of paying COBRA premiums on behalf of Dr. Su and her dependents for 24 months following  her termination based on rates for a current employee.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Under the SVP Severance Plan, the value of the severance benefit following an involuntary termination or separation due to  death or disability is equal to a single lump sum severance payment equivalent to 12 months of base pay.  
(2)  Under the change in control agreements with each of Messrs. Kumar, Norrod and Papermaster, the value of the severance  benefit following a termination without cause or a constructive termination within two years after a change in control is equal to a single lump sum severance payment equivalent to two times the executive's rate of annual base pay, plus two  times the target annual bonus in the year of termination. Under the management continuity agreement with Mr. Wolin, the value of the severance benefit following a termination without cause or a constructive termination within two years after a  change in control is equal to a single lump sum severance payment equivalent to three times the executive's rate of annual base pay, plus three times the average of his two highest bonuses in the previous five calendar years. These calculations  assume compensation rates as of December 31, 2018.  
(3)  Amount represents the pro-rata amount of the executive's annual bonus accrued  under the EIP assuming performance at target levels (or, for Mr. Wolin, based on actual 2018 performance) for the portion of the year prior to the date of termination.  
(4)  Amount represents the value of all unvested and accelerated stock options. The value of each stock option is the excess of  the aggregate value of the underlying shares over the aggregate exercise price of the option. Amounts shown also reflect the value of stock option acceleration in the event of a change in control if our successor refuses to assume or substitute  similar awards for outstanding stock options, pursuant to our equity incentive plans.  
(5)  Amount represents the value of all unvested and accelerated RSUs and PRSUs. The number of PRSUs payable reflects actual  (for 2016 grants) or projected (for 2017 and 2018 grants) achievement at the following levels, based on the year of grant: 2016 (250% of target), 2017 (200% of target) and 2018 (100% of target). Amounts shown also reflect the value of award  acceleration in the event of a change in control if the successor refuses to assume or substitute similar awards for outstanding RSUs and PRSUs, pursuant to our equity incentive plans.  
(6)  Under the SVP Severance Plan, the value of the health and welfare benefit following an involuntary termination is equal to  12 months of COBRA medical, dental and/or vision insurance premiums, based on the participant's benefits plan elections in effect at the time of termination, and use of the employee assistance plan provided by us as part of the 12 months of  COBRA coverage.  
(7)  Amount reflects our annual cost of paying COBRA premiums on behalf of Messrs. Kumar, Norrod, Papermaster and Wolin for 12  months following termination based on the rates of a current employee. Also includes gross-ups for income taxes in the amounts of $21,834, $13,885, $23,797 and $12,740 due by Messrs. Kumar, Norrod, Papermaster  and Wolin, respectively, as a result of our payment of health and welfare benefits on their behalf.  
(8)  Pursuant to our Executive Life Insurance Benefit Plan, amount reflects a life insurance payout equal to three times the  Named Executive Officer's base salary, which is $565,000 for Mr. Kumar, $550,000 for Mr. Norrod, $600,000 for Mr. Papermaster and $520,000 for Mr. Wolin.  
(9)  In the event that the severance and other benefits provided would be subject to excise taxes imposed by Section 280G  and Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such amount will either be delivered in full or reduced so as not to be subject to excise taxation, whichever amount is higher, pursuant to the terms of our Change in Control Agreement.   
(10)  Amount reflects our annual cost of paying Mr. Wolin's life insurance premium for 12 months following his  termination and includes an $880 gross-up for income taxes as a result of our paying the premium on his behalf.  
(11)  Represents a gross-up for excise taxes imposed under Section 4999 of the  Internal Revenue Code. Pursuant to the management continuity agreement, if benefits provided to Mr. Wolin are subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 280G and Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, then Mr. Wolin will be  paid an amount necessary to place him in the same after-tax position as he would have been had no excise tax or penalty been imposed.

As of March 18, 2019, WCH beneficially owned approximately 6.9% of our outstanding common stock. 
Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement among us, Mubadala Tech and WCH dated on October 6, 2008, as amended, WCH has the right to designate one person for election to our Board for so long as WCH and its permitted transferees beneficially own at least 10% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Yahia, who has been a member of our Board since November 2012, has been WCH's designated representative on our Board. Mr. Yahia serves as the CEO of the Technology, Manufacturing & Mining global platform of Mubadala and is also Chairman of GF. In February 2019, WCH ceased to beneficially own at least 10% of our outstanding common stock. Mr. Yahia is not being nominated for re-election to the Board at the Annual Meeting. 
Wafer Supply Agreement with GF.    On March 2, 2009, in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Master Transaction Agreement, we entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the "WSA") with GF. The WSA governs the terms by which we purchase products manufactured by GF. Pursuant to the WSA, we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and accelerated processing unit ("APU") product requirements and a certain portion of our graphics processing unit ("GPU") product requirements from GF with limited exceptions. If we acquire a third-party business that manufactures microprocessor and APU products, we will have up to two years to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and APU products to GF. 
The WSA terminates no later than March 2, 2024. GF has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to assist us to transition the supply of products to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase orders for up to two years following the termination or expiration of the WSA. During the transition period, pricing for microprocessor and APU products will remain as set forth in the WSA, but our purchase commitments to GF will no longer apply. 
On August 30, 2016, we entered into a sixth amendment to the WSA. The sixth amendment modifies certain terms of the WSA applicable to wafers for our microprocessor, graphics processor and semi-custom products for a five-year period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. 
The sixth amendment also provides us a limited waiver with rights to contract with another wafer foundry with respect to certain products in the 14nm and 7nm technology nodes and gives us greater flexibility in sourcing foundry services across our product portfolio. In consideration for these rights, we agreed to pay GF $100 million, which was paid in installments starting in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2016 through the third fiscal quarter of 2017. Starting in 2017 and continuing through 2020, we also agreed to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry. 
Further, for each calendar year during the term of the sixth amendment, we agreed to annual wafer purchase targets that increase from 2016 through 2020. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any calendar year, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. 
We also agreed on pricing for wafers purchased during the 2016 year and established a framework to agree on annual wafer pricing for the years 2017 to 2020. 
On January 29, 2019, we entered into a seventh amendment to the WSA. The Seventh Amendment modifies certain purchase commitments, pricing and other terms of the WSA applicable to wafer purchases at the 12 nm technology node and above by us for the period commencing on January 1, 2019 and continuing through March 1, 2024. The Seventh Amendment also provides us with full flexibility to contract with any wafer foundry with respect to

 all products manufactured using 7nm and smaller technology nodes without any one-time payments or royalties by us to GF. Further, we and GF agreed to modify the annual wafer purchase targets previously agreed to in the sixth amendment of the WSA for years 2019 and 2020. The parties also agreed to an annual wafer purchase target for 2021 and agreed to pricing for wafers purchased for years 2019, 2020 and 2021. If we do not meet the annual wafer purchase target for any of these years, we will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchases and the wafer purchase target for that year. These annual targets were established based on our current business and market expectations. Our total purchases from GF related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activities were approximately $1.6 billion in fiscal 2018. We expect that our future purchases from GF will continue to be material under the WSA, which is in place until 2024.

AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE'S REPORT 
The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board consists of Mr. Householder, as Chair, and Messrs. Caldwell, Inglis and Marren. Each of the members of the Audit and Finance Committee is "independent" and "financially literate," as determined by the Board and in compliance with SEC and Nasdaq rules. In addition, Mr. Householder was determined to be an "audit committee financial expert," as that term is defined under SEC rules. 
The Audit and Finance Committee oversees our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm and assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities on matters relating to the integrity of AMD's financial statements and the effectiveness of AMD's internal control over financial reporting, AMD's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the performance of our internal audit function and the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence and performance by meeting regularly with the independent registered public accounting firm, our senior management and our internal audit, financial, and legal personnel. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of AMD's financial statements and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of AMD's annual financial statements and of the effectiveness of AMD's internal control over financial reporting and expressing opinions on both in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit and Finance Committee reviewed and discussed AMD's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 with management and Ernst & Young LLP, AMD's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Finance Committee also discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board AS 1301 "Communications with Audit Committees." This included a discussion of the independent registered public accounting firm's judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of AMD's accounting principles and such other matters that generally accepted auditing standards require to be discussed with the Audit and Finance Committee. The Audit and Finance Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed the independence of Ernst & Young LLP with that firm. 
Based on the Audit and Finance Committee's review and discussions noted above, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements be included in AMD's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
The Audit and Finance Committee and the Board also have recommended, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as AMD's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

ITEM 2—RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit and Finance Committee of our Board is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Finance Committee has selected Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019 and has further directed that management submit the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm for ratification by our stockholders at the annual meeting. 
Although ratification by our stockholders is not a prerequisite to the Audit and Finance Committee's ability to select Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit and Finance Committee believes such ratification is advisable and in the best interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, stockholders are being requested to ratify, confirm and approve the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm to conduct the annual audit of our consolidated financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting for the current fiscal year. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP, the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm will be reconsidered by the Audit and Finance Committee; provided, however, the Audit and Finance Committee may select Ernst & Young LLP notwithstanding the failure of our stockholders to ratify its selection. If the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is ratified, the Audit and Finance Committee will continue to conduct an ongoing review of Ernst & Young LLP's scope of engagement, pricing and work quality, among other factors, and will retain the right to replace Ernst & Young LLP at any time. 
Unless you vote otherwise, your proxy will vote for the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year. The Audit and Finance Committee meets with Ernst & Young LLP several times a year. A representative of Ernst & Young LLP is expected to be present at our Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires. He or she will also be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. 
Required Vote 
Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote and present in person or represented by proxy at our Annual Meeting. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Because brokers and other nominees have discretionary authority to vote on the ratification, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with this item. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the current year. Unless you vote otherwise, your proxy will vote FOR ratification. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm's Fees 
The following is a summary and description of fees billed for services provided by Ernst & Young LLP for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 (in thousands).

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
Our Audit and Finance Committee Charter provides that the Audit and Finance Committee must pre-approve the engagement before an independent registered public accounting firm is engaged by us or our subsidiaries to render audit or non-audit services. Audit and Finance Committee pre-approval of audit and non-audit services is not required if the engagement for the services is entered into pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures established by the Audit and Finance Committee regarding our engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, provided the policies and procedures are detailed as to the particular service, the committee is informed of each service provided and such policies and procedures do not include delegation to our management of the committee's responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit and Finance Committee may delegate to one or more designated members of the committee the authority to grant pre-approvals, provided such approvals are presented to the committee at a subsequent meeting. If the Audit and Finance Committee elects to establish pre-approval policies and procedures regarding non-audit services, the Audit and Finance Committee must be informed of each non-audit service provided by the independent auditor. 
Our Audit and Finance Committee reviews both audit and non-audit services performed by Ernst & Young LLP and the fees charged for such services on at least an annual basis. Among other things, the Audit and Finance Committee examines the effect that the performance of non-audit services may have upon the independence of Ernst & Young LLP. All services provided by Ernst & Young LLP in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit and Finance Committee after review of each of the services proposed for approval.

ITEM 3—APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC. 2004 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
We are asking our stockholders to approve the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan to: (i) increase the number of authorized shares that can be issued to our employees, consultants and directors under the 2004 Plan by 29 million shares and (ii) update the plan for certain tax law changes. 
Upon recommendation of our Compensation Committee, in February 2019 our Board unanimously approved the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan, subject to stockholder approval. If the stockholders do not approve this proposal, the amendments to the 2004 Plan will not become effective and the 2004 Plan will continue in its current form in full force and effect. 
This proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the proposal and present in person or represented by proxy at our Annual Meeting. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Our Named Executive Officers and directors will be eligible to receive awards under the 2004 Plan and therefore have an interest in this proposal. Unless you indicate otherwise, your proxy will vote for the approval of the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan. 
Why the Board is Seeking Approval of the Amendment and Restatement of the 2004 Plan 
Equity incentive awards in the form of stock options, RSUs and PRSUs help to attract, motivate, and retain key employees, align employee and stockholder interests, and link employee compensation to our performance. As we explained in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," above, equity is a significant component of total compensation for many of our senior management and other key employees. The Board believes it is important to obtain an additional 29 million shares for grant under the 2004 Plan, which is the sole equity compensation plan under which we grant equity compensation awards. In this proxy statement, we refer to any grant from the 2004 Plan as an "Award." 
The 2004 Plan is our only plan for providing equity incentive compensation to our employees, other than our 2017 ESPP, which allows employees to purchase our stock at a discount. As of March 1, 2019, awards covering an aggregate number of 40,153,627 shares were outstanding under the 2004 Plan (assuming the maximum payout of each outstanding unearned PRSU), and 38,071,743 shares remained available for grants of future awards. As of March 1, 2019, approximately 10,270 employees (including executive officers), eight non-employee directors and no consultants were eligible for awards under the 2004 Plan based on the Company's internal guidelines. If stockholders do not approve the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan, the 2004 Plan will remain in effect until July 31, 2024; however, the shares available under the 2004 Plan may be quickly depleted and our ability to use equity as a compensation and retention tool will be limited. The Board anticipates that the additional shares will enable us to fund our current equity compensation program for at least the next year, accommodating anticipated grants related to the hiring, retention and promotion of employees. 
In setting the number of additional shares issuable under the 2004 Plan, our Compensation Committee and Board considered a number of factors, including: shares currently available under the 2004 Plan and how long the shares available (both currently and assuming the approval by stockholders of this proposal) are expected to last; historical equity award granting practices, and the burn rate and dilution metrics disclosed below under "Key Equity Metrics." In addition, our Compensation Committee and our Board considered the stockholder value transfer and dilution policies of certain major proxy advisory firms. The closing price of our common stock on March 1, 2019 was $23.68. 
YOU ARE URGED TO READ THIS ENTIRE PROPOSAL, WHICH EXPLAINS OUR 
REASONS FOR SUPPORTING THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE 2004 PLAN 
Provisions Designed to Protect Stockholders 
The 2004 Plan and our governance policies contain a number of provisions that we believe are designed to protect stockholder interests, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No liberal share counting. The 2004 Plan prohibits the reuse of shares withheld or delivered to satisfy  the exercise price of a stock option or to satisfy tax withholding requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No repricing of stock options. The 2004 Plan does not permit the repricing of stock options either by  amending an existing award or by substituting a new award at a lower price without stockholder approval.

ITEM 3—Approval of the Amendment and Restatement of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (continued) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• One-year minimum vesting period. Subject to limited exceptions,  the 2004 Plan requires a one-year minimum vesting period on Awards of stock options, Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), RSUs and restricted stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No discounted stock options. The 2004 Plan prohibits the granting of stock options with an exercise  price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limitation on term of stock options. The maximum term of each stock option is ten years.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recoupment (or claw-back policy). Under our Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct, we expressly reserve the  right to claw-back incentive-based or other compensation (including equity-based compensation) paid to an employee if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of our material noncompliance with any financial reporting laws.  In addition, all equity awards granted to our executive officers include a compensation recovery ("claw-back") provision.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No excise tax gross-up payments. We will not enter into any new  change in control agreement or arrangement with an executive officer that provides for an excise tax gross-up payment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No dividends payable on unvested awards. The 2004 Plan prohibits the current payment of dividends on unvested  Awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Ownership Guidelines. Our stock ownership requirements provide that our Chief Executive Officer  should attain an investment position in our common stock having a value that is equal to the lesser of (a) the number of shares equal to five times her base salary or (b) 350,000 shares. Our other Named Executive Officers should attain an  investment position in our common stock having a value that is equal to the lesser of (x) the number of shares equal to two times their base salaries or (y) 80,000 shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Anti-hedging and pledging policy. Our employees and directors are not permitted to hedge their economic  exposure to our equity securities, meaning that they may not engage in buying or selling puts or calls or short-selling our securities. Our employees, including our Named Executive Officers and our directors, are not permitted to pledge our equity  securities without the preapproval of the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board, which is only expected to be granted in very limited circumstances.

Key Equity Metrics 
Approval of the amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan will enable us to continue to compete effectively in the highly competitive market for talent, while maintaining a reasonable burn rate. The following table sets forth the burn rate for 2016 through 2018 under the 2004 Plan:

Summary of the 2004 Plan 
The following paragraphs provide a brief summary of the principal features of the 2004 Plan and its operation. Because the following is a summary, it may not contain all of the information that is important to you. A copy of the 2004 Plan, as amended and restated, is attached as Exhibit A to this proxy statement. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 2004 Plan as set forth in Exhibit A.

ITEM 3—Approval of the Amendment and Restatement of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (continued) 
Background and Purpose of the 2004 Plan 
The 2004 Plan permits the grant of the following types of Awards: (i) non-statutory stock options that are not intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code, incentive stock options that are intended to qualify for favorable tax treatment under Section 422 of the Code and stock appreciation rights granted at the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant ("Fair Market Value Awards"), and (ii) restricted stock awards and RSUs ("Full Value Awards"). The amendment and restatement of the 2004 Plan increases the total number of shares available for grant under the plan by 29 million shares to 283,150,000 shares (which includes 38,071,743 shares remaining available for grant under the plan as of March 1, 2019). 
The 2004 Plan is intended to attract, motivate and retain employees, consultants and non-employee directors who provide significant services to us. The 2004 Plan also is intended to further our growth and profitability by motivating award recipients to think and act like owners. 
Administration of the 2004 Plan 
The Board or a delegate or committee appointed by the Board administers the 2004 Plan. The Board has appointed the Compensation Committee as the administrator of the 2004 Plan. Awards may also be made pursuant to the Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy subject to limitations set forth in the 2004 Plan. 
Subject to the terms of the 2004 Plan, the Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to select the employees and consultants who will receive Awards, determine the terms and conditions of Awards (for example, the exercise price and vesting schedule) and interpret the provisions of the 2004 Plan and outstanding Awards. The Compensation Committee may delegate any part of its authority and powers under the 2004 Plan to one or more of our directors and/or executive officers, but only the Compensation Committee itself can grant Awards to participants who are our executive officers. 
If we experience a stock dividend, reorganization or other change in our capital structure, the Compensation Committee has the discretion to adjust the number of shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan, the outstanding Awards and the per-person limits on Awards, as appropriate to reflect the stock dividend or other change. 
Eligibility to Receive Awards; Performance Criteria 
The Compensation Committee selects the employees and consultants who will be granted Awards under the 2004 Plan. Non-statutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and stock appreciation rights may be granted to employees, consultants and directors, subject to the limitations set forth in the 2004 Plan. Incentive stock options can only be granted to employees. The actual number of individuals who will receive Awards under the 2004 Plan cannot be determined in advance because the Compensation Committee has the discretion to select the participants. No individual may receive Award(s) covering more than 10 million shares under the 2004 Plan in any calendar year, except that an individual may receive Award(s) covering up to 15 million shares during his or her first 12 months of service. 
The Compensation Committee may impose whatever time- or performance-based vesting conditions that it determines to be appropriate. However, no portion of any Award of stock options, SARs, RSUs or restricted stock will vest before the first anniversary of the date of grant except in connection with a participant's death, disability or termination of service, or a change of control. The Compensation Committee may provide for a vesting period of less than one-year if the shorter vesting period is set forth in the award documentation or other agreement between the participant and the Company as of the date of grant; provided, that, the maximum number of shares covered under Awards of stock options, SARs, RSUs or restricted stock granted after April 29, 2015, that are not subject to the foregoing one-year vesting requirement may not exceed five percent (5%) of the shares that may be authorized for grant under the 2004 Plan (as such authorized number of shares may be adjusted as provided under the terms of the 2004 Plan). 
The Compensation Committee may decide to condition the grant, vesting and/or exercise of an Award upon the satisfaction of one or more performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may set performance periods and performance goals that differ from participant to participant and may choose any performance goals deemed appropriate in light of the participant's specific role and responsibilities. After the end of the applicable performance period, a determination will be made as to the extent to which the performance goals applicable to each participant were achieved or exceeded. The actual Award (if any) for a participant will be determined by the level of actual performance.

ITEM 3—Approval of the Amendment and Restatement of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (continued) 
Fair Market Value Awards 
Under the 2004 Plan, the Compensation Committee can make the following Fair Market Value Awards: 
Stock Options.    A stock option is the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a fixed exercise price for a fixed period of time. Under the 2004 Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant non-statutory and incentive stock options. The Compensation Committee determines the number of shares covered by each option. 
The exercise price of the shares subject to each non-statutory stock option and incentive stock option cannot be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The 2004 Plan prohibits any repricing of options after their grant, other than with stockholder approval. 
Any option granted under the 2004 Plan cannot be exercised until it becomes vested. The Compensation Committee establishes the vesting schedule of each option at the time of the grant. Options become exercisable at the times and on the terms established by the Compensation Committee. Options granted under the 2004 Plan expire at the times established by the Compensation Committee, but not later than ten years after the grant date. 
The exercise price of each option granted under the 2004 Plan must be paid in full at the time of the exercise. The Compensation Committee may also permit payment by check, the tender of shares that are already owned by the participant, a broker-assisted cashless exercise, any combination of the foregoing or by any other means that the Compensation Committee determines to be consistent with the purpose of the 2004 Plan. 
Stock Appreciation Rights.    Awards of stock appreciation rights may be granted pursuant to the 2004 Plan. The Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of stock appreciation rights. However, no stock appreciation right may be granted with an exercise price that is less than fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant or have a term of over ten years from the date of grant. Upon exercising a stock appreciation right, the holder of such right shall be entitled to receive payment from us in an amount determined by multiplying (i) the difference between the closing price of a share of our common stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price by (ii) the number of shares with respect to which the stock appreciation right is exercised. Our obligation arising upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right may be paid in shares or in cash, or any combination thereof, as the Compensation Committee may determine. The Compensation Committee may choose to grant stock appreciation rights in tandem with the grant of stock options, such that the exercise of either the stock option or the stock appreciation right would cancel the other. 
Awards to Non-Employee Directors 
Non-employee directors' initial and annual equity awards are made in the form of RSUs. See "Directors' Compensation and Benefits," above, for a discussion of our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy. However, under the terms of the 2004 Plan the aggregate grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes of Awards granted during a calendar year to a non-employee director as compensation for his or her service as a director, taken together with the cash fees paid during the calendar year to the non-employee director as compensation for his or her services as a director, may not exceed $500,000 in total value in the case of a director other than the Chairman of the Board, or $1 million in total value in the case of the Chairman of the Board. 
Full Value Awards 
Under the 2004 Plan, the Compensation Committee can make the following Full Value Awards: 
Restricted Stock.    Awards of restricted stock are shares that vest in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee. The purchase price for an award of restricted stock, if any, shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee determines the number of shares of restricted stock granted to any employee or consultant and any terms and conditions that must be satisfied, including vesting conditions and/or satisfaction of performance goals. Once the restricted stock is issued, voting, dividend and other rights as a stockholder will exist with respect to the restricted stock. However, the restricted stock will not be transferable until the restricted stock vests. 
Restricted Stock Units.    RSUs obligate us to pay the recipient of the award a value equal to the fair market value of a specific number of shares of our common stock in the future if the RSUs are earned and vest in accordance with

 the terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee. Payment under an RSU may be made in cash or in shares of our common stock. The purchase price for the shares, if any, shall be determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee determines the number of shares that are subject to such RSUs and any terms and conditions that must be satisfied, including vesting conditions and/or satisfaction of performance goals. A holder of an RSU does not have any rights as a stockholder until shares of common stock, if any, are issued with respect to the RSU. Payment under an RSU will be made at a time that is permissible under or exempt from Section 409A of the Code. The Compensation Committee may permit a participant to defer the receipt of cash or shares pursuant to an RSU under the 2004 Plan. Any such deferral will be administered as determined by the Compensation Committee and in a manner that is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code. 
Change of Control 
In the event of a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, our successor will either assume or provide a substitute award for each outstanding Award. In the event our successor refuses to assume or provide a substitute award, the Compensation Committee is required to provide at least 15 days' notice that the Award will immediately vest and become exercisable, as applicable, as to all of the shares subject to such Award, except for performance-based Awards which will not vest unless the applicable performance criteria have been achieved, and that such Award will terminate upon the expiration of such notice period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of our change of control, the Awards described under "Awards to Non-Employee Directors," above, will immediately vest in full. 
If, within one year after a change of control, a participant's employment is terminated for any reason other than for misconduct (as defined in the 2004 Plan) or, with respect to certain participants who are executive officers, there is a constructive termination (as defined in the 2004 Plan) of their employment, all Awards held by that participant will become fully vested, except for performance-based Awards which will not vest unless the applicable performance criteria have been achieved (unless otherwise specified in the participant's Award agreement, employment agreement or other agreement with us, see "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements," above). A constructive termination generally occurs if the executive officer resigns because of a diminution or adverse change in his or her conditions of employment. In general, a "change of control" will be deemed to have occurred upon the acquisition of more than 20 percent of either the then-outstanding shares of our common stock or the combined voting power of our then outstanding securities, a change in the majority of the Board over a two-year period (generally excluding any new directors approved by two-thirds of the existing members of the Board), certain mergers or corporate transactions in which we are not the surviving entity, our liquidation or a sale of substantially all of our assets. 
Non-Transferability of Awards 
Unless determined otherwise by the Compensation Committee, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred or disposed of in any manner, other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution, and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the participant, only by the participant. 
Federal Tax Aspects 
The following is a general summary under current law of the material federal income tax consequences of the grant, vesting and exercise of Awards under the 2004 Plan. This summary deals with general tax principles that apply only to employees who are citizens or residents of the United States and is provided only for general information purposes. The following discussion does not address the tax consequences of Awards that may be subject to and do not comply with the rules and guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. Section 409A has implications that affect traditional deferred compensation plans, as well as certain equity awards. Accordingly, additional adverse tax consequences could apply to certain equity awards as a result of Section 409A based on the terms of the equity awards or modifications that have been made to the provisions of the equity awards. 
The following discussion does not purport to be complete, and does not cover, among other things, federal employment tax and state and local income and employment tax treatment of participants in the 2004 Plan. Tax laws are complex and subject to change and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. The summary does not discuss all aspects of income taxation that may be relevant in light of personal circumstances. This summarized tax information is not tax advice.

ITEM 3—Approval of the Amendment and Restatement of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (continued) 
Incentive Stock Options 
No taxable income is reportable when an incentive stock option is granted to a participant, when that option vests or when that option is exercised. However, the amount by which the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise exceeds the option price will be an "item of adjustment" for a participant for purposes of the alternative minimum tax, unless the participant sells or otherwise disposes of the shares in the year of exercise. Gain realized on the sale of shares issued under an incentive stock option is taxable at capital gains rates, unless the participant disposes of the shares within (i) two years after the date of grant of the option or (ii) within one year of the date the shares were transferred to the participant. If the shares of common stock are sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of the one-year or two-year periods specified above, the difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of the options' exercise will be taxed at ordinary income rates. If the participant sells or otherwise disposes the shares before the end of the one-year or two-year periods specified above, the maximum amount that will be included as alternative minimum tax income is the gain, if any, the participant recognizes on the disposition of the shares. 
Non-Statutory Stock Options 
No taxable income is reportable when a non-statutory stock option is granted to a participant or when the option vests. Upon exercise, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value (on the exercise date) of the shares purchased over the exercise price of the option. 
Stock Appreciation Rights 
No taxable income is reportable when a stock appreciation right is granted to a participant or when the stock appreciation right vests. Upon exercise, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the amount of cash received and the fair market value of any shares received. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of any shares issued would be capital gain or loss. 
Restricted Stock 
Generally, a participant will not have taxable income upon grant of restricted stock. Instead, he or she will recognize ordinary income, if any, at the time of vesting equal to the fair market value of the shares received (determined as of the date of vesting) minus any amount paid for the shares. If the participant files an election to be taxed under Section 83(b) of the Code, the tax consequences to the participant will be determined as of the date of the grant of the restricted stock rather than at the time of vesting. 
Restricted Stock Units 
A participant will generally not recognize taxable income at the time of the grant of a RSU or when the RSU vests. When an award is paid (whether it is at or after the time that the award vests), the participant will recognize ordinary income. In the event of an award that is paid or settled at a time following the vesting date, income tax may be deferred beyond vesting and until shares are actually delivered or payment is made to the participant if deferred in compliance with the timing of distributions and other requirements under Section 409A of the Code. 
Gain or Loss on Sale or Disposition of Shares 
In general, gain or loss from the sale or disposition of shares granted or awarded under the 2004 Plan will be treated as capital gain or loss, provided that the shares are held as capital assets at the time of the sale or exchange. 
Withholding 
Where an award results in income subject to withholding, we may require the participant to remit the withholding amount to us or cause shares of common stock to be withheld or sold in order to satisfy the tax withholding obligations. 
Tax Effect for Us 
Generally we are entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an Award under the 2004 Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income realized by a participant and at the time the participant recognizes such income (for example, the exercise of a non-statutory stock option), provided that, among other things, the income meets the test

 of reasonableness, is an ordinary and necessary business expense, is not an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and is not disallowed by Section 162(m) of the Code. 
Section 162(m) of the Code imposes an annual deduction limitation of $1 million on the amount of compensation paid to certain of our top executive officers. Prior to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), the deduction limit did not apply to "performance-based compensation" that complied with certain conditions imposed by Section 162(m) of the Code (as in effect prior to the Tax Act ("Prior 162(m)"). The Tax Act provides limited transition relief for "performance-based compensation" paid pursuant to certain grandfathered arrangements in effect as of November 2, 2017, provided the grandfathered arrangements are not materially modified. There are a number of outstanding Awards of stock options and PRSUs that were granted under the 2004 Plan before November 2, 2017, that were intended, at the time of grant, to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Prior Section 162(m) and nothing in the 2004 Plan is intended to modify in any material respect any of the terms of those Awards. While little guidance has been issued on the scope of the transition relief, its application is based on interpretation and no assurance can be given as to whether outstanding Awards that are intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" will be fully deductible by us. In any event, the Compensation Committee retains full discretion to grant non-deductible awards under the Plan or materially modify outstanding Awards if, in its judgment, it is in our best interest to do so. 
Additionally, under the so-called "golden parachute" provisions of Section 280G of the Code, the accelerated vesting of Awards in connection with a change of control may be required to be valued and taken into account in determining whether participants have received compensatory payments contingent on the change of control, in excess of certain limits. If these limits are exceeded, a portion of the amounts payable to the participant may be subject to an additional 20% federal tax and may be nondeductible by us. 
Amendment and Termination of the 2004 Plan and Prohibition on Repricing or Exchange of Awards Without Stockholder Approval 
The Board generally may amend or terminate the 2004 Plan at any time and for any reason; provided, however, that the Board cannot reprice or otherwise exchange awards under the 2004 Plan, amend the 2004 Plan to increase the number of shares available under the 2004 Plan or change the class of employees eligible to participate in the 2004 Plan without stockholder consent. Under the terms of the 2004 Plan, the 2004 Plan will continue in effect until July 31, 2024. 
New Plan Benefits 
The equity awards granted under the 2004 Plan are to be made in the future and are therefore currently undeterminable. Equity awards granted under the 2004 Plan are at the discretion of the Compensation Committee which has not yet determined the future awards or recipients. 
Historically, our non-employee directors have received annual equity grants under the 2004 Plan, pursuant to our Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy. Non-employee directors are generally eligible to receive an annual RSU award (an "Annual RSU Award") upon re-election at each annual meeting of stockholders. Under our current Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy, which was amended in October 2017, the Annual RSU Award for each non-employee director (other than the Chairman of the Board) who has served on the Board for at least six months prior to an annual meeting of stockholders is calculated based on the following formula, with no discretionary component: the quotient of (i) $185,000 (the "Target Equity Value") divided by (ii) the average closing price of our common stock for the 30-trading day period preceding and ending with the date of the respective RSU grant. See "Directors' Compensation and Benefits" above for additional information about these equity grants.

ITEM 4—APPROVAL ON A NON-BINDING, ADVISORY BASIS OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ("SAY-ON-PAY") 
We are seeking an advisory vote from our stockholders to approve the compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Unless you indicate otherwise, your proxy will vote for the approval of the compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers. 
The Compensation Committee, with assistance from its independent executive compensation consultant and counsel, has structured our executive compensation program to reflect our "pay-for-performance" philosophy. A significant portion of the compensation opportunities provided to the Named Executive Officers are dependent on our financial performance, which are intended to drive the creation of stockholder value. The Compensation Committee intends to continue to emphasize responsible compensation arrangements that attract, retain and motivate high caliber executive officers, motivate these executive officers to achieve our short-term and long-term business strategies and objectives and support our career development and succession goals. 
We have determined to hold a "say-on-pay" advisory vote every year. In accordance with this determination and Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as a matter of good corporate governance, you have the opportunity to vote "for" or "against," or to "abstain" from voting on, the following non-binding resolution relating to executive compensation: 
"Resolved, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and the narrative discussion of such proxy statement." 
In deciding how to vote on this proposal, you are encouraged to consider our executive compensation philosophy and objectives and the elements of our executive compensation program, as contained in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" above, as well as the following principles of our executive compensation program and other information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay-for-Performance is Important.  The Compensation Committee places a strong emphasis on performance-based compensation. To this end, approximately 91% of Dr. Su's and 83% of the other Named Executive Officer's aggregate total direct compensation opportunity (i.e.,  base salary, annual target cash performance bonus opportunity and target value of annual long-term equity awards for 2018) was in the form of a cash performance bonus and long-term equity awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Claw-Back Provisions and Policies in Effect. In addition to the adoption of other related policies, the Compensation  Committee has implemented "claw-back" provisions and policies applicable to equity awards granted since May 2010 to employees at or above the senior vice president level, which includes all of the Named Executive Officers.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay Practices Aligned with Sound Risk Management. The Compensation Committee endeavors to structure our executive  compensation program to motivate and reward the Named Executive Officers for appropriately balancing opportunity and risk, such as investing in key initiatives designed to advance our growth in existing and new markets while at the same time  avoiding pay practices that encourage excessive risk-taking. In connection with the Compensation Committee's review of our compensation policies and practices for all employees in general, the Compensation Committee concluded that these  policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Ownership Guidelines in Effect. Our stock ownership requirements are designed to increase the Named Executive  Officers' stakes in us and to align their interest more closely with those of our stockholders. As of December 29, 2018, each of the Named Executive Officers were on track to comply with our stock ownership guidelines.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Policies Intended to Comport to Best Practices with respect to Change in Control Payments in Effect. During fiscal  2018, the Compensation Committee continued to adhere to the executive compensation policies it previously adopted, namely, the Compensation Committee will not approve any change in control arrangement that provides for excise tax gross-ups or cash severance payments in excess of (i) two times the sum of the executive officer's base salary and annual target bonus, plus (ii) a prorated annual target bonus for the year in which  termination occurs.

ITEM 4—Approval on a Non-binding, Advisory Basis of the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers ("say-on-pay") (continued) 
Required Vote 
Approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote on the proposal and present in person or represented by proxy at our Annual Meeting. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
While your vote on this proposal is advisory and will not be binding on the Compensation Committee, the Board or us, the Board and the Compensation Committee values the opinions of our stockholders on executive compensation matters and will take the results of this advisory vote into consideration when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program. Unless the Board or the Compensation Committee modifies the determination on the frequency of future "say-on-pay" advisory votes, the next "say-on-pay" advisory vote will be held at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the approval of the compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Unless you vote otherwise, your proxy will vote FOR the approval of the compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers.

Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator, an Award may not be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of in any manner other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the recipient, only by the recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may an Award be sold, pledged, assigned, hypothecated, transferred, or disposed of for consideration absent stockholder approval.

  (b)  Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the  Administrator shall notify each Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. The Administrator in its discretion may provide for a Participant to have the right to exercise his or her Award until ten  (10) days prior to such transaction as to all of the Awarded Stock covered thereby, including Shares as to which the Award would not otherwise be exercisable. In addition, the Administrator may provide that any Company repurchase option or  forfeiture rights applicable to any Award shall lapse 100%, and that any Award vesting shall accelerate 100%, provided the proposed dissolution or liquidation takes place at the time and in the manner contemplated. To the extent it has not been  previously exercised or vested an Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  Merger or Asset Sale. In the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation (as such merger is  described in Section 2(h) herein), or the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company (as such sale is described in Section 2(h) herein), each outstanding Award shall be assumed or an equivalent Award substituted by the  successor corporation or related corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the Award, the Participant shall fully vest in and have the right to fully exercise the Awards and all forfeiture  restrictions on any or all of such Awards shall lapse, including Shares as to which it would not otherwise be vested or exercisable. If an Award becomes fully vested and exercisable in lieu of assumption or substitution in the event of such a merger  or sale of assets, the Administrator shall notify the Participant in writing or electronically that the Award shall be fully vested and exercisable for a period of fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice, and the Award shall terminate  upon the expiration of such period. For the purposes of this subsection, the Award shall be considered assumed if, following such merger or sale of assets, the Award confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share of Awarded Stock subject  to the Award immediately prior to such merger or sale of assets, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in such merger or sale of assets by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date  of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares); provided, however, that if such consideration received in such merger or sale of  assets is not solely common stock of the successor corporation or related corporation, the Administrator may, with the consent of the successor corporation, provide for the consideration to be received upon the exercise of the Award, for each Share  of Awarded Stock subject to the Award, to be solely common stock of the successor corporation or related corporation equal in fair market value to the per share consideration received by holders of Common Stock in such merger or sale of assets.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (d)  Change of Control. Unless otherwise provided in a Participant's agreement for services as an employee of the  Company, if, within one year after a Change of Control has occurred, such Participant's status as an employee of the Company is terminated by the Company (including for this purpose any successor to the Company due to such Change of Control and  any employer that is an Affiliate of such successor) for any reason other than for Misconduct or, if applicable, terminated by such Participant as a Constructive Termination, then all Awards held by such Participant shall become fully vested for  exercise upon the date of termination of such status, irrespective of the vesting provisions of such Participant's Award Documentations.

[END TABLE]
19. Inability to Obtain Authority. The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder (or the cash equivalent thereof), shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares (or the cash equivalent thereof) as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. 
20. Reservation of Shares. The Company, during the term of this Plan, will at all times reserve and keep available such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the Plan. 
21. Stockholder Approval. This Plan shall be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date of adoption by the Board. Such stockholder approval shall be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.

To the extent applicable, the Plan and Award Documentations shall be interpreted in accordance with Section 409A of the Code and Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Accordingly, with respect to an Award that the Administrator determines is subject to Section 409A of the Code, (a) termination of services as a Service Provider shall be determined based on the principles under Section 409A of the Code regarding a separation from service, (b) if the Change of Control definition contained in the Award Documentation does not comport with the definition of "change of control" for purposes of a distribution under Section 409A of the Code, then any payment due under such Award shall be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permitted under Section 409A of the Code and (c) if the Administrator determines that the Participant granted such Award is a "specified employee" as defined under Section 409A of the Code, then any payment due under such Award upon the Participant's separation from service shall not be paid until the first business day following the date that is 6 months following the date of the Participant's separation from service. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, in the event that following the Effective Date the Administrator determines that any Award may be subject to Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance (including such Department of Treasury guidance as may be issued after the Effective Date), the Administrator may adopt such amendments to the Plan and the applicable Award Documentation or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions, that the Administrator determines are necessary or appropriate to (a) exempt the Award from Section 409A of the Code and/or preserve the intended tax treatment of the benefits provided with respect to the Award, or (b) comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and related Department of Treasury guidance and thereby avoid the application of any penalty taxes under such Section.
