This proxy statement and your proxy card are furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors for use in connection with the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders of Palo Alto Networks, Inc. ("Palo Alto Networks" or our "company"), a Delaware corporation, and any postponements, adjournments or continuations thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). The Annual Meeting will be held on Friday, December 7, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, at our headquarters, located at 3000 Tannery Way, Santa Clara, California 95054. A Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access this proxy statement and our annual report is first being mailed on or about October 22, 2018 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not intended to be incorporated by reference into this proxy statement and references to our website address in this proxy statement are inactive textual references only. 
The information provided in the "question and answer" format below is for your convenience only and is merely a summary of the information contained in this proxy statement. You should read this entire proxy statement carefully. 
What matters am I voting on? 
You will be voting on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a proposal to approve, on an advisory basis, the frequency of holding future advisory votes on executive  compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
How does the board of directors recommend I vote on these proposals?

[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered  public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For every "1 year" as the frequency of holding future advisory votes on executive compensation.   
[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote? 
Holders of our common stock as of the close of business on October 15, 2018 (the "Record Date"), may vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, 94,314,751 shares of our common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. In deciding all matters at the Annual Meeting, each stockholder will be entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock held by them on the Record Date. Stockholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors. 
- 1 - 
Registered Stockholders. If shares of our common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Notice was provided to you directly by us. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the individuals listed on the proxy card or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Throughout this proxy statement, we refer to these registered stockholders as "stockholders of record." 
Street Name Stockholders. If shares of our common stock are held on your behalf in a brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered to be the beneficial owner of shares that are held in "street name," and the Notice was forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee, who is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee as to how to vote your shares. Beneficial owners are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since a beneficial owner is not the stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you follow your broker, bank, or other nominee's procedures for obtaining a legal proxy and present your legal proxy at the Annual Meeting. If you request a printed copy of our proxy materials by mail, your broker, bank or other nominee will provide a voting instruction form for you to use. Throughout this proxy statement, we refer to stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, bank or other nominee as "street name stockholders." 
Can I attend the Annual Meeting? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may attend the Annual Meeting if you are a stockholder of record or a street name stockholder as of  October 15, 2018. All stockholders must bring proof of identification, such as a driver's license or passport, for admission to the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you are a stockholder of record, your name will be verified against the list of stockholders of record prior  to admittance to the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you are a street name stockholder, you will be asked to provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the Record  Date, such as a brokerage account statement, a copy of the Notice or voting instruction card provided by the broker, bank or other nominee that is the stockholder of record, or other similar evidence of beneficial ownership, as well as proof of  identification, for admission. If you wish to be able to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot at the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Registration will begin at 9:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time on the date of the Annual Meeting. If you do not  provide proof of identification and comply with the other procedures outlined above, you may not be admitted to the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may contact us at (408) 753-4000 for directions to the Annual  Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
How do I vote? 
If you are a street name stockholder, there are four ways to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by Internet at http://www.proxyvote.com, 24 hours a day, seven days a week (have your proxy card in hand when you  visit the website);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by toll-free telephone at 1-800-690-6903 until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, on December 6, 2018 (have your proxy card in hand when you call);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by completing and mailing your proxy card so it is received prior to the Annual Meeting (if you received printed  proxy materials); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by written ballot at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
- 2 - 
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you also vote by proxy so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a street name stockholder, you will receive voting instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee. You must follow the voting instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee in order to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares. Street name stockholders should generally be able to vote by returning a voting instruction form, or by telephone or on the Internet. However, the availability of telephone and Internet voting will depend on the voting process of your broker, bank or other nominee. As discussed above, if you are a street name stockholder, you may not vote your shares live at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. 
Can I change my vote? 
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you can change your vote or revoke your proxy any time before the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• entering a new vote by Internet or by telephone;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• returning a later-dated proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• notifying the Corporate Secretary of Palo Alto Networks, in writing, at the address listed on the front page of  this proxy statement; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• completing a written ballot at the Annual Meeting (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself,  revoke a proxy).  
[END TABLE]
If you are a street name stockholder, your broker, bank or other nominee can provide you with instructions on how to change your vote or revoke your proxy. 
What is the effect of giving a proxy? 
Proxies are solicited by and on behalf of our board of directors. The persons named in the proxy have been designated as proxies by our board of directors. When a proxy card is properly dated, executed and returned, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instruction of the stockholder. If a proxy card is signed, but no specific instructions are given, the shares represented by such proxy card will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors, as described above. If any matters not described in this proxy statement are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the proxy holders will use their own judgment to determine how to vote the shares subject to proxies. If the Annual Meeting is adjourned, the proxy holders can vote your shares subject to proxies when the Annual Meeting is rescheduled, unless you have properly revoked your proxy instructions, as described above. 
Why did I receive the Notice instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we have elected to furnish our proxy materials, including this proxy statement and our annual report, primarily via the Internet. The Notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials is first being mailed on or about October 22, 2018 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders may request to receive all future proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail by following the instructions contained in the Notice. We encourage stockholders to take advantage of the availability of our proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings of stockholders. 
What is a quorum? 
A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present for the Annual Meeting to be properly held under our amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law. The presence, in person or by proxy, of a 
- 3 - 
 majority of all issued and outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. A proxy submitted by a stockholder may indicate that all or a portion of the shares represented by the proxy are not being voted ("stockholder withholding") with respect to a particular matter. Similarly, a broker may not be permitted to vote shares held in street name on a particular matter in the absence of instructions from the beneficial owner of such shares ("broker non-vote"). See the section titled "How may my broker, bank or other nominee vote my shares if I fail to timely provide voting instructions?" The shares of our common stock subject to a proxy that are not being voted on a particular matter because of either stockholder withholding or a broker non-vote will count for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Abstentions are also counted in the determination of a quorum. 
How many votes are needed for approval of each proposal? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal No. 1: The election of directors requires a plurality vote of the shares of  our common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon to be approved. "Plurality" means that the nominees who receive the largest number of votes cast "for" such nominees are elected as  directors. As a result, any shares not voted "for" a particular nominee (whether as a result of stockholder abstention or a broker non-vote) will not be counted in such nominee's favor and will  have no effect on the outcome of the election. You may vote "for" or "withhold" on each of the nominees for election as a director.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal No. 2: The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as  our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote  thereon to be approved. You may vote "for," "against," or "abstain" with respect to this proposal. Abstentions are considered votes present and entitled to vote on this proposal, and thus will have the same effect as a  vote "against" this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal No. 3: The approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named  executive officers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon to be approved. You may vote "for," "against,"  or "abstain" with respect to this proposal. Abstentions are considered votes present and entitled to vote on this proposal, and thus will have the same effect as votes "against" this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Although the advisory vote is non-binding, our board of directors values stockholders' opinions. The  compensation committee will review the results of the vote and, consistent with our record of stockholder responsiveness, consider stockholders' concerns and take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future decisions concerning  our executive compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal No. 4: A plurality of the votes cast is required to determine, on an advisory  basis, our stockholders' preference regarding the frequency of holding future advisory votes on executive compensation. You may indicate whether you would prefer an advisory vote on executive compensation every "1 year," "2  years" or "3 years", or you may "abstain" from voting on the proposal. The frequency—one year, two years or three years—receiving the highest number of votes will be the frequency of holding future advisory votes  on executive compensation recommended by our stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
How are proxies solicited for the Annual Meeting? 
Our board of directors is soliciting proxies for use at the Annual Meeting. All expenses associated with this solicitation will be borne by us. We will reimburse brokers, banks or other nominees for reasonable expenses that they incur in sending our proxy materials to you if a broker, bank or other nominee holds your shares of our common stock. In addition to using the internet, our directors, officers and employees may solicit proxies in 
- 4 - 
 person and by mail, telephone, facsimile, or electronic transmission, for which they will not receive any additional compensation. We have retained Saratoga Proxy Consulting LLC to assist us in soliciting proxies for a fee of approximately $10,000, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the process of soliciting proxies. 
How may my broker, bank or other nominee vote my shares if I fail to timely provide voting instructions? 
Brokerage firms, banks or other nominees holding shares of our common stock in street name for beneficial owners are generally required to vote such shares in the manner directed by the beneficial owner. In the absence of timely directions, your broker, bank or other nominee will have discretion to vote your shares on our sole "routine" matter, the proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2019. Your broker will not have discretion to vote on any other proposals, which are "non-routine" matters, absent direction from you. 
Is my vote confidential? 
Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within Palo Alto Networks or to third parties, except as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, or to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. Occasionally, stockholders provide written comments on their proxy cards, which may be forwarded to management and our board of directors. 
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. We will also disclose voting results on a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days after the Annual Meeting, we will file a Current Report on Form 8-K to publish preliminary voting results and will provide the final voting results in an amendment to the Current Report on Form 8-K as soon as they become available. 
I share an address with another stockholder, and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials. How may I obtain an additional copy of the proxy materials? 
We have adopted a procedure called "householding," which the SEC has approved. Under this procedure, we deliver a single copy of the Notice, and if applicable, our proxy materials, to multiple stockholders who share the same address unless we receive contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders sharing the same address. This procedure reduces our printing costs, mailing costs, and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate copies of the Notice, or if applicable, our proxy materials. Upon written or oral request, we will deliver promptly separate copies of the Notice and, if applicable, our proxy materials, to any stockholder at a shared address which we delivered a single copy of any of these materials. To receive a separate copy, or, if a stockholder is receiving multiple copies, to request that we only send a single copy of the Notice or, if applicable, our proxy materials, stockholders may contact us at the following: Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Attention: Investor Relations, 3000 Tannery Way, Santa Clara, California 95054 or Tel: (408) 753-4000. 
Stockholders who hold shares of our common stock in street name may contact their brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization to request information about householding.

What is the deadline to propose actions for consideration at next year's annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate individuals to serve as directors? 
Stockholder Proposals 
Stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at the next annual meeting of stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing to our Corporate Secretary in a timely manner. For a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, our Corporate Secretary must receive the written proposal at our principal executive offices not later than August 9, 2019. In addition, stockholder proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. Stockholder proposals should be addressed to: 
Palo Alto Networks, Inc., Attention: Corporate Secretary, 3000 Tannery Way, Santa Clara, California 95054. 
Our amended and restated bylaws also establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders who wish to present a proposal before an annual meeting of stockholders but do not intend for the proposal to be included in our proxy statement.

PROPOSAL NO. 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our business affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors, which is currently composed of twelve members. Nine of our directors are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and SEC rules and regulations. Our board of directors is divided into three staggered classes of directors. At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors will be elected for a three-year term to succeed the same class whose term is then expiring. 
Each director's term continues until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or such director's earlier death, resignation, or removal. Any increase or decrease in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of our directors. This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company. 
Stanley J. Meresman, one of our Class I directors, informed us on September 19, 2018, that he is not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting. We thank Mr. Meresman for his service to our company and board of directors. 
The names and certain other information as of October 22, 2018 for each of the nominees for election as a director, for each of the continuing members of the board of directors and for Mr. Meresman are set forth below.

Director Independence 
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE. Under the listing standards of the NYSE, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company's board of directors. In addition, the listing standards of the NYSE require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent. Under the listing standards of the NYSE, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of that listed company's board of directors, that director does not have a material relationship with the listed company, either directly or indirectly, that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
Audit committee members must also satisfy the additional independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and the listing standards of the NYSE. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of a listed company's audit committee may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. 
Compensation committee members must also satisfy the additional independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and the listing standards of the NYSE. In order for a member of a listed company's compensation committee to be considered independent for purposes of the listing standards of the NYSE, the listed company's board of directors must consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to the listed company that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including, 
- 12 - 
 but not limited to: (1) the source of compensation of such director, including any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee paid by the listed company to such director; and (2) whether such director is affiliated with the listed company, a subsidiary of the listed company, or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the listed company. 
Our board of directors has undertaken a review of the independence of each of our directors. Based on information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment, and affiliations, our board of directors has determined that Ms. McCarthy and each of Messrs. Calderoni, Chandna, Donovan, Eschenbach, Goetz, Meresman, Ramaswamy and Warmenhoven do not have a material relationship with our company, either directly or indirectly, that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE. In making these determinations, our board of directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each non-employee director and the transactions involving them described in the section titled "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions." 
Since the beginning of our last fiscal year through October 15, 2018, both directly and through our channel partners, we have sold an aggregate of approximately $29.7 million, $0.7 million and $0.2 million of products and services to AT&T Inc. ("AT&T"), Anaplan, Inc. ("Anaplan") and Sequoia Capital Operations, LLC ("Sequoia"), respectively, in arm's length transactions. In addition, since the beginning of our last fiscal year through October 15, 2018, we have purchased an aggregate of approximately $0.1 million, $0.4 million and $7.4 million of AT&T, Anaplan and Google, Inc. products and services, respectively, in arm's length transactions. 
We entered into these commercial dealings in the ordinary course of our business. In making the determinations as to which members of our board of directors are independent, our board of directors considered the fact that Mr. Donovan, one of our directors, is an executive officer of AT&T, that Mr. Calderoni, one of our directors, is an executive officer at Anaplan, that Mr. Ramaswamy, one of our directors, was an executive at Google until October 2018, and that Mr. Eschenbach is a partner and Mr. Goetz is a member at Sequoia. In reviewing these relationships, our board of directors determined these relationships, respectively, do not impede the ability of Messrs. Donovan, Calderoni, Ramaswamy, Eschenbach or Goetz to act independently on our behalf and on behalf of our stockholders. 
Additionally, none of Messrs. Donovan, Calderoni, Ramaswamy, Eschenbach or Goetz take part in the discussion of transactions with AT&T, Anaplan, Google, or Sequoia, respectively, when such transactions are reviewed by our board of directors. Additionally, AT&T expects its 2018 net capital expenditures to be in the $22 billion range. AT&T's purchases of our products and services, which totaled $29.7 million since the beginning of our last fiscal year through October 15, 2018, are not material to either us or AT&T. All transactions with AT&T, Anaplan, Google and Sequoia are subject to our rigorous related party transactions review process and policy. 
Leadership Structure 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that our board of directors is free to choose its chairperson (the "Chairman") based on the board of directors' view of what is in the best interest Palo Alto Networks and its stockholders. The Chairman and Chief Executive may, but need not be, the same person. Mr. McLaughlin served as our Chairman of and Chief Executive Officer until June 2018 when he resigned as Chief Executive Officer and became Vice Chairman of our board of directors. In June 2018, Mr. Arora was hired as our Chief Executive Officer to replace Mr. McLaughlin and was unanimously appointed as our Chairman. 
Our board of directors believes that our board leadership structure, coupled with a strong emphasis on board independence, provides effective independent oversight of management while allowing our board of directors 
- 13 - 
 and management to benefit from each of Mr. McLaughlin's and Mr. Arora's leadership and years of experience as executives in the technology industry. Based on Mr. Arora's executive experience in the technology industry, as well as his management capabilities and leadership experience, our board of directors believes Mr. Arora is the director most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities, leading critical discussion and guiding the formulation of our strategy and business plans as Chairman following Mr. McLaughlin's resignation. Independent directors and management sometimes have different perspectives and roles in strategy development. Our independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from outside of our company, while Mr. Arora's combined role enables strong leadership, creates clear accountability, and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and consistently to stockholders. 
Lead Independent Director 
Our corporate governance guidelines provide that one of our independent directors should serve as a Lead Independent Director at any time when our Chief Executive Officer serves as the Chairman of our board of directors or if our Chairman is not otherwise independent. Because our former and current Chief Executive Officers, Mr. McLaughlin and Mr. Arora, respectively, served and serve as our Chairman, our board of directors has appointed Mr. Warmenhoven to serve as our Lead Independent Director. As our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Warmenhoven presides over periodic meetings of our independent directors, serves as a liaison between our Chairman and the independent directors and performs such additional duties as our board of directors may otherwise determine and delegate. 
Board Effectiveness; Director Assessment; Board Education 
It is important that our board of directors and its committees are performing effectively and in the best interest of Palo Alto Networks and its stockholders. Our board of directors performs an annual self-assessment, overseen by the nominating and corporate governance committee, to evaluate its effectiveness in fulfilling its obligations. Directors are sent questions by our outside legal counsel covering board of directors, committee, self and peer performance. Our outside legal counsel then interviews each director to obtain his or her assessment of the effectiveness of our board of directors and committees, as well as director performance and board of directors' dynamics, summarizes these individual assessments for discussion with the board of directors and committees, and leads a discussion with the nominating and corporate governance committee and the board of directors. The board of directors then takes such further action as it deems appropriate. In addition, we encourage directors to participate in continuing education programs focused on our business and industry, committee roles and responsibilities, and legal and ethical responsibilities of directors and we reimburse directors for their expenses associated with this participation. We also encourage our directors to attend Palo Alto Networks events such as our annual Ignite conference. Continuing director education is also provided during board meetings and other board discussions as part of the formal meetings and may include internally developed materials and presentations as well as programs presented by third parties. 
Board Meetings and Committees 
During our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the board of directors held eleven meetings (including regularly scheduled and special meetings), and no director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of the board of directors and the committees of which he or she was a member. 
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of our board of directors at annual meetings of stockholders, we encourage, but do not require, our directors to attend. Eight of our eleven directors at the time attended our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, either telephonically or in person. 
Our board of directors has an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each of which has the composition and responsibilities described below. Directors serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our board of directors. All of the 
- 14 - 
 directors on the standing committees of our board of directors are independent, and each of these committees is led by a committee chairperson. 
Audit Committee 
Our audit committee consists of Ms. McCarthy and Messrs. Calderoni, Donovan and Meresman, with Mr. Meresman serving as the chair until the Annual Meeting.

Each member of our audit committee also meets the financial literacy and sophistication requirements of the listing standards of the NYSE. In addition, our board of directors has determined that each of Ms. McCarthy and Messrs. Calderoni and Meresman are "audit committee financial experts" within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the SEC. Our audit committee is responsible for, among other things:

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of the members of our compensation committee is or has been an officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee (or other board committee performing equivalent functions) of any entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee. 
Considerations in Evaluating Director Nominees 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee uses a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director nominees. In its evaluation of director candidates, our nominating and corporate governance committee will consider the current size and composition of our board of directors and the needs of our board of directors and the respective committees of our board of directors. Some of the qualifications that our nominating 
- 16 - 
 and corporate governance committee considers include, without limitation, issues of character, integrity, judgment, diversity (including gender and race), experience of particular relevance to us and the board of directors, independence, age, area of expertise, length of service, potential conflicts of interest and other commitments. These factors may be weighted differently depending on the individual being considered or the needs of the board of directors at the time. 
Nominees must also have the ability to offer advice and guidance to our Chief Executive Officer based on past experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility and be leaders in the companies or institutions with which they are affiliated. Director candidates must have sufficient time available in the judgment of our nominating and corporate governance committee to perform all board of director and committee responsibilities. Members of our board of directors are expected to prepare for, attend, and actively participate in all board of director and applicable committee meetings. Given the significant time commitment that board membership requires, our board of directors generally believes that no director should be a member of more than three public company boards. Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although our nominating and corporate governance committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem, from time to time, are in our and our stockholders' best interests. Our nominating and corporate governance committee will also seek appropriate input from our Chief Executive Officer from time to time in assessing the needs of our board of directors for relevant background, experience, diversity and skills of its members. 
Our board of directors should be a diverse body, with varying perspectives and experiences. Our nominating and corporate governance committee considers diversity (whether based on broader principles such as diversity of perspective, experiences, and expertise, as well as factors commonly associated with diversity such as gender, race or national origin) in connection with its evaluation of director candidates, including the evaluation and determination of whether to re-nominate incumbent directors. Our nominating and corporate governance committee also considers these and other factors as it oversees the annual board of director and committee evaluations. The nominating and corporate governance committee is committed to seeking out qualified and diverse director candidates, including women and individuals from minority groups, to include in the pool from which director candidates are chosen. Any search firm retained by our nominating and corporate governance committee to find director candidates would be instructed to take into account all of the considerations used by our nominating and corporate governance committee including diversity. After completing its review and evaluation of director candidates, our nominating and corporate governance committee recommends to our full board of directors the director nominees for selection. 
Stockholder Recommendations for Nominations to the Board of Directors 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee will consider candidates for director recommended by stockholders holding at least one percent (1%) of the fully diluted capitalization of our company continuously for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the submission of the recommendation, so long as such recommendations comply with our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and applicable laws, rules and regulations, including those promulgated by the SEC. The nominating and corporate governance committee will evaluate such recommendations in accordance with its charter, our amended and restated bylaws, our policies and procedures for director candidates, as well as the regular director nominee criteria described above. This process is designed to ensure that our board of directors includes members with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience, including appropriate financial and other expertise relevant to our business. Eligible stockholders wishing to recommend a candidate for nomination should contact our Corporate Secretary in writing. Such recommendations must include information about the candidate, a statement of support by the recommending stockholder, evidence of the recommending stockholder's ownership of our common stock and a signed letter from the candidate confirming willingness to serve on our board of directors. Our nominating and corporate governance committee has discretion to decide which individuals to recommend for nomination as directors. 
- 17 - 
Stockholder Nominations to the Board of Directors 
Under our amended and restated bylaws, a stockholder may nominate one or more persons for our board of directors for inclusion in the stockholder's proxy materials. Any such nomination must comply with the requirements set forth in our amended and restated bylaws and recommendations should be sent in writing to our Corporate Secretary at Palo Alto Networks, Inc., 3000 Tannery Way, Santa Clara, California 95054. 
Under our amended and restated bylaws, eligible stockholders may also nominate persons for our board of directors for inclusion in our proxy statement. This is commonly known as "proxy access." To be eligible, a single stockholder, or group of up to 20 stockholders, must own 3% of our outstanding stock for at least three years consecutively. The individual stockholder, or group of stockholders, may submit that number of director nominations not exceeding the greater of (a) two or (b) 20% of the number of directors in office. Any such nomination must comply with the requirements set forth in our amended and restated bylaws and recommendations should be sent in writing to our Corporate Secretary at Palo Alto Networks, Inc., 3000 Tannery Way, Santa Clara, California 95054. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Interested parties wishing to communicate with our board of directors or with an individual member or members of our board of directors may do so by writing to the board of directors or to the particular member or members of our board of directors, and mailing the correspondence to our General Counsel or our Legal Department, at Palo Alto Networks, Inc., 3000 Tannery Way, Santa Clara, California 95054. Our General Counsel or our Legal Department, in consultation with appropriate members of our board of directors, as necessary, will review all incoming communications and, if appropriate, all such communications will be forwarded to the appropriate member or members of our board of directors, or if none is specified, to the Chairman of our board of directors. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
Our board of directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines address items such as the qualifications and responsibilities of our directors and director candidates and corporate governance policies and standards applicable to us in general. In addition, our board of directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other executive and senior financial officers. The full text of our Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on the Investor Information portion of our website at http://investors.paloaltonetworks.com/. We will post amendments to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or waivers of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors and executive officers on the same website. 
Risk Management 
Risk is inherent with every business, and we face a number of risks, including strategic, financial, business and operational, legal and compliance, and reputational. We have designed and implemented processes to manage risk in our operations. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks our company faces, while our board of directors, as a whole and assisted by its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, our board of directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are appropriate and functioning as designed. 
Our board of directors believes that open communication between management and our board of directors is essential for effective risk management and oversight. Our board of directors meets with our Chief Executive Officer and other members of the senior management team at quarterly meetings of our board of directors, where, among other topics, they discuss strategy and risks facing our company, as well as at such other times as they deem appropriate. 
- 18 - 
While our board of directors is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, our board committees assist our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. Our audit committee assists our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to risk management in the areas of liquidity risk, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, legal and regulatory compliance, and discusses with management and the independent auditor guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. Our audit committee also reviews our major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. Our nominating and corporate governance committee assists our board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risk associated with board organization, membership and structure, and corporate governance. Our compensation committee assesses risks created by the incentives inherent in our compensation programs and policies. Finally, our board of directors reviews strategic and operational risk in the context of reports from the management team, including data privacy and cybersecurity, receives reports on all significant committee activities at each regular meeting, and evaluates the risks inherent in significant transactions. 
Succession Planning 
Our board of directors and management team recognize the importance of continually developing our talented employee base. Accordingly, our management team conducts an annual talent review of the current senior leadership positions. In addition, our CEO annually reviews a succession plan for the CEO position, using formal criteria to evaluate potential internal and external successors and also interim candidates in the event of an emergency situation. In conducting its evaluation, our board of directors considers organizational needs, competitive challenges, leadership/management potential and development, and emergency situations. 
As part of our succession planning, on June 6, 2018, Mr. Arora became our Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Mr. McLaughlin, who resigned after nearly seven years as Chief Executive Officer. Mr. McLaughlin continues to serve as Vice Chairman of the board of directors. Additionally, on November 22, 2017, Ms. Bonanno was promoted to Chief Financial Officer after Mr. Tomlinson had notified us of his intent to retire after serving as our Chief Financial Officer for a little over six years. These transitions exemplify the board's ongoing commitment to recruiting, cultivating and developing executive talent to meet our company's organizational and strategic needs. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our board of directors believes that our directors and executive officers should hold a meaningful financial stake in our company in order to further align their interests with those of our stockholders and therefore adopted stock ownership guidelines in fiscal 2017. Under the guidelines, each non-employee director must own the lesser of (i) company stock with a value of three times the annual cash retainer for board service or (ii) 6,875 shares. Our non-employee directors are required to achieve ownership of our common stock within five years of the later of August 26, 2016 or such director's appointment or election date as applicable. 
See the section titled "Discussion of our Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program—Other Compensation Policies—Stock Ownership and Compensation Recovery Policies" for additional details on our executive ownership guidelines. 
Director Compensation 
Our nominating and corporate governance committee has approved a policy for the compensation of the non-employee members of our board of directors (the "Director Compensation Policy") to attract, retain, and reward these individuals and align their financial interests with those of our stockholders. Only non-employee directors who are not affiliated with investment funds that hold shares of our common stock are eligible for compensation under the Director Compensation Policy. There is no cash compensation paid under the Director Compensation Policy. 
- 19 - 
Initial Award. Under the Director Compensation Policy, when an eligible director initially joins our board of directors, the eligible director receives an initial award of restricted stock units having a value of $1 million (as determined based on the average closing price of our common stock on the NYSE during the 30 calendar days prior to the date of grant). This initial award will vest as to one third of the shares covered by the restricted stock unit award on the first anniversary of the date the eligible director joined our board of directors, and the remaining shares will vest quarterly over the following two years, subject to the director's continued service as of each such date. 
Annual Award. Under the Director Compensation Policy, at each annual meeting of stockholders, each eligible director receives an annual restricted stock unit award having a value equal to $300,000 (as determined based on the average closing price of our common stock on the NYSE during the 30 calendar days prior to the date of grant). In addition, at each annual meeting of stockholders, our Lead Independent Director receives an additional annual restricted stock unit award having a value equal to $50,000 (as determined based on the average closing price of our common stock on the NYSE during the 30 calendar days prior to the date of grant). All annual awards, including the annual awards to the lead independent director, will vest quarterly over a period of one year, subject to the director's continued service as of each such date. 
Committee Awards. At each annual meeting of stockholders, the chairpersons and members of the three standing committees of our board of directors will receive additional annual restricted stock unit awards for committee service having the following values (as determined based on the average closing price of our common stock on the NYSE during the 30 calendar days prior to the date of grant): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board Committee    Chairperson Retainer ($)      Member Retainer ($)

 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee      15,000        10,000   
[END TABLE]
Any eligible director who serves as chairperson of a committee is not entitled to a member retainer for the same committee. The committee awards will vest quarterly over a period of one year, subject to the director's continued service as of each such date.

Workforce Diversity 
We are committed to diversity in our workforce and recognize diversity as a business imperative. An inclusive and diverse culture is vital to the continued growth of our company. The board of directors continuously oversees our diversity efforts and monitors our progress toward increasing diversity. 
In 2017, we received a stockholder proposal requesting, among other things, disclosure of various information relating to the diversity of our workforce. At the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a substantial number of our stockholders supported this proposal. 
As part of our stockholder engagement efforts, members of our management team and our Lead Independent Director reached out to our top institutional and other stockholders representing an aggregate of approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock to better understand their perspectives on workforce diversity and the type of information that these stockholders believed would be most appropriate for us to disclose. In general, stockholders agreed on the importance of a diverse workforce. They expressed varying perspectives on the type and nature of disclosure that they preferred us to provide. In addition, stockholders were supportive of making this disclosure in a measured fashion. 
We are committed to expanding our inclusion and diversity initiatives and publicly sharing our workforce diversity data. In 2018, in response to both the stockholder proposal described above and our conversations with stockholders, we began to provide a significant amount of information on our website concerning the diversity of our workforce. For example, we now publicly disclose our EEO-1 form. An EEO-1 form is a report filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that describes the racial, ethnic and gender composition of our workforce. This form, along with a chart that shows the information graphical, is available at https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/company/about-us/inclusion-diversity. 
We are proud of our responsiveness to stockholders on this important issue. We will continue to monitor the diversity of our workforce and ways that we can communicate our efforts in this area to stockholders. 
Gender Pay Equity 
Our conversations with stockholders also highlighted the importance of gender pay equity. We agree that this is an important topic. We are committed to equal pay. Throughout our company, we strive to ensure that our compensation is fair and equitable. We are committed to eliminating unexplainable differences in pay and have made pay equity analyses part of our yearly review process. As a result, we have taken steps to successfully address pay gaps globally. As with workforce diversity, we will continue to monitor this important issue and appropriately communicate our efforts.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our audit committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"), independent registered public accountants, to audit our financial statements for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2019. During our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, EY served as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending July 31, 2019. Our audit committee is submitting the selection of EY to our stockholders because we value our stockholders views on our independent registered public accounting firm and as a matter of good corporate governance. Representatives of EY will be present at the Annual Meeting, and they will have an opportunity to make statements and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from our stockholders. 
Notwithstanding the selection of EY and even if our stockholders ratify the selection, our audit committee, in its discretion, may appoint another independent registered public accounting firm at any time during our fiscal year if our audit committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of Palo Alto Networks and its stockholders. If our stockholders do not ratify the appointment of EY, our board of directors may reconsider the appointment. 
Fees Paid to the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The following table presents fees for professional audit services and other services rendered to our company by EY for our fiscal years ended July 31, 2017 and 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees (1)    $ 3,654,504      $ 5,469,185

The increase  in Audit Fees in fiscal 2018 is primarily due to an increase in the scope of the integrated audit related to (1) ASC 606 implementation and related disclosures, (2) an increase in acquisition activity in fiscal 2018, and (3) the  issuance of our 0.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023.

Auditor Independence 
In our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, there were no other professional services provided by EY that would have required our audit committee to consider their compatibility with maintaining the independence of EY. 
Audit Committee Policy on Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Consistent with requirements of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") regarding auditor independence, our audit committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, our audit committee has established a policy for the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. 
Before engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, the independent registered public accounting firm submits a detailed description of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of the following categories of services to our audit committee for approval: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit services. Audit services include work performed for the audit of our financial statements and the  review of financial statements included in our quarterly reports, as well as work that is normally provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit related services. Audit related services are for assurance and related services that are reasonably  related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not covered above under "audit services."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tax services. Tax services include all services performed by the independent registered public accounting  firm's tax personnel for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other services. Other services are those services not described in the other categories.   
[END TABLE]
Our audit committee pre-approves particular services or categories of services on a case-by-case basis. The fees are budgeted, and our audit committee requires our independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus budgeted fees periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, before our independent registered public accounting firm is engaged, the services must be pre-approved by our audit committee or approved by the chair of the audit committee and later ratified by the audit committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels or amounts require specific pre-approval by our audit committee. All fees paid to EY for our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, were pre-approved by our audit committee.

With respect to the company's financial reporting process, the management of the company is responsible for (1) establishing and maintaining internal controls and (2) preparing the company's consolidated financial statements. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"), is responsible for auditing these financial statements. It is the responsibility of the audit committee to oversee these activities. It is not the responsibility of the audit committee to prepare or certify our financial statements or guarantee the audits or reports of the independent auditors. These are the fundamental responsibilities of management and our independent registered public accounting firm. 
The audit committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work performed by EY. In fulfilling its oversight responsibility, the audit committee carefully reviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters, performance of the independent auditors, and the extent to which the independent registered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit services. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the audit committee has: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and EY;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discussed with EY the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 16, as  amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1. AU section 380), and as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T;

Based on the audit committee's review and discussions with management and EY, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
In accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are providing our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory or non-binding basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC in the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation as a whole. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific named executive officer, but rather the overall compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. 
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore is not binding on us, our compensation committee or our board of directors. The say-on-pay vote will, however, provide information to us regarding investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices, which our compensation committee will be able to consider when determining executive compensation for the remainder of the current fiscal year and beyond. Our board of directors and our compensation committee value the opinions of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will endeavor to communicate with stockholders to better understand the concerns that influenced the vote and consider our stockholders' concerns and our compensation committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. We currently conduct advisory votes on our named executive officer compensation on an annual basis, and we expect to conduct our next advisory vote at our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. 
We believe that the information we have provided in the section titled "Executive Compensation," and in particular the information discussed in the section titled "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis," demonstrates that our executive compensation program has been designed appropriately and is working to ensure management's interests are aligned with our stockholders' interests to support long-term value creation. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that Palo Alto Networks, Inc.'s stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in Palo Alto Networks, Inc.'s proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and narrative discussion, and other related disclosure." 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN 
ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
- 26 - 
PROPOSAL NO. 4 
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF 
ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
Stockholders have the opportunity to advise the board of directors, on an advisory or non-binding basis, whether we should conduct an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve named executive officer compensation every one, two or three years. 
While our compensation strategies are related to both short-term and longer-term business outcomes, we realize that compensation decisions are made annually. We also believe that an annual advisory vote on named executive officer compensation will give us more frequent feedback on our compensation disclosures and named executive officer compensation program. The board of directors has determined that holding an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every year continues to be the most appropriate policy for us at this time, and recommends that stockholders vote for future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation to occur each year. 
The frequency that receives the highest number of votes cast will be deemed to be the frequency selected by the stockholders. Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the board of directors. However, the compensation committee and the board of directors will consider the outcome of the stockholder vote, along with other relevant factors, in recommending and determining, respectively, a voting frequency to our board of directors. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR A FREQUENCY OF ONCE EVERY "ONE YEAR" 
FOR THE ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

Executive Summary 
Our goal is to align our executive pay with the success of our business and our compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain the key executives who drive our continued success. We do this by providing short-term cash incentive compensation opportunities tied to successful achievement of our annual operating goals and by granting long-term incentive compensation opportunities in the form of equity awards that are intended to deliver increasing value as our stock price increases, including performance-based equity awards tied to our financial and operational performance. 
Our executive compensation program continues to evolve as we mature, gain market share and grow, at scale, faster than the competition and the rate of the market. Beginning in fiscal 2017, our compensation committee made significant changes to our executive compensation program by structuring the program to include performance-based stock awards tied to our financial performance, which was intended to enhance the link between executive pay and our financial and operational performance, create value for our stockholders, increase market alignment and mitigate risk, as well as respond to stockholder feedback on our compensation practices. 
In fiscal 2018, our compensation committee continued this evolution by structuring our executive compensation program to include long-term performance-based compensation that is aligned with achievement of our business strategy and creates value for our stockholders. Similarly, when designing a competitive total compensation package for our new Chief Executive Officer, the goal of our compensation committee was to provide a compensation package that had a significant portion that would deliver value to him only if other 
- 30 - 
 stockholders realize significant value as well. Mr. Arora's compensation package is discussed separately from the remainder of the discussion of the compensation of other executives and was designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  align his interests with our long-term priorities and our stockholders  through the grant of a time-based restricted stock unit award having an approximate value of $40,000,000 that will vest quarterly over a seven-year period with nothing vesting during the first year (which is a significantly longer vesting period  than our customary time-based restricted stock unit awards);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  ensure that he made a significant cash investment in our common stock by structuring a portion of his equity  compensation contingent upon his purchase of $20,000,000 in shares of our common stock within 30 days of his employment start date; and

  (3)  be heavily performance-weighted to link his equity compensation to the creation of significant value for our  stockholders during the next seven years.

Fiscal 2018 Business Highlights 
Our executive compensation program is designed to align the compensation of our executive officers with our financial and operational performance (both short-term and long-term) and create sustainable value for our stockholders. Our executive compensation actions and decisions should be viewed in the context of our financial and operational performance during fiscal 2018, as shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Dollars in millions    Fiscal 2017      Fiscal 2018      Change   
 Total Revenue    $ 1,761.6      $ 2,273.1        29.0%  
 Net Cash provided by Operating Activities      868.5        1,037.0        19.4%  
 Total Deferred Revenue      1,773.5        2,364.9        33.3%  
 Billings      2,293.4        2,860.2        24.7%  
 Approximate Number of Customers      42,500        54,000        27.1%  
[END TABLE]
Although net cash provided by operating activities, deferred revenue, billings and number of customers are not measures that were used to determine awards under our incentive compensation plans, we believe that these results are important to provide context because these measures are useful indicators for our compensation committee of our ability to grow our business consistent with our annual operating plan as it considers the compensation of our executive officers. Billings is a key financial measure and the calculation of billings to revenue is set forth in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section on page 37 and 38 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on September 13, 2018. Note that the billings described in the table above is not the applicable billings measure used for purposes of our performance-based stock awards. For purposes of our performance-based stock awards, we make certain adjustments to billings to exclude inorganic items such as post-acquisition billings from M&A.

Strong Revenue Growth (in millions) 
Executive Compensation Practices 
Our executive compensation program is designed to be heavily weighted towards compensating our executive officers based on our financial and operational performance. To that end, we have implemented executive compensation policies and practices that reinforce our "pay for performance" philosophy and align with sound governance principles. During fiscal 2018, the following policies and practices were in place: 
What we do: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short-term cash incentive compensation that is performance-based and entirely  at-risk  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 100% independent directors on our compensation committee  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent compensation consultant directly engaged by and reporting to our compensation committee

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-based equity incentive awards that are entirely at-risk  
[END TABLE]

• Meaningful stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers and directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting schedules no less than four years for our service-based equity incentive awards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Have the ability to seek the recovery of performance-based incentive compensation paid by us under a Clawback  Policy (implemented in fiscal 2018)  
[END TABLE]
What we do not do: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Do not have "single trigger" change in control payments or benefits  
[END TABLE]
- 32 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Do not have Post-employment retirement- or pension-type benefits for our executive officers that are not  available to our employees generally

[END TABLE]

• Do not permit hedging or pledging of shares of our common stock  
[END TABLE]
Stockholder Engagement and our 2017 Say-on-Pay Vote 
Our compensation committee considers a number of factors in making executive compensation decisions, including the growth and scale of our business; recent performance against financial targets; a measured analysis of the compensation practices of the companies in our compensation peer group and other market data; an analysis of competitive market conditions by its external compensation consultant; the value of each executive's position; the skills, tenure, and experience of our executives; the alignment between the market based positions and the actual responsibilities of our executives; each executive's performance; our executives' expected future contributions; the incentives provided to our executives to stay with us and drive our continued growth; prior to our former Chief Executive Officer's resignation, his recommendations (except with respect to his own compensation); internal parity considerations; the value of each executive's unvested equity holdings; the dilutive effect of our long-term incentive compensation program; and the overall impact that our executives' compensation would have on stockholder value. 
Our compensation committee also considers the results of each annual stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our NEOs (the "Say-on-Pay" vote) and stockholder feedback on our executive compensation program. As part of our regular, ongoing and transparent communications with our stockholders, we engage with our stockholders on a variety of topics through quarterly earnings calls, financial conferences, non-deal road shows and other communication channels. These discussions are generally attended by a combination of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Lead Independent Director (who serves on our compensation committee), General Counsel and/or Investor Relations lead. 
At the beginning of fiscal 2018, prior to our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our management team reached out to our top institutional and other stockholders representing an aggregate of approximately 25% of our outstanding shares of common stock to discuss their views about our executive compensation program, policies and practices as well as other matters. The stockholder engagement during fiscal 2018 was both targeted and extensive, similar to our practice in prior years. 
In the course of these discussions, we received valuable feedback on our executive compensation program, policies and practices. The feedback received was presented to our nominating and corporate governance committee, compensation committee and board of directors. We also received favorable comments from our stockholders concerning the introduction of performance-based stock awards to our executive compensation program. We believe that this result demonstrates that our stockholders are supportive of our executive compensation program and the significant changes our compensation committee made commencing in fiscal 2017. 
As our compensation committee has reviewed our executive compensation policies and practices since that 2017 Say-on-Pay vote in which more than 94% of the stockholders voting supported our executive compensation program, it has been mindful of the strong support our stockholders expressed for our approach to executive compensation. As a result, following our annual review of our executive compensation philosophy, our compensation committee decided to retain our general approach to executive compensation for fiscal 2018, the highlights of which are set forth in the table below and in the section entitled "Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program Decisions" below. We value the opinions of our stockholders and it is the current intent of our compensation committee to continue to engage in dialogue with our stockholders to solicit feedback throughout the year regarding our executive compensation program, policies and practices.

Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program Decisions 
Our executive compensation program continues to evolve as we mature, gain market share and grow, at scale, faster than the competition and the rate of the market. The changes to our executive compensation program, which were first introduced in fiscal 2017, as further discussed below, were designed to enhance the link between executive pay and our financial and operational performance, increase market alignment and mitigate risk, as well as respond to stockholder feedback on our compensation practices. The feedback from our stockholders, along with the evolution of our fiscal planning process as we mature as a public company, and our compensation committee's ongoing discussion about the appropriate time in our growth and evolution to implement performance-based equity awards, were factors in implementing, for the first time in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2018, performance-based equity awards tied to billings performance. 
These performance-based equity awards were granted in the form of performance-based stock awards, or PSAs, in fiscal 2017 and in the form performance-based stock unit awards, or PSUs, in fiscal 2018. Prior to fiscal 2017, we had only granted restricted stock awards, or RSAs, or restricted stock unit awards, or RSUs, subject to time-based vesting to our executive officers. For fiscal 2018, we believe that the updated executive compensation practices and governance that we introduced in fiscal 2017 continued to be appropriate for a company of our size, in our industry and our stage of growth. Further, our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program was measured against an updated set of peer companies that we annually select as we grow. 
Below is a summary of the primary features of the fiscal 2018 PSUs granted to executive officers other than Mr. Arora, along with the rationale for our approach. See the section titled "Equity Compensation" for more information.

Vesting Schedule     Four-year vesting schedule   For Mr. McLaughlin, our former Chief Executive Officer: Quarterly vesting in equal installments, so long as the performance measure is achieved and he  continues to be a service provider through each vesting date.   For executive officers  other than Mr. McLaughlin: Vesting generally weighted towards the latter three years of the service period, so long as the executive officer continues to be a service provider through each vesting date.       Additional time-based vesting requirement beyond satisfying the performance  metric provides additional long-term incentives. A total of four-years of service is required for full vesting.

As we, and the compensation program, evolve and as we evaluate, including through stockholder discussions, the usefulness of performance-based stock awards in attaining our compensation objectives, our compensation committee intends to review and reconsider the mix of components in our long-term equity compensation, the appropriateness of performance-based grants in future years, the metrics applicable to performance-based stock awards and the length of performance period for performance-based stock awards.

In addition to the fiscal 2018 PSUs, in October 2017, our compensation committee approved the structure of our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program for our executive officers, other than Mr. Arora and Ms. Bonanno, which is summarized in the chart below. In making these decisions, our compensation committee considered, among other factors, company performance, internal pay equity considerations, pay levels of these executive officers relative to the executives in comparable positions at the companies in our updated compensation peer group and the overall competitive market, the experience and responsibilities of each of these executive officers, the individual performance of each of these executive officers, the continued competition for experienced leadership in our industry and the feedback from our stockholders as discussed above.

In addition, in connection with Mr. Arora's hire and Ms. Bonanno's appointment as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, our compensation committee approved their base salaries and annual incentive compensation opportunities and granted them equity awards, as discussed in further detail below. 
Compensation Arrangements with Mr. Arora 
On June 6, 2018, Mr. Arora became our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. In hiring Mr. Arora, our board of directors approved an employment offer letter setting forth the principal terms and conditions of his employment, including an initial annualized base salary of $1,000,000 (which was set through arm's-length negotiation, considering such factors as the prevailing market conditions, market data for base salaries of chief executive officers of similarly situated companies, and his prospective role and responsibilities), which is subject to adjustment by the board of directors or compensation committee from time to time, and a target annual cash bonus opportunity of 100% of his base salary (based on the achievement of certain objectives established by the board of directors and/or our compensation committee), which, for fiscal 2018, were pro-rated 
- 36 - 
 for the portion of fiscal 2018 that Mr. Arora was employed by us. Mr. Arora's base salary was around the 60th percentile of our fiscal 2018 compensation peer group. 
In addition, Mr. Arora received the following equity awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A time-based RSU award for 198,597 shares of our common stock (the "Time-Based RSU") that will vest  over a seven-year period with one-seventh vesting after the first year and quarterly vesting thereafter, subject to Mr. Arora's continued service on each vesting date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Contingent upon Mr. Arora's purchase of $20,000,000 worth of Company common stock on the public market  within 30 days of June 6, 2018 (the "Investment Shares"), an RSU award for 95,650 shares of our common stock (the "Investment RSU"), which will vest over a four-year period with  one-fourth vesting after the first year and quarterly vesting thereafter, subject to Mr. Arora's continued service on each vesting date and his holding all of the Investment Shares through each  vesting date. If Mr. Arora ceases to hold all of the Investment Shares until June 6, 2022, he will forfeit all of the shares of our common stock subject to the Investment RSU.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A performance-based stock option to purchase 1,158,100 shares of our common stock (the "Performance  Option"). The Performance Option has a per share exercise price of $198.50 (the "Baseline Price"). Shares subject to the Performance Option become eligible to vest (the "Eligible Option Shares") upon achievement of certain  stock price targets (the "Stock Price Achievements") as set forth below:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]% of Performance Option becoming Eligible Option   Shares     Stock Price Achievement    Time to Achieve    Expiration of Option 
[END TABLE]
To the extent that Stock Price Achievements have been met, Eligible Option Shares will vest as to one-fourth (1/4) of the shares annually on each anniversary of the Performance Option grant date (June 7), subject to Mr. Arora's continued service on each vesting date. Upon a "Change in Control" (as described in below in the section entitled " —Executive Employment Agreements" and " —Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control") the price payable to Company stockholders at closing will be the final Stock Price Achievement. 
The grant date fair values of these equity awards are set forth in the "Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Fiscal 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below. 
Mr. Arora's employment offer letter was approved by our board of directors. In establishing his initial compensation arrangements, our compensation committee and board of directors took into consideration our focus on new developing markets and the requisite experience and skills that a qualified candidate would need to manage a growing business in a dynamic and ever-changing environment. In light of these goals, our compensation committee and board of directors sought a candidate who had a strong track record that demonstrated through experience that he or she could manage and grow a business at scale and could leverage that experience to take us through this next phase of growth. Based on his prior experience at Google, Inc. (where he served in positions with progressively more responsibility, including his final Google position as Senior Vice President and Chief Business Officer) and at SoftBank (where he served as SoftBank's President and Chief Operating Officer), our compensation committee and board of directors believed Mr. Arora to be the ideal candidate, as he was a proven business and technology leader who had previously demonstrated leadership and ability to scale businesses (driving the growth of Google's search business from $2 billion in revenues to over $60 billion in revenues), had significant experience with cloud platforms, software-as-a-service, analytics and large-scale systems, and would be able to leverage this experience to build relationships and strike partnerships with top cloud and software providers. 
- 37 - 
In determining his initial compensation arrangements, our compensation committee and board of directors sought to provide Mr. Arora with compensation that was competitive with the market for similar positions at other comparable companies (taking into account data provided by our compensation committee's compensation consultant) and balanced the desire to deliver a compensation package designed to provide long-term incentives with increasing value based upon achievement of a combination of market capitalization and financial operating goals that are aligned with our long-term priorities and stockholder value creation. In addition to the market data considered, our compensation committee and board of directors considered the fact that Mr. Arora was one of Google's highest paid executives and that he had received substantial compensation during his tenure at SoftBank. 
A primary consideration of the structure of this aggregate compensation package was that our compensation committee wanted to design an overall compensation package that provided its maximum value to Mr. Arora only if all other stockholders realized significant value. As such, the Performance Option award is a true "pay-for-performance" award that directly aligns Mr. Arora's interests with the interests of our stockholders. 
With respect to the other equity awards granted to Mr. Arora, the Time-Based RSU provides for a seven-year vesting schedule (significantly longer than our typical vesting schedule for time-based equity awards) and the Investment RSU required a $20 million cash investment and a minimum four-year holding period for that investment. As such, these non performance-based equity awards were carefully structured to satisfy our long-term retention objectives and require Mr. Arora to make a significant personal investment in us. In total, our compensation committee identified Mr. Arora as a candidate with unique vision and leadership qualities that it is confident will take us to the next level and created a compensation package that rewards him if he is successful in doing so. 
For a summary of the material terms and conditions of Mr. Arora's employment offer letter, including the severance and change in control payments and benefits related to the equity awards described above, see " —Executive Employment Agreements" and "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Compensation Arrangements with Ms. Bonanno 
In connection with Ms. Bonanno's appointment as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and taking into the consideration the factors described above, her base salary was increased to $425,000 and we set her target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity at 60% of her annual base salary. This resulted in her total target cash compensation being slightly above the 50th percentile of our fiscal 2018 compensation peer group. We also granted equity awards consisting of 50% RSUs and 50% PSUs to her in November 2017, which were targeted at or around the 75th percentile of our fiscal 2018 compensation peer group. 
Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
The key executive compensation decisions in fiscal 2018 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation committee approved an updated compensation peer group for fiscal 2018. This compensation peer  group was used to prepare a competitive market analysis that was used by our compensation committee to ensure that our executive compensation decisions for the year were positioned to be competitive with comparable peers in the market.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In fiscal 2018, our total revenue increased by $511.5 million and our  non-GAAP earnings per share increased by $1.28 per share compared to fiscal 2017. In light of our strong revenue and earnings per share performance in 2018, we achieved and exceeded our revenue and earnings  per share targets for our annual cash incentive compensation awards. Even though we exceeded our revenue target, our compensation committee exercised its reserved discretion and decided to pay our NEOs (other than Mr. Arora) between 116% to  117% of target on an aggregated annual basis under our Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In fiscal 2018, our billings increased by $566.8 million compared to fiscal 2017. This performance resulted  in the earning of 105.51% of the shares of our common stock subject to the Fiscal 2018 PSUs.

DISCUSSION OF OUR FISCAL 2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
This section provides an overview of our executive compensation philosophy, the overall objectives of our executive compensation program and each component of our executive compensation program. In addition, we explain how and why our compensation committee arrived at the specific compensation policies and decisions involving our executive officers for fiscal 2018. 
Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
We operate in a highly competitive business environment, which is characterized by frequent technological advances, rapidly changing market requirements and the emergence of new market entrants. To successfully grow our business in this dynamic environment, we must continually develop and refine our products and services to stay ahead of our end-customers' needs and challenges. To achieve these objectives, we need a highly talented and seasoned team of technical, sales, marketing, operations, and other business professionals. 
We compete with other companies in our industry and other technology companies in the San Francisco Bay Area to attract and retain a skilled management team. To attract and retain qualified executive candidates, our compensation committee recognizes that it needs to develop competitive compensation packages to meet this challenge. Accordingly, we have embraced a compensation philosophy of offering our NEOs a competitive total compensation program, each of the components of which recognizes and rewards individual performance and contributions to our success. This philosophy allows us to attract, retain, and motivate talented executive officers with the skills and abilities needed to drive our desired business results. The specific objectives of our executive compensation program are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward our executive officers for the successful achievement of our strategic and financial growth objectives;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• drive the development of a successful and profitable business through our next phase of growth;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, motivate, reward, and retain highly qualified executive officers who are important to our success and  possess the skills and leadership necessary to continue to grow our business through our next phase of growth;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recognize strong performers by offering cash performance-based incentive compensation and equity awards that have  the potential to reward individual achievement as well as contributions to our overall success;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide compensation packages that are competitive to peers, the overall competitive market and our performance;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• create value for our stockholders and align the interests of our executive officers with those of our  stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Program Design 
Our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018 reflected our stage of development as a growing publicly-traded company which is gaining market share and growing, at scale, faster than the competition and the rate of the market. Accordingly, we design our executive compensation program to provide market-competitive compensation in the form of base salary, an annual cash incentive compensation opportunity, a long-term incentive compensation opportunity in the form of equity awards, including both time-based RSUs and performance-based PSUs, certain employee health and welfare benefits. 
We offer cash compensation in the form of base salaries and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities (with semi-annual payouts). Typically, we have structured our annual cash incentive compensation opportunities to focus on the achievement of specific short-term financial and operational objectives that will further our longer-term growth objectives. 
- 39 - 
Additionally, equity awards for shares of our common stock serve as a key component of our executive compensation program. In fiscal 2018, we granted full value awards, or awards without a purchase price (in the form of RSUs and PSUs), to provide appropriate levels of compensation, to ensure that the recipient receives value for the shares earned regardless of fluctuations in the market price of our common stock, and to promote stockholder value creation (the value of a recipient's shares increases only as stockholder value increases). As we did with Mr. Arora's compensation package, in the future, we may introduce other forms of equity awards, as we deem appropriate, that further our objective of providing long-term incentives to our NEOs while promoting stockholder value creation. 
Finally, we offer our executive officers standard health and welfare benefits that are generally available to our other employees, including medical, dental, vision, life insurance and a Section 401(k) savings plans. 
We have not adopted any formal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between current and long-term compensation or between cash and non-cash compensation, although we use competitive market data to develop a general framework for establishing the appropriate pay mix. Within this overall framework, our compensation committee reviews each component of executive compensation separately and also takes into consideration the value of each NEO's compensation package as a whole and its relative value in comparison to our other NEOs. 
Our compensation committee evaluates our compensation philosophy and executive compensation program as circumstances require, and reviews executive compensation annually. As part of this review, we expect that our compensation committee will apply our philosophy and the objectives outlined above, together with consideration for the levels of compensation that we would be willing to pay to ensure that our executive compensation remains competitive and that we meet our retention objectives, as well as the cost to us if we were required to find a replacement for a key executive officer. 
Compensation-Setting Process 
Role of our Compensation Committee 
Compensation decisions for our NEOs are made by our compensation committee. Currently, our compensation committee is responsible for reviewing, evaluating and approving the compensation arrangements, plans, policies, and practices for our NEOs and overseeing and administering our cash-based and equity-based compensation plans. 
Near the beginning of each fiscal year, our compensation committee, after consulting with our management team and its compensation consultant, considers analysis of compensation data from our compensation peer group as one of several factors that inform its judgment of appropriate parameters for target compensation levels. Our compensation committee generally seeks to provide target total direct compensation that is competitive and, dependent on Company performance and other factors including those set forth below, may pay above, at, or below median levels of our compensation peer group. Our compensation committee does not apply a formula or assign relative weights to specific compensation elements. Our compensation committee believes that over-reliance on benchmarking can result in compensation that is unrelated to the value delivered by our executive officers because compensation benchmarking does not take into account the specific performance of our executive officers, our relative size, growth, and performance, or any of our unique circumstances or strategic considerations. 
In addition to the foregoing, our compensation committee makes compensation decisions after consideration of many factors, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance and experience of each executive officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The scope and strategic impact of the executive officer's responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
- 40 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our past business performance and future expectations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our long-term goals and strategies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance of our executive team as a whole;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For each executive officer, other than our Chief Executive Officer, the recommendation of our Chief Executive  Officer based on an evaluation of his or her performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The challenge and cost of replacing high-performing leaders with  in-demand skills;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The past compensation levels of each individual;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The relative compensation among our executive officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The competitiveness of our compensation relative to our compensation peer group.  
[END TABLE]
At the beginning of each fiscal year, after taking into consideration the factors noted above, our compensation committee makes decisions with respect to any base salary adjustment, and establishes the corporate performance objectives and target annual cash incentive compensation opportunities and equity awards for our executive officers, including our NEOs, for the upcoming fiscal year. With respect to our annual cash incentive compensation plan, our compensation committee determines the applicable target levels for each corporate performance objective used for each applicable quarterly performance measurement period. 
Our compensation committee reviews our executive compensation program from time to time, including any incentive compensation plans, to determine whether they are appropriate, properly coordinated, and achieve their intended purposes, and to make any modifications to existing plans and arrangements or to adopt new plans or arrangements. 
Role of Management 
In carrying out its responsibilities, our compensation committee works with members of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer (and, prior to his departure, our former Chief Executive Officer) and our Chief Human Resources Officer. Typically, our management team (together with our compensation committee's compensation consultant) assists our compensation committee in the execution of its responsibilities by providing information on corporate and individual performance, market data with respect to compensation, and management's perspective and recommendations on compensation matters. 
In fiscal 2018, except with respect to his own compensation, our former Chief Executive Officer made recommendations to our compensation committee regarding compensation matters, including the compensation of our executive officers. In addition, our former Chief Executive Officer participated in meetings of our compensation committee, except with respect to discussions involving his own compensation, in which case he is not present for that portion of the meeting. 
While our compensation committee solicits the recommendations and proposals of our Chief Executive Officer with respect to compensation-related matters, these recommendations and proposals are only one factor in our compensation committee's decision-making process. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
Our compensation committee has the authority to retain the services of external advisors, including compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors, from time to time, as it sees fit, in connection with carrying out its duties. 
In fiscal 2018, our compensation committee continued to engage Compensia, Inc. ("Compensia"), a national compensation consulting firm, to assist us in executing our executive compensation strategy and guiding 
- 41 - 
 principles, assessing the current target total direct compensation opportunities of our executive officers, including comparing them against competitive market practices, developing a compensation peer group and advising on potential executive compensation decisions for fiscal 2018. In addition, Compensia provided a market analysis to our compensation committee in connection with the recruitment and hiring of Mr. Arora as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. 
Compensia does not provide any services to us other than the services provided to our compensation committee. Our compensation committee has assessed the independence of Compensia taking into account, among other things, the factors set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1 and the listing standards of the NYSE, and has concluded that no conflict of interest exists with respect to the work that Compensia performs for our compensation committee. 
Use of Competitive Data 
To assess the competitiveness of our executive compensation program and to assist in setting compensation levels, we refer to industry surveys, including the Radford High-Technology Executive Compensation Survey. In addition, during fiscal 2018, Compensia conducted an analysis of market data on the compensation peer group as approved by our compensation committee. 
Competitive Positioning 
In fiscal 2018, our compensation committee continued to compare and analyze our executive compensation with that of a formal compensation peer group of companies. 
In the context of our annual executive compensation review, with assistance from Compensia and input from management, our compensation committee approved a peer group of publicly-traded technology companies, which met some or all of the following criteria: (i) operated in a high-technology industry, focusing on software, hardware and networking companies; (ii) annual revenue approximately between approximately $925 million and $3.7 billion; (iii) revenue growth greater than 20%; (iv) a market capitalization between approximately $3.4 billion and $40.8 billion; and (v) a market capitalization as a multiple of annual revenue that was greater than three. As a result of the application of these criteria, we removed the following companies from our 2017 compensation peer group: LinkedIn, Inc., which was acquired, NetSuite, Inc., which was acquired and each of CheckPoint Software, Inc. and VeriSign, Inc., because they no longer met our growth and/or market capitalization requirements and were not sufficiently relevant comparable companies. In addition, we added MicroChip Technology Incorporated, Square, Inc., SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. and Veeva Systems Inc. which satisfied the above described criteria. The remainder of the peer group is unchanged. 
The following publicly-traded companies made up our compensation peer group for the compensatory decisions made during fiscal 2018:

 our compensation committee considers other factors in setting actual compensation. Such factors include our growth and scale; our recent performance against financial targets; the overall competitive market for our executives; the value of each executive's position; the skills, tenure, and experience of our executives; the alignment between the market based positions and the actual responsibilities of our executives; each executive's performance; our executives' expected future contributions; the incentives provided to our executives to stay with us and drive our continued growth; prior to our former Chief Executive Officer's resignation, his recommendations (except with respect to his own compensation), internal parity considerations; the value of each executive's unvested equity holdings; the dilutive effect of our long-term incentive compensation program; the overall impact that these equity awards would have on stockholder value; the results of each annual stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our executives; and stockholder feedback on our executive compensation program. 
Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program Components 
The following describes each component of our executive compensation program, the rationale for each, and how the compensation amounts and awards were determined for fiscal 2018. 
Base Salary 
Base salary is the primary fixed component of our executive compensation program. We use base salary to compensate our NEOs for services rendered during the fiscal year and to ensure that we remain competitive in attracting and retaining executive talent. Generally, we establish the initial base salaries of our executive officers through arm's-length negotiation at the time we hire the individual executive officer, taking into account his or her position, qualifications, experience, prior salary level, and the base salaries of our other executive officers. 
Thereafter, our compensation committee reviews the base salaries of each NEO annually and makes adjustments as it determines to be reasonable and necessary to reflect the scope of a NEO's performance, contributions, responsibilities, experience, current salary level, position (in the case of a promotion), and market positioning, as appropriate. 
In October 2017, in connection with its review of our executive compensation program, our compensation committee approved adjustments to the base salaries of Messrs. McLaughlin, Bonvanie, Anderson, and Klarich to be effective November 1, 2017, to reflect the competitive market, each individual's responsibilities and to recognize each individual's performance. The approved base salary increases for each NEO, are as set forth below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    Base Salary at End of Fiscal 2017 ($)      Base Salary Effective November 1, 2017 ($)      Percentage Increase   
 Mr. McLaughlin      750,000        900,000        20%  
 Mr. Tomlinson      475,000        475,000        0%  
 Mr. Bonvanie      365,000        400,000        9.6%  
 Mr. Anderson      740,000        775,000        4.7%  
[END TABLE]
The relatively larger increase for Mr. McLaughlin reflected an existing base salary that was on the lower end with respect to our compensation peer group, the significance of his responsibilities expected in fiscal 2018 and beyond and his strong performance that warranted a more competitive base salary relative to our compensation peer group. 
Mr. Klarich's base salary for fiscal 2018 was $550,000. 
The total base salaries of our NEOs paid for fiscal 2018, are set forth in the "Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table" below. 
- 43 - 
Short-Term Cash Incentive Compensation 
We use short-term cash incentive compensation to motivate our NEOs to achieve our annual financial and operational objectives, while making progress towards our longer-term strategic and growth goals. Typically, near the beginning of each fiscal year, our compensation committee adopts an incentive compensation plan for that fiscal year, which identifies the plan participants and establishes the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity for each participant, the performance measures to be used to determine whether to make payouts for the fiscal year and the associated target levels for each measure, and the potential payouts based on actual performance for the fiscal year. Typically, annual cash incentive compensation payouts have been determined after the end of the applicable performance period based on our performance against one or more financial and/or operational performance objectives for the performance period as set forth in our annual operating plan. 
Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan. In August 2017, our compensation committee adopted and approved a sub-plan under our omnibus Employee Incentive Compensation Plan for fiscal 2018 (the "Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan"). The Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan provided for potential performance-based incentive payouts to all employees not paid commissions, including our NEOs. Further, the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan provided opportunities for annual cash incentive compensation payouts based on our actual achievement of pre-established corporate financial objectives as set forth in our annual operating plan. The target levels for the financial objectives in our annual operating plan were set at levels determined to be challenging and requiring substantial skill and effort on the part of senior management. The Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan included quarterly performance periods with semi-annual payouts, including a potential accelerator and discretionary "over-performance" pool payable at the end of the year. 
Target Annual Incentive Compensation Opportunities. As in prior years, the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunities for our NEOs were expressed as a percentage of their respective base salaries. In October 2017, in connection with its review of our fiscal 2018 executive compensation program, our compensation committee decided to maintain the percentage for all NEOs' target annual cash incentive compensation opportunities, with the exception of Mr. McLaughlin whose percentage decreased 10% and Mr. Bonvanie whose percentage increased 10%, at their fiscal 2017 levels. However, due to the base salary increases described above, the dollar amount of the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunities increased for each of our NEOs, including Mr. McLaughlin. These base salary adjustments were generally intended so that the total target cash compensation opportunity for each NEO would be in line with the competitive market data (as reflected by our compensation peer group). For clarity, the adjustments approved in October 2017 were effective as of the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and the target annual incentive compensation opportunities for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were the same as those at the end of fiscal 2017. The target annual incentive compensation opportunities established under the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan for our NEOs were:

Mr. Klarich's target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity was 60% of his annual base salary. 
Corporate Performance Measures. For purposes of funding the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan, our compensation committee selected revenue and earnings per share as the corporate performance measures. Our compensation committee chose revenue as a performance measure because we are currently focused on growing our business and revenue is a key metric during this stage of our growth and enhances long-term value creation for our stockholders. Our compensation committee chose earnings per share as a performance measure because it is an important profitability measure tied to management performance and how much profit we are generating for our stockholders. 
In order to receive a payout under the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan both corporate performance measures needed to meet minimum pre-established achievement levels for the relevant performance period. For purposes of the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan, (x) "revenue" was defined as GAAP revenue as reflected in our quarterly and annual financial statements, consistent with our annual operating plan; and (y) "earnings per share" was defined as non-GAAP net income per share as reflected in our quarterly earnings press releases furnished to the SEC, adjusted to exclude the effects of incentives paid out under our Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan. 
Performance Requirements. Under the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan, funding would be made with respect to any particular quarter only if both 97% of the applicable fiscal quarter's revenue target and 91% of the applicable fiscal quarter's earnings per share target are achieved, each as set forth in the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan. Achievement of 100% of both performance targets (on an annual aggregated basis) would have paid out at 100% of the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity, and achievement of 102% of the revenue target and 106% of the earnings per share target would have paid out at 110% of the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity (with any such payment in excess of 100% of the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity referred to as an accelerator). 
Achievement above the minimum achievement required for each fiscal quarter would result in a pro-ratednon-linear payout based on the payout percentages specified in the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan. With respect to achievement in excess of 110%, such performance could be rewarded at the end of the fiscal year using a discretionary "over-performance" pool that would be funded at 200% of each NEO's applicable target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity, less any accelerator. 
Our compensation committee could use its discretion to adjust down the actual cash incentive compensation payout. To inform its decision whether to exercise discretion under the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan, our compensation committee could consider metrics in our annual operating plan other than revenue or earnings per share to balance the focus of our short-term incentive compensation program or any other factors or considerations that it deemed relevant, such as one-time accounting adjustments, any item deemed outside of normal operations, and any other extraordinary circumstances. 
The total payouts under the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan (which includes any accelerator and/or discretionary payments) were capped at 300% of the target amounts. 
For fiscal 2018, our revenue increased by $511.5 million to $2.3 billion compared to fiscal 2017 and our non-GAAP earnings per share increased by $1.28 per share compared to fiscal 2017. In light of our strong revenue and earnings per share performance in 2018, we achieved, on an aggregated basis, approximately 103% of our revenue targets and approximately 107% of our earnings per share targets. We exceeded our revenue and earnings per share targets, which would have paid at approximately 117.5% (assuming full payout of accelerator 
- 45 - 
 and discretionary payments), on an annual aggregated basis, our compensation committee examined other factors and considerations beyond the level of achievement of the performance targets that it deemed to be relevant to determining our overall performance in fiscal 2018, and our compensation committee accordingly decided to pay our NEOs (other than Mr. Arora) between approximately 116% to 117% of target on an aggregated annual basis under our Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan. 
The annual cash incentive award payouts made to our NEOs for fiscal 2018 under the Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan are set forth in the "Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Equity Compensation 
Following our initial public offering, through fiscal 2016, we granted time-based equity awards to our NEOs. In fiscal 2017, we made significant changes to our compensation program with the introduction of performance-based equity awards, along with time-based equity awards. For fiscal 2018, the long-term incentive compensation opportunities of our executive officers consisted of 50% time-based restricted stock unit awards ("RSUs") and 50% performance-based stock unit awards ("PSUs"). 
For fiscal 2018, our compensation committee decided to continue granting both time-based and performance-based equity awards. In October 2017, in consultation with Compensia, we granted equity awards consisting of 50% RSUs and 50% PSUs to Messrs. McLaughlin, Bonvanie, Anderson, and Klarich after reviewing the equity compensation for our NEOs to assess whether each NEO was properly incentivized and rewarded. 
For the PSUs, the target number of shares set forth in the table below represents the target number of shares eligible to be earned and subsequently vest upon achievement of the target performance on the billings metric for fiscal 2018. For purposes of the PSU target billings metric, "billings" was defined as total revenue plus the change in total deferred revenue, net of acquired deferred revenue, during fiscal 2018, and further adjusted to exclude post acquisition related billings. The PSUs reflect our compensation committee's continued commitment to incorporating performance measures into our long-term equity incentive program. The actual number of shares subject to the PSUs earned and eligible to vest was determined after the one-year performance period, based on achievement of the pre-established billings target in fiscal 2018. Our compensation committee believed that setting a one-year performance measurement period for the PSUs was appropriate in fiscal 2018 because our growth and historical financial outperformance continues to make the establishment of appropriate multi-year billings metrics difficult. 
The number of PSU shares that would be eligible for time-based vesting was to be determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if we achieved 90% of the billings target, then 50% of the shares subject to the PSUs would be eligible for  vesting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if we achieved 100% of the billings target, then 100% of the shares subject to the PSUs would be eligible for  vesting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if we achieved 110% or more of the billings target, then 120% of the shares subject to the PSUs would be eligible  for vesting.  
[END TABLE]
If we achieved less than 90% of the billings target, then all of the shares subject to the PSUs would be forfeited. If performance was between the applicable tiers described above, then the payout of the PSUs eligible for vesting scaled linearly. 
Once the number of PSUs that satisfied the billings performance measure described above was determined, those earned PSU shares were eligible to vest on the same vesting schedule as the fiscal 2018 RSUs awarded to such executive officer. However, the quarterly vesting component for the PSUs was not satisfied until the 
- 46 - 
 performance achievement was determined by our compensation committee after the end of fiscal 2018, in essence creating a one-year "cliff" vesting requirement for the PSUs. Our compensation committee believes that the addition of a time-based vesting schedule for any earned PSU shares is important to provide additional long-term incentives for our highly valuable executive officers. Under this approach, while the threshold performance-period was one year, the imposition of a three-year additional time-vesting period was a way to balance the difficulty of setting multi-year performance goals while providing a longer-term incentive with back-end loaded vesting schedules. 
In fiscal 2018, we achieved $2.9 billion in billings. In accordance with the payout attainment scale under the fiscal 2018 PSUs, our compensation committee determined that 102.8% of the billings metric payout was achieved, resulting in 105.51% of each NEO's target PSU becoming earned PSU shares that are eligible for vesting based on the time-based vesting schedule. 
The RSU awards approved by our compensation committee are set forth in the table below. Our compensation committee determined that the RSUs should vest over four years. Specifically: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  With respect to equity awards granted to Messrs. McLaughlin and Ms. Bonanno, one-sixteenth of the shares subject to such award would vest on January 20, 2018, and the remaining shares would vest in equal increments quarterly thereafter in the second, third and fourth years, subject to  their individual continued employment with us.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  With respect to Mr. Bonvanie's equity award, 20% of the shares subject to such award would vest in  equal increments each quarter in the first year, 40% of the shares subject to such award would vest in equal increments each quarter in the second year, and 20% of the shares subject to such award would vest in equal increments each quarter in the  third and fourth years, subject to his continued employment with us.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  With respect to Mr. Anderson's equity award, 18.75% of the shares subject to such award would vest in  equal increments each quarter in the first year, 31.25% of the shares would vest in equal increments each quarter in the second and third years, and 18.75% of the shares would vest in equal quarterly amounts in the fourth year, subject to his  continued employment with us.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  With respect to Mr. Klarich's equity award, 25% of the shares subject to such award would vest in  equal increments each quarter in the first year, 37.5% of the shares subject to the award would vest in equal increments each quarter in the second year; 25% of the shares subject to the award would vest in equal increments each quarter in the third  year and 12.5% of the shares subject to such award would vest in equal increments each quarter in the fourth year, subject to his continued employment with us.  
[END TABLE]
On August 29, 2017, Mr. Tomlinson, our former Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, notified us of his intention to retire and resign from his position. As a result of this notification, our compensation committee determined to not grant any equity awards to Mr. Tomlinson in fiscal 2018. 
In determining the aggregate value of each NEO's fiscal 2018 equity award, our compensation committee considered the growth and scale of our business; recent performance against financial targets; the overall competitive market for our NEOs; the value of the NEO's position; the individual achievement of the NEO; in the cases of Ms. Bonanno and Mr. Klarich, their appointment as our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Chief Product Officer, respectively; the NEO's expected future contributions; the skills, tenure, and experience of the NEO; the alignment between the market based position and the actual responsibilities of the NEO; the incentives provided by such equity awards to the NEO to stay with us and drive our continued growth; prior to our former Chief Executive Officer's resignation, his recommendations (except with respect to his own equity award); the competitive market data prepared by its compensation consultant; the value of the NEO's vested and unvested equity holdings; internal pay parity considerations; the dilutive effect of our long-term incentive compensation program; and the overall impact that these equity awards would have on stockholder value. 
- 47 - 
Our compensation committee determined that the sizes of these awards were appropriate due to (x) the significance of our NEOs' expected responsibilities in fiscal 2018 and beyond, (y) their strong performance that warranted a higher compensation relative to our compensation peer group, and (z) the need to provide them with an appropriate opportunity for reward based on the creation of long-term stockholder value. The chart below sets forth the number of RSUs, the target number of PSUs granted in October 2017 by our compensation committee and the number of shares of our common stock subject to the PSUs that were earned as determined by our compensation committee, as follows:

The equity awards granted to our NEOs during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, are set forth in the "Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Fiscal 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below. 
Welfare and Other Employee Benefits. We have established a tax-qualified Section 401(k) retirement plan for all employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including requirements relating to age and length of service. We currently match contributions made to the plan by our employees up to $1,000, including our NEOs. In fiscal 2018, Ms. Bonanno and Messrs. Tomlinson, Anderson and Klarich participated in our Section 401(k) retirement plan. We intend for the plan to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or the Code, so that contributions by employees to the plan, and income earned on plan contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the plan. 
In addition, we provide other benefits to our NEOs on the same basis as all of our full-time employees in the country in which they are resident. These benefits include medical, dental, and vision benefits, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, short-term and long-term disability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and basic life insurance coverage. We design our employee benefits programs to be affordable and competitive in relation to the market, as well as compliant with applicable laws and practices. We adjust our employee benefits programs as needed based upon regular monitoring of applicable laws and practices and the competitive market. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits. In fiscal 2018, we provided limited perquisites to Mr. Anderson. We provided him with spousal travel and expenses to an annual vacation award for top sales performers. 
In the future, we may provide perquisites or other personal benefits in limited circumstances, such as where we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual NEO in the performance of his or her duties, to make our NEOs more efficient and effective, and for recruitment, motivation, or retention purposes. All future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will be approved and subject to periodic review by our compensation committee. 
Employment Agreements 
Each of our NEOs is a party to an employment arrangement setting forth the material terms of his or her employment. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these arrangements, see the section titled " —Executive Employment Agreements." 
- 48 - 
Post-Employment Compensation 
The employment arrangement for each of our NEOs includes payments and/or benefits related to an involuntary termination of employment, including in connection with a change in control of our company on a double trigger basis. We believe that these protections assist us in retaining these individuals. We also believe that these protections serve our executive retention objectives by helping our NEOs maintain continued focus and dedication to their responsibilities to maximize stockholder value, including in the event that there is a potential transaction that could involve a change in control of our company. The terms of these post-employment compensation arrangements were determined after our board of directors and compensation committee reviewed our retention goals for each NEO and an analysis of relevant market data. 
For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these post-employment compensation arrangements, see the sections titled "—Executive Employment Agreements" and "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Other Compensation Policies 
Stock Ownership Policy 
Our board of directors believes that our executive officers and the non-employee members of our board of directors should hold a meaningful financial stake in our company to closely align their interests with those of our stockholders and therefore adopted stock ownership guidelines in fiscal 2017. Under these guidelines, our Chief Executive Officer and executive officers who report directly to our Chief Executive Officer are required to achieve ownership of our common stock within five years of the later of August 26, 2016 or such executive officer's hire, appointment or election date as applicable, at the following levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Chief Executive Officer must own the lesser of (i) common stock with a value of five times his or her  annual base salary or (ii) 22,000 shares; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each executive officer must own the lesser of (i) common stock with a value of his or her annual base salary  or (ii) 3,825 shares.  
[END TABLE]
The base salary multiples above are consistent with current market practices, and the alternative share number thresholds are intended to provide our executive officers with certainty as to whether the guidelines are met, regardless of our then-current stock price. 
Compensation Recovery Policy 
During fiscal 2018, we adopted a Clawback Policy pursuant to which we may seek the recovery of performance-based incentive compensation paid by us. The Clawback Policy applies to our Chief Executive Officer and to all officers who report directly to the Chief Executive Officer, including our NEOs. The Clawback Policy provides that if (i) we restate our financial statements as a result of a material error; (ii) the amount of cash incentive compensation or performance-based equity compensation that was paid or is payable based on achievement of specific financial results paid to a participant would have been less if the financial statements had been correct; (iii) no more than two years have elapsed since the original filing date of the financial statements upon which the incentive compensation was determined; and (iv) our compensation committee unanimously concludes, in its sole discretion, that fraud or intentional misconduct by such participant caused the material error and it would be in our best interests to seek from such participant recovery of the excess compensation, then our compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, seek repayment from such participant. 
Hedging and Pledging Policies 
Our insider trading policy prohibits our executive officers and members of our board of directors from engaging in derivative securities transactions, including hedging, with respect to our common stock and from pledging company securities as collateral or holding company securities in a margin account. 
- 49 - 
Risk Assessment and Compensation Practices 
Our management assesses and discusses with our compensation committee our compensation policies and practices for our employees as they relate to our risk management, and based upon this assessment, we believe that any risks arising from such policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. In reaching this conclusion, we have considered, among other things, the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our incentive compensation plan reflects a pay for performance philosophy that rewards our NEOs and other  eligible employees for achievement of performance targets, and historically, we reserve the payment of discretionary bonuses for extraordinary performance and achievement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our equity awards include multi-year vesting schedules requiring long-term employee commitment;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we regularly monitor short-term and long-term compensation practices to determine whether management's  objectives are satisfied; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for our Fiscal 2018 Incentive Compensation Plan, we instituted a per person cap of 300% of the target incentive  compensation opportunity for each quarter to manage costs and to limit any potential risks related to short-term incentives.  
[END TABLE]
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation. Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows public companies a tax deduction for federal income tax purposes of remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer and certain other highly compensated executive officers in any taxable year. For tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, remuneration in excess of $1 million may only be deducted if it is "performance-based compensation" within the meaning of the Code. 
The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that the compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017, that have not been subsequently materially modified. 
While our compensation committee is mindful of the benefit of being able to fully deduct the compensation paid to our NEOs, our compensation committee believes that we should retain the flexibility to provide compensation to our NEOs that is not fully tax deductible when it believes that such payments are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent or meet other business objectives. Our compensation committee intends to continue to compensate our NEOs in a manner consistent with the best interest of our company and our stockholders. 
Taxation of "Parachute" Payments. Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code provide that executive officers and directors who hold significant equity interests and certain other service providers may be subject to significant additional taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control that exceeds certain prescribed limits and that we (or a successor) may forfeit a deduction on the amounts subject to this additional tax. We did not provide any of our NEOs with a "gross-up" or other reimbursement payment for any tax liability that the NEO might owe as a result of the application of Sections 280G or 4999 during fiscal 2018, and we have not agreed and are not otherwise obligated to provide any NEO with such a "gross-up" or other reimbursement. 
Accounting for Share-Based Compensation. We follow ASC Topic 718 for our share-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all share-based compensation awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, based on the grant date "fair value" of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation 
- 50 - 
 tables below, even though our NEOs may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their share-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award. 
Report of the Compensation Committee 
Our compensation committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on such review and discussion, our compensation committee has recommended to our board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement. 
Respectfully submitted by the members of the compensation committee of our board of directors:

CEO Pay Ratio 
Under SEC rules, we are required to provide information regarding the relationship between the annual total compensation of our CEO and the annual total compensation of our median employee. Because we had two different CEOs during the fiscal year, the SEC rules permit us to choose one of those CEOs for this pay ratio disclosure. We chose to present the CEO pay-ratio for Mr. McLaughlin and that of our median employee as (1) Mr. McLaughlin served as our CEO through June 6, 2018, (2) Mr. Arora served as our CEO for less than a quarter and (3) Mr. Arora received significant new hire awards as part of our efforts to recruit him as our new CEO which are not representative of our typical CEO pay practices. For our last completed fiscal year, which ended July 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees (other than Mr. McLaughlin) of ours (including  our consolidated subsidiaries was approximately $223,885. This annual total compensation is calculated in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, and reflects, among other things, salary, all  bonuses earned, commissions, other cash payments, PTO payouts, allowance, employer benefit and 401(k) contribution matches, ESPP purchase gain, and the aggregate "grant date fair value" of RSU awards granted during the 12- month period ended July 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. McLaughlin's annual total compensation, as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table included  in this Proxy Statement, was $14,356,271.  
[END TABLE]
- 52 - 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on the above, for fiscal 2018, the ratio of Mr. McLaughlin's annual total compensation to the  median of the annual total compensation of all employees was approximately 64 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and based upon our reasonable judgment and assumptions. The SEC rules do not specify a single methodology for identification of the median employee or calculation of the pay ratio, and other companies may use assumptions and methodologies that are different from those used by us in calculating their pay ratio. Accordingly, the pay ratio disclosed by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio as disclosed above. 
The methodology we used to calculate the pay ratio is described below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined the median of the annual total compensation of our employees as of May 1, 2018 at which time  we (including our consolidated subsidiaries) had approximately 5,139 full-time and part-time employees, including interns, approximately 3,275 of who are U.S. employees, and approximately 1,864 (or approximately 36% of our total employee population)  of who are located outside of the United States. As permitted under the SEC rules, we then determined the median employee as of such date by excluding individuals from certain jurisdictions totaling approximately 1% of our workforce, leaving 5,092  employees in our median analysis. The countries (and populations) excluded were as follows: Argentina (2), Chile (2), Colombia (2), Costa Rica (1), Egypt (2), Hungary (1), Indonesia (15), Pakistan (2), Peru (2), the Philippines (10), South Africa  (2), Tunisia (2), and Vietnam (4).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We then compared the sum of (i) the annual base salary of each of these employees for fiscal 2018, plus  (ii) the total annual cash incentive bonus, commission or other cash compensation, as applicable, earned by each of these employees for fiscal 2018 as reflected in our payroll records, plus (iii) the aggregate employer benefit, 401(k)  contribution benefits and ESPP purchase gains, plus (iv) the aggregate grant date fair value of equity awards (as determined in accordance with footnote 1 to the Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table) granted to these employees in fiscal 2018,  to determine the median employee. Compensation paid in foreign currency was converted to U.S. dollars using a spot exchange rate on May 1, 2018. In determining the median total compensation of all employees, we did not make any cost of living  adjustments to the compensation paid to any employee outside the U.S.  
[END TABLE]
Once we identified our median employee, we estimated the median employee's annual total compensation in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, yielding the median annual total compensation disclosed above. With respect to Mr. McLaughlin's annual total compensation, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table.

We did not sponsor any defined benefit pension or other actuarial plan for our Named Executive Officers during our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
We did not maintain any nonqualified defined contribution or other deferred compensation plans or arrangements for our Named Executive Officers during our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018. 
Executive Employment Agreements 
We have entered into employment offer letters with each of our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Zuk) in connection with his or her commencement of employment with us. 
In connection with Mr. McLaughlin's resignation as our Chief Executive Officer, we entered into a new offer letter with Mr. McLaughlin on May 31, 2018. Additionally, in December 2011, we entered into confirmatory new employment agreements with Messrs. Zuk and Bonvanie to achieve consistency in the employment terms and conditions of our then-serving executive officers. 
Each of our Named Executive Officers is eligible to receive certain severance payments and/or benefits in connection with his or her termination of employment under various circumstances, including following a change in control, pursuant to written severance and change in control arrangements. 
For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these arrangements, as well as an estimate of the potential payments and/or benefits payable to our Named Executive Officers under these arrangements, see the description below and the section titled "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. The estimated potential severance payments and/or benefits payable to each Named Executive Officer in the event of termination of employment as of July 31, 2018, pursuant to the arrangements under the employment agreements, are described below. 
The actual amounts that would be paid or distributed to our Named Executive Officers as a result of one of the termination events occurring in the future may be different than those presented below as many factors will affect the amount of any payments and/or benefits upon a termination of employment. For example, some of the 
- 58 - 
 factors that could affect the amounts payable include the Named Executive Officer's base salary and the market price of our common stock. Although we have entered into written arrangements to provide severance payments and/or benefits to our Named Executive Officers in connection with a termination of employment under particular circumstances, we or an acquirer may mutually agree with the Named Executive Officers on severance terms that vary from those provided in these pre-existing arrangements. Finally, in addition to the amounts presented below, each Named Executive Officer would also be able to exercise any previously-vested stock options that he or she held. For more information about the Named Executive Officers outstanding equity awards as of July 31, 2018, see the section titled "—Fiscal 2018 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End." 
Along with the severance payments and/or benefits described in a Named Executive Officer's individual severance and change in control arrangement, they are eligible to receive any benefits accrued under our broad-based benefit plans, such as accrued vacation pay, in accordance with those plans and policies. 
Termination of Employment Unrelated to a Change in Control

However, we did not deem such shares outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our audit committee is to consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to our audit committee, including, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. Our audit committee has determined that certain transactions will not require audit committee approval, including certain employment arrangements of executive officers, director compensation, transactions with another company at which a related party's only relationship is as a non-executive employee, director or beneficial owner of less than 10% of that company's shares and the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $500,000 or 2% of our company's total annual revenues, transactions where a related party's interest arises solely from the ownership of our common stock and all holders of our common stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis, and transactions available to all employees generally.

OTHER MATTERS 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock, file reports of ownership and changes of ownership with the SEC. Such directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
SEC regulations require us to identify in this proxy statement anyone who filed a required report late during the most recent fiscal year. Based on our review of forms we received, or written representations from reporting persons stating that they were not required to file these forms, we believe that during our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were satisfied on a timely basis. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Annual Report and SEC Filings 
Our financial statements for our fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which we will make available to stockholders at the same time as this proxy statement. This proxy statement and our annual report are posted on our website at www.paloaltonetworks.com and are available from the SEC at its website at www.sec.gov. You may also obtain a copy of our annual report without charge by sending a written request to Investor Relations, Palo Alto Networks, Inc., 3000 Tannery Way, Santa Clara, California 95054.
