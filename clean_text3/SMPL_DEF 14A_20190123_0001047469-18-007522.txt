      Information About Attending the Annual Meeting

      Information About this Proxy Statement         
        Why You Received this Proxy Statement.    You have received these proxy materials because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement includes information that we are required to provide to you under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and that is designed to assist you in voting your shares. 
         Availability of Proxy Statement and Annual Report.    Pursuant to SEC rules, we have elected to provide access to this proxy statement and our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended August 25, 2018 (the "Annual Report") via the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and at any postponement or adjournment thereof. The Notice is being mailed to stockholders beginning on or about December 7, 2018. Stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials at www.proxyvote.com or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials by mail or an electronic set of materials by email. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet  Table of Contents or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. 
      Information About Voting         
        Stockholders can vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy. There are three ways to vote by proxy:
        Telephone and Internet voting facilities for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on January 22, 2019. We encourage you to submit your proxy as soon as possible (by telephone, Internet or by mail) even if you plan to attend the meeting in person. 
        If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, you will receive instructions from the holder of record as to how to vote your shares. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. Telephone and Internet voting may also be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. If your shares are not registered in your own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a legal proxy or broker's proxy card and bring it to the Annual Meeting in order to vote. 
        Please note that if you hold your shares through a broker, your broker cannot vote your shares on the election of directors unless you have given your broker specific instructions as to how to vote. In order for your vote to be counted, please make sure that you submit your vote to your broker. 
        If you vote by proxy, the individuals named on the proxy card (your "proxies") will vote your shares in the manner you indicate. You may specify whether your shares should be voted for or against all, any or none of the nominees for director and whether your shares should be voted for or against each of the other proposals. If you sign and return the proxy card without indicating your instructions, your shares will be voted as follows:
        You may revoke or change your proxy before the meeting for any reason by (1) if you are a registered stockholder (or if you hold your shares in "street name" and have a proper legal proxy from your broker), voting in person at the Annual Meeting, (2) submitting a later-dated proxy, either by telephone or online (your last vote before the meeting begins will be counted), or (3) sending a written revocation that is received before the Annual Meeting to the Corporate Secretary of The Simply Good Foods Company, c/o The Simply Good Foods Company, 1225 17th Street, Suite 1000, Denver, Colorado 80202. 
        Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote. As of the Record Date, there were 81,877,918 shares of our common stock outstanding.  Table of Contents
      Quorum Requirement         
        A quorum is necessary to hold a valid meeting. The holders of a majority in voting power of the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a bank or broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Banks and brokers will have discretionary voting power for the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for our 2019 fiscal year (Proposal 2), but not for voting on the election of the Class II director nominees (Proposal 1). 
      Required Votes for Action to be Taken         
        Three Class II directors have been nominated for election to our Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") provide that directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present and entitled to vote and actually cast on the election of such directors. This means that the three Class II director nominees receiving the highest number of "FOR" votes cast will be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election. 
        For the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, the approval requires the affirmative vote of the holders of shares of common stock having a majority of the voting power of all of the shares of common stock present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such matter. Abstentions will have the effect of voting against this proposal. The following table summarizes the votes required for passage of each proposal and the effect of abstentions and uninstructed shares held by brokers. 
        Brokers and custodians cannot vote uninstructed shares on your behalf in director elections. For your vote to be counted, you must submit your voting instruction form to your broker or custodian.
      Other Business to be Considered         
        Our Board of Directors does not intend to present any business at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals described in this Proxy Statement and knows of no other matters that are likely to be brought before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matter properly comes before the Annual Meeting, your proxies will act on such matter in their discretion. 
      Information About the Company         
        We were formed on March 30, 2017 to consummate a business combination between Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. ("Conyers Park") and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. ("Atkins") which occurred on July 7, 2017 (the "Business Combination"). As a result of the Business Combination, Simply Good Foods owns all of the equity in Atkins.  Table of Contents 
    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE         
      Board of Directors         
        In accordance with our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. At each annual meeting of stockholders, the successors to directors whose terms then expire will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following election. Except as otherwise provided by law and subject to the terms of the investors rights agreement (the "Investor Rights Agreement") entered into between Simply Good Foods and Conyers Park Sponsor, LLC ("Conyers Park Sponsor"), and any other rights of any class or series of preferred stock, vacancies on our Board of Directors (including a vacancy created by an increase in the size of the Board of Directors) may be filled only by the remaining directors. See "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions—Investor Rights Agreements" below for additional information on certain director nomination rights. 
        Our directors are divided among the three classes as follows:
      Director Independence         
        NASDAQ listing standards require that a majority of our Board of Directors be independent. An "independent director" is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of our Board of Directors, would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our Board of Directors conducts an annual assessment of the independence of each member of our Board of Directors, taking into consideration all relationships between us and/or our officers, on the one hand, and each director on the other, including the director's commercial, economic, charitable and family relationships, and such other criteria as our Board of Directors may determine from time to time. 
        Our Board of Directors has determined that Ms. Ghez and Messrs. Kilts, West, Ratzan, Daley, Healey, Montgomery, Kash and Laube are "independent directors" as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules. In making its independence determinations, the Board of Directors considered whether any of the directors was or is a party to certain types of relationships and transactions. See "—Review of Related Person Transactions" below. Joseph E. Scalzo was determined to not be an independent director because he currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company. 
      Board Leadership Structure         
        Our Board of Directors does not have a policy regarding separation of the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors believes it is in our best interests to make that determination based on circumstances from time to time. Currently, our Chairman of the Board is not an officer of the Company. The Chairman of the Board of Directors chairs the meetings of our Board of Directors and meetings of our stockholders, with input from the Vice Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. The Vice Chairman works with the Chief Executive Officer to develop and gain approval from the Board of Directors of the growth strategy of Simply  Table of Contents
Good Foods and works with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in coordinating our activities with key external stakeholders and parties. These activities include corporate governance matters, investor relations, financing and mergers and acquisitions. Our Board of Directors believes that this structure, combined with our corporate governance policies and processes, creates an appropriate balance between strong and consistent leadership and independent oversight of our business. 
        Our Board of Directors believes that our current leadership structure and the composition of our Board of Directors protect stockholder interests and provide adequate independent oversight, while also providing outstanding leadership and direction for our Board of Directors and management. More than a majority of our current directors are "independent" under NASDAQ standards, as more fully described above. 
        The independent directors of the full Board of Directors, and each Board committee (of which all are comprised of independent directors), meet in executive sessions, without management present, during each regularly scheduled Board or committee meeting and are very active in the oversight of the Company. Each independent director has the ability to add items to the agenda for Board meetings or raise subjects for discussion that are not on the agenda for that meeting. In addition, our Board of Directors and each Board committee has complete and open access to any member of management and the authority to retain independent legal, financial and other advisors as they deem appropriate. 
      Annual Evaluations of the Board and Board Committees         
        Each year through the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors and each Board committee conducts a self-evaluation to assess their respective performances and consider potential areas of improvement. The assessments focus on the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and each Board committee, assessed against their respective responsibilities as set forth in the Board's Governance Guidelines and each committee charter. Directors consider matters such as fulfillment of the board's and their individual primary responsibilities, effectiveness of discussion and debate at meetings, the quality and timeliness of Board of Directors and Board committee materials and presentations, the composition of the Board of Directors and each Board committee (including experience, skills and independence of members), and effectiveness of the Board of Directors' and each Board committee's processes. Responses are reviewed and shared with the Board of Directors and respective Board committees, and appropriate responsive actions considered as necessary. 
      Review of Related Person Transactions         
        Our Audit Committee must review and approve any related person transaction in which we propose to enter. The Audit Committee's charter and our Related Party Transactions Policy detail the policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present actual, potential or perceived conflicts of interest and may raise questions as to whether such transactions are consistent with the best interest of Simply Good Foods and our stockholders. 
        A summary of such policies and procedures is set forth below. Any potential related party transaction that is brought to the Audit Committee's attention will be analyzed by the Audit Committee, in consultation with outside counsel or members of management, as appropriate, to determine whether the transaction or relationship does, in fact, constitute a related party transaction. At its meetings or in the interim as necessary, the Audit Committee will be provided with the details of each new, existing or proposed related party transaction, including the terms of the transaction, the business purpose of the transaction and the benefits to us and to the relevant related party.  Table of Contents
        In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Audit Committee must consider, among other factors, the following factors to the extent relevant:
        Any member of the Audit Committee who has an interest in the transaction under discussion must abstain from any voting regarding the transaction, but may, if so requested by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, participate in some or all of the Audit Committee's discussions of the transaction. Upon completion of its review of the transaction, the Audit Committee may determine to permit or to prohibit the transaction. 
      Role of the Board of Directors in Risk Oversight         
        Members of the Board of Directors have an active role, as a whole and also at the Board committee level, in overseeing management of the Company's risk. While the Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for overall risk oversight at our Company, our three Board committees assist the full Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. The Audit Committee has primary responsibility for reviewing and discussing the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which the Company's exposure to risk is handled, and for monitoring the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps the Company has taken to monitor and control such exposures. In connection with its risk assessment and management responsibilities, the Audit Committee oversees risks related to cybersecurity and other risks relevant to our computerized information system controls and security. The Audit Committee also is charged with overseeing risks with respect to our Related Party Transaction Policy as noted above, and with any potential conflicts of interest with directors and director nominees. The Compensation Committee is charged with ensuring that our compensation policies and procedures do not encourage risk taking in a manner that would have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is charged with overseeing the process of conducting management succession planning and management development. Each Committee reports its findings to the full Board of Directors for consideration. 
      Communications with the Board of Directors         
        If our stockholders or other interested parties wish to contact any member of our Board of Directors, they may write to the Board of Directors or to an individual director in care of the Corporate Secretary at The Simply Good Foods Company, 1225 17th Street, Suite 1000, Denver, Colorado 80202; or through our third-party ethics and compliance reporting website at SimplyGoodFoods.Ethicspoint.com. Relevant communications will be distributed to the Board of Directors, or to any individual director or directors as appropriate, depending on the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication. Communications that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board of Directors will not be forwarded, such as business solicitations or advertisements, junk mail, mass mailings and spam, new product suggestions, product complaints or inquiries, resumes and other forms of job inquiries, or surveys. In addition, material that is threatening, illegal or similarly unsuitable will be excluded. Any communication that is screened as described above will be made available to any director upon his or her request.  Table of Contents
      Process for Recommending or Nominating Potential Director Candidates         
        Subject to certain investor rights under the Investor Rights Agreement, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with the input of the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for recommending nominees for Board membership to fill vacancies or newly created positions, and for recommending the persons to be nominated for election at the Annual Meeting. In connection with the selection and nomination process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the desired experience, skills, diversity and other qualities to ensure appropriate Board composition, taking into account the current Board members and the specific needs of the Company and the Board of Directors. In connection with the process of nominating incumbent directors for re-election to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the director's tenure on and unique contributions to the Board of Directors. 
        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may retain, as appropriate, search firms to assist in identifying qualified director candidates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will generally look for individuals who have displayed high ethical standards, integrity, sound business judgment and a willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties. 
        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee continually reviews Board composition and potential additions while striving to maintain and grow a diverse and broad skill set that complements the business. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted nominating criteria guidelines that include understanding operations, marketing, finance or other aspects relevant to the success of a publicly traded company in today's business environment, with broad experience in relevant disciplines. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider certain factors related specifically to our business, including, but not limited to:
        The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not assigned specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. In the evaluation of potential new candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers each candidate's qualifications in light of the then-current mix of Board attributes, including diversity. Continuing directors are evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in the same way, including the continuing director's past contributions to the Board of Directors in such evaluation. 
        Although the Board of Directors does not have a formal policy specifying how diversity of background and personal experience should be applied in identifying or evaluating director candidates, to help ensure that the Board of Directors remains aware of and responsive to the needs and interests of our customers, stockholders, employees and other stakeholders, the Board of Directors believes it is important to identify qualified director candidates that would increase the gender, racial, ethnic and/or cultural diversity of the Board of Directors. Accordingly, the Nominating and Corporate Governance  Table of Contents
Committee makes an effort when nominating new directors to ensure that the composition of the Board of Directors reflects a broad diversity of experience, profession, expertise, skill, and background, including gender, racial, ethnic, and/or cultural diversity. Nominees are not discriminated against on the basis of race, religion, national origin, disability or sexual orientation. The Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are committed to actively seeking female and minority candidates to join the Board of Directors. 
        Stockholders may recommend individuals to the Board of Directors for nomination and also have the right under our Bylaws to nominate directors. Stockholders may recommend individuals to the Board of Directors for consideration as potential director candidates by submitting candidates' names, appropriate biographical information (including age, business address and residence address, principal occupation or employment and relevant experience), the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company which are directly or indirectly owned beneficially or of record by the candidate, the date such shares were acquired and the investment intent of such acquisition, and any other information relating to the candidate that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other similar filing to the principal executive offices of the Company at: 
Corporate Secretary  c/o The Simply Good Foods Company  1225 17th Street, Suite 1000  Denver, Colorado 80202 
        Assuming the appropriate information has been provided, the Board of Directors will evaluate stockholder-recommended candidates by following substantially the same process, and applying substantially the same criteria, as it follows for candidates submitted by others. If the Board of Directors determines to nominate a stockholder-recommended candidate and recommends his or her election to the Board of Directors, then his or her name will be included in the proxy statement for the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
        In order for stockholders to nominate director candidates under our Bylaws, our Bylaws require that the Company be given advance written notice of stockholder nominations for election to the Board of Directors. Such nomination must contain the information required by our Bylaws with respect to the nominee and the stockholder. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to Simply Good Foods' Corporate Secretary, in the case of an annual meeting, not earlier than the 120th day and no later than the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the date of the preceding year's annual meeting. 
      Succession Planning and Management Development         
        The Board of Directors supports the development of the Company's executive talent, especially the Chief Executive Officer and the senior leaders of the Company, because continuity of strong leadership at all levels of the Company is part of the Board's mandate for delivering strong performance to stockholders. To further this goal, the executive talent development and succession planning process is overseen by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee pursuant to its charter. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is charged with developing and recommending to the Board of Directors the approval of an executive officer succession plan. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also is responsible for implementing the succession plan by developing and evaluating potential candidates for executive positions, and periodically reviewing the succession plan. 
        The Compensation Committee also indirectly supports the succession planning process through its annual approval of compensation targets and achievement of goals for incentive compensation payments.  Table of Contents

    DIRECTOR COMPENSATION         
   Director Compensation  
        The objectives of our director compensation program are to offer compensation that is competitive with the compensation paid by peer companies so that we may attract and retain qualified candidates for Board service and to reinforce our practice of encouraging stock ownership by our directors. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the compensation paid to non-employee directors and recommends changes to the Board of Directors, as appropriate. 
        Mercer (US) Inc. ("Mercer"), the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, conducted a review of our non-employee director compensation program. The review assessed the competitiveness of our non-employee director compensation relative to a composite of peer companies. After reviewing the assessment and consultation with Mercer, the Board of Directors approved a director compensation program in line with competitive non-employee director compensation levels within our industry. For fiscal year 2018, our director compensation program consisted of the following:

    MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS         
        Our Board of Directors has established certain standing committees to assist in the performance of its various functions. All Board committee members are appointed by our Board of Directors upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
        Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined, upon recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, that all of the members of our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees are independent as defined under the NASDAQ listing standards. The Board of Directors also has determined that all members of the Audit Committee meet the independence requirements contemplated by the NASDAQ listing standards and Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and, in determining the independence of all members of our Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors took into account the additional independence considerations required by the NASDAQ listing rules and Rule 10C-1 of the Exchange Act relating to Compensation Committee service. 
        Our Board of Directors typically meets on a quarterly basis and holds special meetings as necessary. In fiscal year 2018, our Board of Directors met six times. Directors are required to regularly attend Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which they serve, unless unforeseen circumstances prevent them from doing so. In 2018, all directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees on which they served. While we do not have a formal policy requiring our directors to attend stockholder meetings, our directors are invited and encouraged to attend all meetings of stockholders. All of our directors at the time attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
        The chart below lists the standing committees of our Board of Directors and indicates who currently serves on those committees. 
        The responsibilities of each of our standing Board committees are described below. Each of the Board committees operates under a written charter; has authority to retain independent legal, accounting or other advisors, at our expense; makes regular reports to the Board of Directors; and reviews its own performance annually. 
        Audit Committee.    The Audit Committee is responsible for, among other matters: (1) performing the Board's oversight responsibilities as they relate to the Company's accounting policies and internal controls, financial reporting practices, legal and regulatory compliance and the audit of the Company's financial statements; (2) maintaining a line of communication between the Board of Directors and the Company's financial management; and (3) preparing the report to be included in the Company's annual  Table of Contents proxy statement. Our Audit Committee consists of Messrs. Healey, Daley and Laube, with Mr. Healey serving as the chair of the committee. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee qualifies as an independent director according to the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect to audit committee membership, and that Mr. Healey qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as such term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee met four times in fiscal year 2018. 
        Compensation Committee.    The Compensation Committee is responsible for, among other matters: (1) reviewing key employee compensation goals, policies, plans and programs; (2) reviewing and approving the compensation of our directors, chief executive officer and other executive officers; (3) reviewing and approving employment agreements and other similar arrangements between us and our executive officers; and (4) administering our stock plans and other incentive compensation plans. Our Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Daley, Ratzan, Montgomery, and West, with Mr. Daley serving as the chair of the committee. The Compensation Committee has delegated a sub-committee of Messrs. Daley and Montgomery (the "Compensation Sub-Committee") the authority to grant equity awards to executive officers. The Compensation Committee met five times in fiscal year 2018. 
         Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.    Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for, among other matters: (1) identifying individuals qualified to become members of our Board of Directors, consistent with criteria approved by our Board of Directors; (2) overseeing the organization of our Board of Directors to discharge the Board's duties and responsibilities properly and efficiently; (3) identifying best practices and recommending corporate governance principles; and (4) developing and recommending to our Board of Directors a set of corporate governance guidelines and principles applicable to us. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Messrs. Kilts and Kash and Ms. Ghez, with Ms. Ghez serving as chair of the committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met five times in fiscal year 2018. 
        The processes and procedures followed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in identifying and evaluating director candidates are described above under the heading "Corporate Governance—Process for Recommending or Nominating Potential Director Candidates." 
      Review of Risk in our Compensation Programs         
        We have reviewed our compensation policies and practices for our employees and concluded that any risks arising from our policies and programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. We reviewed our conclusion with our Compensation Committee, which believes that the mix and design of the elements of our compensation program are appropriate and encourage executive officers and key employees to strive to achieve goals that benefit the Company over the long term. 
      Independent Compensation Consultant         
        The Compensation Committee has retained Mercer as its independent executive compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee with respect to our compensation programs for non-employee directors, executive officers, and senior executives. Mercer has not provided, and is not expected to provide, advice or assistance to Simply Good Foods in any areas other than executive compensation. In addition, the Compensation Committee considered the independence of Mercer in light of SEC rules and NASDAQ listing standards requiring compensation committees to assess the independence of their compensation consultant, legal counsel and other advisors prior to receiving advice from them. The Compensation Committee has reviewed its and the Company's relationships with Mercer and has not identified any conflicts of interest.  Table of Contents

      Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control         
        The employment arrangements with each of our named executive officers provide for the payment of severance benefits upon certain terminations of employment. 
   Severance Benefits Under the Employment Arrangements  
        We have agreed to pay severance benefits in the event we terminate an executive's employment without "cause" or an executive resigns for "good reason" (in each case, as defined in the applicable agreement). We also provide severance benefits in the case of an executive's termination of employment due to death or disability. 
   Mr. Scalzo

        On April 10, 2017, Conyers Park entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") to effect the Business Combination.

The shares of Class A common stock of Conyers Park issued and outstanding at the closing were canceled and converted automatically into the right to receive one share of our common stock, subject to certain exceptions.

Such exercised vested options were cancelled and terminated at the closing and the holders of such options were entitled to the Exercised Option Shares Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement). All options that were either unvested or unexercised were cancelled at the closing.
