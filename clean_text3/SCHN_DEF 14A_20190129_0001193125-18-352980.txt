The following flowchart provides an overview of the Compensation Committee's process in setting performance goals. 
Shareholder Outreach 
In 2018, we continued a process that began four years ago when we instituted our formal shareholder engagement plan. This plan is designed to engage our shareholders in an open and transparent manner and to solicit our shareholders' input on corporate governance, board composition, executive compensation, corporate social responsibility, and any other matters which may be raised by our shareholders. Our engagement plan provides for primary engagement prior to the establishment of our compensation plans for the upcoming year and after we are able to evaluate the voting results from our annual meeting, and developments in corporate governance, compensation, and corporate social responsibility best practices. 
Our engagement team includes the Chairman of the Board, Lead Director, and the Chair of the Compensation Committee as appropriate. As part of our engagement, we expect to reach out annually to our largest shareholders holding at least a majority of our total outstanding shares. We also engage with proxy advisory firms that advise our primary shareholders. During 2018, we pro-actively reached out to investors holding approximately two-thirds of our outstanding shares. The results of our shareholder engagement activities are shared with our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Compensation Committee, and the full Board of Directors.

Fiscal 2018 Business Performance & Accomplishments 
In fiscal 2018, we delivered our strongest financial performance in the past seven years with both divisions producing strong results. We almost tripled our consolidated operating income on a year-over-year basis. We also generated 19% higher total ferrous volumes, 9% higher total nonferrous volumes, and 5% higher finished steel volumes year-over-year. Our strong results reflect the benefits from strategic initiatives to grow volumes and expand margins, supported by positive market conditions and a continued focus on productivity. 
As shown in the graphs below, we delivered significant improvements in our business performance in fiscal 2018. Our fiscal 2018 reported earnings per share of $5.46, which includes discrete tax benefits of $1.58 per share, represents a substantial increase compared to fiscal 2017 reported earnings per share of $1.60. Our return on capital employed also grew significantly in fiscal 2018. Even excluding discrete tax benefits, we achieved a return on capital employed of over 15%, demonstrating the successful execution of our growth and capital investment strategy. 
In our Auto and Metals Recycling business, we exported our ferrous and nonferrous products to 25 countries, demonstrating the flexibility of our operating platform. In our Cascade Steel and Scrap business, operating income increased more than six times year-over-year, and we continued our multi-year strategy to enhance product quality, increase productivity, and invest capital to enhance our operations. Our strong operating income performance in fiscal 2018 enabled us to deliver operating cash flow of $160 million and reduce our debt by 26% while continuing to invest in our Company and return capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend payments of $21 million and share repurchases of $17 million or almost 2% of total outstanding shares.

Providing Sustainable Value Through Recycling 
As one of North America's largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal and a manufacturer of finished steel products made from recycled scrap metal, Sustainability is at the center of our business model. At Schnitzer, we are diverting and recycling materials that might otherwise be destined for a landfill, conserving natural resources, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Steel, our largest traded material, is the world's most recycled product. As compared to using newly mined ore, using recycled metal in steel manufacturing:

Sustainability Report 
We recently issued our fifth annual Sustainability Report, which details our environmental, social and governance achievements in fiscal 2017 and 2018. We have enhanced our Sustainability Report to cross-reference against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Index. 
Because we highly value the perspective of our stakeholders, we conducted a Sustainability Materiality Assessment in fiscal 2018 to identify key Sustainability-related topics relevant to our people, communities, shareholders, customers, and the environment. Aligned with the findings of this Sustainability Materiality Assessment, our Sustainability Report shares progress across five areas:

[BEGIN TABLE]
    Highlights from the FY2017-FY2018 Sustainability Report include:    Integrity, Ethics, and Compliance: We maintain a robust and effective  independent corporate compliance program led by our Chief Compliance  Officer who reports jointly to our CEO and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our focus is on promoting our Code of Conduct,  communicating and educating  our employees on the importance of making ethical decisions, and fostering an environment where employees feel  free to report concerns. We train 100% of our non-union employees annually on our Code of  Conduct. In fiscal 2017, we began including unionized  employees in this training and will have incorporated all employees by the end of fiscal 2019.    Safety, Health, and Wellness: The safety, health, and wellness  of our employees are top priorities at Schnitzer, and our safety culture is an  essential component of sustained success. While 76% of our facilities experienced zero lost time due to injuries in fiscal 2018, we are determined  to  continually improve our safety performance across all divisions and all facilities. Our Wellness Committee promotes healthy lifestyles and  sponsored a number of events throughout the year such as offering free home smoke detector installation  in conjunction with the American Red  Cross Sound the Alarm campaign to ensure that all employees have working fire alarms.    Diversity, Inclusion and Cultural Awareness: With over 3,500 employees, we take pride in our diverse and inclusive workforce. We actively   encourage a culture where everyone is treated with respect, fairness, and equal opportunity to reach their full potential within the organization. In  2017, to build on our progress in this area, we launched a formal Diversity and Inclusion  Program and in 2018, appointed a Chief Diversity Officer  reporting directly to our CEO. Also in 2018, we launched our cultural awareness campaign focused on increasing cultural awareness, inspiring  employee engagement, and fostering an  environment where open and safe conversations can exist.    Community Engagement and Partnerships: At Schnitzer, we are dedicated to positively impacting the over 100 communities in which we live  and  work, and we have a long legacy of volunteerism, partnership, and charitable giving. Our employees lead our local community engagement  efforts through direct involvement in community initiatives and memberships in community organizations, as  well as participation in philanthropic  and charity events. Examples of community engagement and partnerships include:    In April 2018, over 1,300 employees from 80 facilities participated in  Earth Day activities from cleanups of local parks and beaches to scrap  drives with local schools.      Since 2008, we have been a partner in the Fishing for  Energy partnership that has collected over 3.8 million pounds of derelict fishing gear for  recycling and energy conversion.      Since 2009, we have supported the Boston Police  Department and 15 other local police departments by recycling the metal from more than  8,000 weapons taken off the streets.      In fiscal 2018, our Pick-N-Pull stores raised more than $250,000 in donations for local food banks.      Our company and our employees contributed over $120,000  in fiscal 2018 to Schnitzers charitable foundation, Recycling For A Better  Tomorrow, to provide disaster relief funding to aid employees and their families impacted by natural disasters.   Environmental Performance and Protection: We actively promote  and support sustainable practices throughout our operations and continue to  show year-over-year improvement in our sustainability key performance indicators which have been externally verified and assured for accuracy.  On a normalized (per-unit) basis in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018, we lowered our carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, and  process waste generated. We also diverted more waste from landfills by recycling  higher volumes of scrap metal and recovering other materials. In  fiscal 2018, our Sustainability performance included the following:

Our employees lead our local community engagement  efforts through direct involvement in community initiatives and memberships in community organizations, as  well as participation in philanthropic  and charity events. Examples of community engagement and partnerships include:    In April 2018, over 1,300 employees from 80 facilities participated in  Earth Day activities from cleanups of local parks and beaches to scrap  drives with local schools.      Since 2008, we have been a partner in the Fishing for  Energy partnership that has collected over 3.8 million pounds of derelict fishing gear for  recycling and energy conversion.      Since 2009, we have supported the Boston Police  Department and 15 other local police departments by recycling the metal from more than  8,000 weapons taken off the streets.      In fiscal 2018, our Pick-N-Pull stores raised more than $250,000 in donations for local food banks.      Our company and our employees contributed over $120,000  in fiscal 2018 to Schnitzers charitable foundation, Recycling For A Better  Tomorrow, to provide disaster relief funding to aid employees and their families impacted by natural disasters.   Environmental Performance and Protection: We actively promote  and support sustainable practices throughout our operations and continue to  show year-over-year improvement in our sustainability key performance indicators which have been externally verified and assured for accuracy.  On a normalized (per-unit) basis in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018, we lowered our carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, and  process waste generated. We also diverted more waste from landfills by recycling  higher volumes of scrap metal and recovering other materials. In  fiscal 2018, our Sustainability performance included the following:      
    Highlights from the FY2017-FY2018 Sustainability Report include:    Integrity, Ethics, and Compliance: We maintain a robust and effective  independent corporate compliance program led by our Chief Compliance  Officer who reports jointly to our CEO and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our focus is on promoting our Code of Conduct,  communicating and educating  our employees on the importance of making ethical decisions, and fostering an environment where employees feel  free to report concerns. We train 100% of our non-union employees annually on our Code of  Conduct. In fiscal 2017, we began including unionized  employees in this training and will have incorporated all employees by the end of fiscal 2019.    Safety, Health, and Wellness: The safety, health, and wellness  of our employees are top priorities at Schnitzer, and our safety culture is an  essential component of sustained success. While 76% of our facilities experienced zero lost time due to injuries in fiscal 2018, we are determined  to  continually improve our safety performance across all divisions and all facilities. Our Wellness Committee promotes healthy lifestyles and  sponsored a number of events throughout the year such as offering free home smoke detector installation  in conjunction with the American Red  Cross Sound the Alarm campaign to ensure that all employees have working fire alarms.    Diversity, Inclusion and Cultural Awareness: With over 3,500 employees, we take pride in our diverse and inclusive workforce. We actively   encourage a culture where everyone is treated with respect, fairness, and equal opportunity to reach their full potential within the organization. In  2017, to build on our progress in this area, we launched a formal Diversity and Inclusion  Program and in 2018, appointed a Chief Diversity Officer  reporting directly to our CEO.

Safety, Health, and Wellness: The safety, health, and wellness  of our employees are top priorities at Schnitzer, and our safety culture is an  essential component of sustained success. While 76% of our facilities experienced zero lost time due to injuries in fiscal 2018, we are determined  to  continually improve our safety performance across all divisions and all facilities. Our Wellness Committee promotes healthy lifestyles and  sponsored a number of events throughout the year such as offering free home smoke detector installation  in conjunction with the American Red  Cross Sound the Alarm campaign to ensure that all employees have working fire alarms.    Diversity, Inclusion and Cultural Awareness: With over 3,500 employees, we take pride in our diverse and inclusive workforce. We actively   encourage a culture where everyone is treated with respect, fairness, and equal opportunity to reach their full potential within the organization. In  2017, to build on our progress in this area, we launched a formal Diversity and Inclusion  Program and in 2018, appointed a Chief Diversity Officer  reporting directly to our CEO. Also in 2018, we launched our cultural awareness campaign focused on increasing cultural awareness, inspiring  employee engagement, and fostering an  environment where open and safe conversations can exist.    Community Engagement and Partnerships: At Schnitzer, we are dedicated to positively impacting the over 100 communities in which we live  and  work, and we have a long legacy of volunteerism, partnership, and charitable giving. Our employees lead our local community engagement  efforts through direct involvement in community initiatives and memberships in community organizations, as  well as participation in philanthropic  and charity events. Examples of community engagement and partnerships include:    In April 2018, over 1,300 employees from 80 facilities participated in  Earth Day activities from cleanups of local parks and beaches to scrap  drives with local schools.      Since 2008, we have been a partner in the Fishing for  Energy partnership that has collected over 3.8 million pounds of derelict fishing gear for  recycling and energy conversion.      Since 2009, we have supported the Boston Police  Department and 15 other local police departments by recycling the metal from more than  8,000 weapons taken off the streets.      In fiscal 2018, our Pick-N-Pull stores raised more than $250,000 in donations for local food banks.      Our company and our employees contributed over $120,000  in fiscal 2018 to Schnitzers charitable foundation, Recycling For A Better  Tomorrow, to provide disaster relief funding to aid employees and their families impacted by natural disasters.   Environmental Performance and Protection: We actively promote  and support sustainable practices throughout our operations and continue to  show year-over-year improvement in our sustainability key performance indicators which have been externally verified and assured for accuracy.  On a normalized (per-unit) basis in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018, we lowered our carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, and  process waste generated. We also diverted more waste from landfills by recycling  higher volumes of scrap metal and recovering other materials. In  fiscal 2018, our Sustainability performance included the following:      
    Highlights from the FY2017-FY2018 Sustainability Report include:    Integrity, Ethics, and Compliance: We maintain a robust and effective  independent corporate compliance program led by our Chief Compliance  Officer who reports jointly to our CEO and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Fiscal 2018 Compensation Summary 
Our fiscal 2018 compensation program links pay to performance. As a result of this linkage of pay to performance, actual compensation in fiscal 2018 was higher than target levels reflecting alignment with the Company's strong financial performance as represented by the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The overall Annual Performance Bonus Program ("APBP") performance multiple for the CEO was 2.60x and the  overall Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("AICP") performance multiple for the other NEOs was 1.66x.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For fiscal 2018, the annual incentive plans for the CEO and other NEOs included a bonus modifier based on corporate  performance measures and target goals that were designed to drive profitable growth and achieve strategic objectives. The targets for the bonus modifier were intended to be "stretch" goals that could not be easily achieved. As a result of our reaching these goals in fiscal 2018, a  modifier of 7.5% was applied to and is included in the CEO's APBP payout multiple and a modifier of 15% was applied to and is included in the other NEOs' AICP payout multiple, in each case as set forth above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance shares that vested for the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period paid out at an aggregate average of 1.48x  of target for the CEO and other NEOs.

To promote a performance-based culture that aligns the interests of management and shareholders, our executive compensation program focuses extensively on performance-based and equity-based compensation. As illustrated in the charts below, the substantial majority of our NEOs' target compensation in fiscal 2018 was in the form of "at-risk" compensation (short-term and long-term). Fixed Pay consists of annual base salary, and At-Risk Pay consists of performance-based cash incentives, time-based equity awards, and performance-based equity awards. 
STI - Short-Term Incentive (performance-based annual cash incentive) 
LTIP-RSU - Long-Term Incentive Plan Restricted Stock Units (time-based equity awards) 
LTIP-PS - Long-Term Incentive Plan Performance Share (performance-based equity awards) 
Proxy Statement 
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., an Oregon corporation (the "Company"), to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the time and place and for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting (the "Annual Meeting"). We are mailing a printed copy of this proxy statement and a proxy card to certain of our shareholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting on or about December 19, 2018. All other shareholders will receive a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice"), which is being mailed on or about December 19, 2018. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, not including a proxy card, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice. 
Questions and Answers About These Proxy Materials and Voting 
Why am I being provided with these materials? 
We are providing you with this proxy statement because the Board is soliciting your proxy to vote at the Annual Meeting to be held on January 29, 2019 or any adjournments thereof. You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting, and we request that you vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. You do not need to attend the meeting to vote your shares. If you have received a printed copy of these materials by mail, you may simply complete, sign, and return your proxy card or follow the instructions below to vote your shares by proxy over the telephone or through the Internet. If you did not receive a printed copy of these materials by mail and are accessing them on the Internet, you may simply follow the instructions below to vote your shares by proxy through the Internet. For shares held through a broker, bank, or nominee, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker or nominee, or by obtaining a proxy executed in your favor from the shareholder of record (broker, bank, or nominee). 
What if I received a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials? 
In accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the SEC, instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to each shareholder of record we may furnish proxy materials to our shareholders over the Internet. We believe this is a more cost-effective and environmentally-sensitive way to provide our shareholders with this information. If you received a Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials. 
 Instead, the Notice will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice will also instruct you as to how you may submit your proxy over the Internet. If you received a Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice. 
What am I voting on? 
The only matters scheduled for a vote are the election of the three nominated directors listed herein, the advisory vote on executive compensation described in this proxy statement, and the vote to ratify the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. 
How does the Board recommend that I vote my shares? 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR each of the nominees to the Board, FOR the advisory vote on executive compensation, and FOR the ratification of the selection of 
 PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

Who can vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Shareholders at the close of business on December 3, 2018 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters at the Annual Meeting. Each share of common stock (whether Class A or Class B) is entitled to one vote with respect to each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. You have one vote for each share of common stock held by you as of the Record Date, including shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Registered directly in your name with our transfer agent (also referred to as a "shareholder of record");   
• Held for you in an account with a broker, bank, or other nominee (shares held in "street name") – street  name holders generally cannot vote their shares directly and instead must instruct the broker, bank, or nominee how to vote their shares or, if they want to vote in person, they must obtain a proxy, executed in their favor, from the shareholder of  record (broker, bank, or other nominee).  
[END TABLE]
What if my shares are not registered directly in my name but are held in street name? 
If, at the close of business on December 3, 2018, your shares were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice or other proxy materials, as applicable, are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct that organization on how to vote the shares in your account. If your shares are held by a broker and you do not indicate how you wish to vote, your broker is permitted to exercise its discretion to vote your shares only on certain "routine" matters ("broker discretionary voting"). Proposal No. 3 with respect to the ratification of the selection of the 
 Company's independent registered public accounting firm is a "routine" matter, and your broker is permitted to exercise discretionary voting authority to vote your shares on this proposal if you do not provide your broker with voting instructions. Unless you provide your broker with voting instructions, your broker may not exercise discretionary voting authority and may not vote your shares with respect to the election of directors (Proposal No. 1) or the advisory vote related to executive compensation (Proposal No. 2). See the discussion of "broker non-votes" below. We strongly encourage you to submit your voting instructions and exercise your right to vote as a beneficial owner of shares. If you want to vote your shares in person, you will need to obtain a proxy executed in your favor from the shareholder of record. 
If I am a shareholder of record, how do I cast my vote? 
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote using any of the following methods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet – If you have Internet access, you may submit your proxy by going to  www.proxyvote.com and by following the instructions on how to complete an electronic proxy card. You will need the 16-digit number included on your Notice or your proxy card in order to vote by  Internet.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone – If you have access to a touch-tone telephone, you may submit your  proxy by dialing 1-800-690-6903 and by following the recorded instructions. You will need the  16-digit number included on your Notice or your proxy card in order to vote by telephone.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail – You may vote by mail by requesting a proxy card from us, indicating  your vote by completing, signing, and dating the card where indicated and by mailing or otherwise returning the card in the envelope that will be provided to you. You should sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example, as guardian, executor, trustee, custodian,  attorney, or officer of a corporation), indicate your name and title or capacity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In Person – You may cast your vote in person by attending the Annual Meeting. We  will give you a ballot when you arrive. Even if you plan to attend the meeting, we encourage you to vote by Internet, telephone, or mail so your vote will be counted if you later decide not to or cannot attend the meeting. If you attend the  Annual Meeting, you may then revoke your proxy and vote in person if you desire.

 associated with your Internet access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies. 
Internet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern time) on January 28, 2019 for the voting of shares. 
What if I return a proxy card but do not make specific choices? 
If you are a shareholder of record and return a signed and dated proxy card without marking any voting selections, your shares will be voted "FOR" the election of each of the nominees for director set forth in this proxy statement, "FOR" the advisory resolution on executive compensation, and "FOR" the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. If any other matter is properly presented at the meeting, your proxy (one of the individuals named on your proxy card) will vote your shares using his or her best judgment. 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and return signed and dated voting instructions without marking any voting selections, your shares may be voted at the discretion of your broker with respect to the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 (Proposal No. 3) but may not be voted with respect to the election of directors (Proposal No. 1) or the advisory vote related to executive compensation (Proposal No. 2). If any matter which is considered routine is properly presented at the meeting, your proxy (one of the individuals named on the proxy card) will vote your shares using his or her best judgment. Please return your voting instructions with your voting selections marked so that your vote can be counted. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters voted on at the Annual Meeting, and each share is entitled to one vote. A majority of the total outstanding shares of Class A and Class B common stock must be present or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Shares voted by proxy on any matter (including shares voted pursuant to a broker's discretionary voting authority) are counted as present at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. 
How many votes are required to approve each proposal? 
The election of directors (Proposal No. 1) will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election at the meeting, assuming a quorum is present. A plurality vote requirement means that the three director nominees with the greatest number of votes cast, even if less than a majority, will be elected. There is no cumulative voting. 
The advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 2) will be approved if the votes cast favoring the proposal exceed the votes cast opposing the proposal. 
While the vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 2) is advisory in nature and non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and intend to carefully consider the results when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
The ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 3) will be approved if the votes cast favoring the proposal exceed the votes cast opposing the proposal. 
How are votes counted? 
With respect to the election of directors, you may vote "FOR" or "WITHHOLD" with respect to each nominee. Votes that are withheld will be excluded entirely from the vote with respect to the nominee from which they are withheld. Votes that are withheld will not have any effect on the outcome of the election of directors. 
You may vote "FOR", "AGAINST", or "ABSTAIN" with respect to the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal No. 2) and the vote on the ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 3). For Proposal Nos. 2 and 3, abstentions will not have any effect on the outcome of the vote.

What is a "broker non-vote" and how does it affect voting on each item? 
A broker who holds shares for a beneficial owner has the discretion to vote on "routine" proposals when the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. A "broker non-vote" occurs when shares held by a broker are not voted with respect to a proposal because (1) the broker has not received voting instructions from the shareholder who beneficially owns the shares and (2) the broker lacks discretionary authority to vote the shares for that particular matter. Each of Proposal No. 1 (election of directors) and Proposal No. 2 (advisory vote on executive compensation) are considered to be non-routine matters, and brokers therefore lack discretionary authority to vote shares on such matters at this meeting. Broker non-votes, like other shares that are not voted at the meeting, have no effect on the outcome of the vote on such matters. 
Can I change my vote after submitting my proxy? 
Yes. You can revoke your proxy at any time before the final vote at the meeting. You may revoke your proxy in any one of the following five ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may submit another properly completed proxy card with a later date that is received prior to the taking of the vote  at the Annual Meeting.

• You may vote again on the Internet or by telephone before the closing of those voting facilities at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern  time) on January 28, 2019 (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted).

Voting Securities and Principal Shareholders 
The record date for determining shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting was December 3, 2018. At the close of business on December 3, 2018, a total of 27,026,152 shares of our common stock, par value $1.00 per share, were outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The outstanding common stock consisted of 26,826,152 shares of Class A common stock (Class A) and 200,000 shares of Class B common stock (Class B). Each share of common stock (whether Class A or Class B) is entitled to one vote with respect to each matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of November 30, 2018 (unless otherwise noted in the footnotes to the table) by (i) persons known to us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock, (ii) each of our current directors, (iii) each nominee for director, (iv) each of our executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table (each, a "named executive officer" and, collectively, the "named executive officers"), and (v) all of our current directors and executive officers as a group. Unless otherwise noted in the footnotes to the table, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all outstanding shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them. Except as noted below, the address of each shareholder in the table is c/o Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., 299 SW Clay Street, Suite 350, Portland, Oregon 97201. Each Class B share is convertible into one Class A share, and there are no meaningful distinctions between the rights of holders of Class A shares and Class B shares. Accordingly, the following table reports beneficial ownership of common stock in the aggregate and does not distinguish between Class A shares and Class B shares.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors, executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our outstanding common stock to file with the SEC reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of our common stock held by such persons. Executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% 
 shareholders are also required to furnish us copies of all forms they file under this regulation. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and representations that no other reports were required during fiscal 2018, we believe that all required Section 16(a) reports were timely filed for such fiscal year. 
Certain Transactions 
The Audit Committee charter requires the Audit Committee to review any reportable transaction or proposed transaction with a related person, or in which a related person has a direct or indirect interest, and determine whether to ratify or approve the transaction, with ratification or approval to occur only if the Audit Committee determines that the transaction is fair to the Company or that approval or ratification of the transaction is in the interest of the Company. 
One of our executive officers, Michael Henderson, has an immediate family member, Brian Henderson, who is employed by a subsidiary of the Company. The compensation of Brian Henderson was established by the Company in accordance with its employment and compensation practices applicable to employees with equivalent qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions. Michael Henderson does not have a material interest in the employment relationship nor does he share a household with the employee. Brian Henderson received fiscal 2018 compensation of $173,800. There were no other reportable related person transactions during fiscal 2018. 
Proposal No. 1 – Election of Directors 
We are asking shareholders to elect the three individuals nominated by the Board, each of whom is a current director. 
The Board currently consists of eight members divided into three classes pursuant to our 2006 Restated Articles of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws. One class of directors is elected each year for a three-year term. The term of Class I directors expires at the 2019 annual meeting; the term of Class II directors expires at the 2020 annual meeting; and the term of Class III directors expires at the 2021 annual meeting. Generally, the terms of directors continue until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 
Action will be taken at the 2019 Annual Meeting to elect three Class I directors to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of shareholders. The nominees for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting are Rhonda D. Hunter, David L. Jahnke and William D. Larsson as Class I directors. The Board has determined that Ms. Hunter and Messrs. Jahnke and Larsson qualify as independent directors under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, SEC rules, and NASDAQ requirements. If any nominee is unable to stand for election, the persons named in the proxy will vote the proxy for a substitute nominee in accordance with the recommendation of the Board. We are not aware of any nominee who is or will be unable to stand for election.

Corporate Governance 
The Company is committed to strong corporate governance. The Company is governed by a Board of Directors and Committees of the Board that meet throughout the year. Directors discharge their responsibilities at Board and Committee meetings and also through other communications with management. 
Our Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee, and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "N&CG Committee"), each of which has a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, copies of which are posted on our website at www.schnitzersteel.com. The Board of Directors has also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which are posted on our website. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, committee members are appointed annually and the chairs of, and director membership on, committees are periodically rotated based on the skills, desires, and experiences of the members of the Board. 
Director Independence 
The Board of Directors has determined that Wayland R. Hicks, Rhonda D. Hunter, David L. Jahnke, Judith A. Johansen, William D. Larsson, and Michael W. Sutherlin are "independent directors" as defined by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, SEC rules, and NASDAQ listing requirements. Accordingly, a majority of the directors have been determined to be independent directors. The independent directors regularly meet in executive sessions at which only independent directors are present. 
The independent directors serve on the following committees:

         Proposal No. 1 – Election of  Directors 
[END TABLE]
During fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors held four meetings, the Audit Committee held eight meetings, the Compensation Committee held six meetings, and the N&CG Committee held four meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and committees of the Board on which he or she served that were held during the period for which he or she served. We encourage all directors to attend each annual meeting of shareholders. All directors then serving attended the 2018 annual meeting. 
Board Leadership 
The current Board leadership structure separates the role of Chairman and CEO. These roles have been separate since May 2005, and the Board and the N&CG Committee have determined that the current structure continues to be appropriate as it enables the CEO to focus on the complexities and challenges of the role as our chief executive officer while enabling the Chairman to provide leadership at the Board level. This leadership structure also enables the Board to better fulfill its risk oversight responsibilities, as described under "The Board's Role in Risk Oversight." 
The Board periodically assesses its leadership structure in light of the Company's needs and circumstances. The Board also has a lead director, who is an independent director. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the lead director role is periodically rotated among the independent directors. The lead director's responsibilities include: facilitating effective communication between the Board and management; consulting with the Chairman and the CEO; and presiding at meetings of the Board when the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors. The lead director generally attends all meetings of the Board's committees.

For a description of the Compensation Committee's activities regarding executive compensation, refer to the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." 
Nominating and Corporate Governance ("N&CG") Committee 
Chair: William D. Larsson 
Additional Members: Wayland R. Hicks, Rhonda D. Hunter, and Judith A. Johansen 
Meetings Held in 2018: Four 
Independence: Our Board has determined that each member of the N&CG Committee is independent under applicable SEC regulations and NASDAQ rules. 
The N&CG Committee has responsibility for identifying, selecting, and recommending to the Board individuals proposed to be (i) nominated for election as directors by the shareholders or (ii) elected as directors by the Board to fill vacancies; working with the Chairman of the Board and the Lead Director, seeking to ensure that the Board's committee structure, committee assignments, and committee chair assignments are appropriate and effective; developing and recommending to the Board for approval, and reviewing from time to time, a set of corporate governance guidelines for the Company, which includes a process for the evaluation of the Board, its committees, and management; reviewing and evaluating risks related to corporate governance practices and leadership succession; developing and maintaining director education opportunities; and monitoring compliance with the corporate governance guidelines adopted by the Board. 
Assessment of Director Qualifications 
The N&CG Committee uses a Board composition matrix to inventory, on at least an annual basis, the expertise, skills, and experience of each director to ensure that the overall Board maintains a balance of knowledge and relevant experience. The Committee carefully reviews all director candidates, including current directors, based on the current and anticipated composition of the Board, our current and anticipated strategy and operating requirements, and the long-term interests of shareholders. In assessing current directors and potential candidates, the N&CG Committee considers the Board composition matrix, as well as the character, background, and professional experience of each current director and potential candidate. In its evaluation of potential candidates, the N&CG Committee applies the criteria set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and considers the following factors: 
In considering the re-nomination of incumbent directors, the N&CG Committee also takes into account the performance of such persons as directors, including the number of meetings attended and the level and quality of participation, as well as the value of continuity and knowledge of the Company gained through Board service.

Diversity 
The N&CG Committee strives to achieve diversity on the Board by considering skills, experience, education, length of service on the Board, and such other factors as it deems appropriate. The N&CG Committee and the Board define diversity broadly to include the background, professional experience, skills, and viewpoints necessary to achieve a balance and mix of perspectives. In evaluating potential director candidates, N&CG Committee and the Board place particular emphasis on diversity. Our Board recognizes the value of diversity and considers how a candidate may contribute to the Board in a way that can enhance perspective and judgment through diversity in gender, age, ethnic background, geographic origin, and professional experience.

Board Self-Assessments 
The Board conducts annual self-evaluations to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively and whether its governing documents continue to remain appropriate. Our Board's self-evaluation is facilitated by a wide range of questions related to topics including operations, composition of the Board, Board diversity, responsibilities, governing documents, and resources. As part of the Board self-evaluation process, each director also conducts an evaluation of the Chairman of the Board and the Lead Director. The process is designed and overseen by the N&CG Committee, and the results of the evaluations are discussed by the full Board. Each committee annually reviews its own performance and assesses the adequacy of its charter, and 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Proposal No. 1 – Election of  Directors 
         Proposal No. 1 – Election of  Directors 
[END TABLE]
 reports the results and any recommendations to the Board. The N&CG Committee oversees and reports annually to the Board its assessment of each committee's performance evaluation process. The N&CG Committee coordinates its oversight of the Board self-assessment process with its process for assessment of individual director qualifications. 
Director Nominations 
The N&CG Committee identifies potential director candidates through a variety of means, including recommendations from members of the Board, suggestions from Company management, and shareholder recommendations. The N&CG Committee also may, in its discretion, engage director search firms to identify candidates. Shareholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the N&CG Committee by submitting a written recommendation to Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc., Attn: Chair of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, c/o Corporate Secretary, 299 SW Clay Street, Suite 350, Portland, Oregon 97201. The recommendation should include the candidate's name, age, qualifications (including principal occupation and employment history), and written consent to be named as a nominee in our proxy statement and to serve as a director, if elected. All recommendations for nomination received by the Corporate Secretary that satisfy our bylaw requirements relating to such director nominations will be presented to the N&CG Committee for its consideration. 
The N&CG Committee meets to discuss and consider the qualifications of each potential new director candidate, whether recommended by shareholders or identified by other means, and determines by majority vote whether to recommend such candidate to the Board of Directors. The final decision to either elect a candidate to fill a vacancy between annual meetings or include a candidate on the slate of nominees proposed at an annual meeting is made by the Board of Directors. In considering the current directors, including the director nominees proposed for election at the 
 Annual Meeting, the N&CG Committee and the Board specifically considered the background, experiences, and qualifications described in their biographies appearing under "Proposal 1—Election of Directors" in this proxy statement. 
Director Tenure 
We do not have a fixed retirement age for directors. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, a director is required to submit a written resignation to the Board, to be effective at the end of the director's then current term, when the director begins his or her 15th year of service on the Board. The Board may accept or reject the tendered resignation after considering the recommendation of the N&CG Committee as to the appropriateness of the director's continued membership on the Board. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
We have a comprehensive enterprise risk management process in which management is responsible for managing the Company's risks and the Board and its committees provide oversight of these efforts. Our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief of Corporate Operations reports to our CEO, is responsible for the risk management program, and provides periodic reports to the Board. Risks are identified, assessed, and managed on an ongoing basis and communicated to management during management meetings or otherwise as appropriate. Existing and potential material risks are reviewed during periodic executive management and/or Board meetings, resulting in Board and/or Board committee discussion and public disclosure, as appropriate. 
The Board is responsible for overseeing management in the execution of its risk management responsibilities and for assessing the Company's approach to risk management. The Board administers this risk oversight function either through the full Board or through its standing committees.

Assessment of Compensation Risk 
Management and the Compensation Committee conducted an assessment of the risks associated with our compensation programs and determined that they do not create risks which are reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on us. In conducting the evaluation, the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of Pearl Meyer, its independent compensation consultant, reviewed our compensation structure and noted numerous ways in which risk is effectively managed or mitigated, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Balance of corporate and business unit weighting in incentive plans

• Mix between short-term and long-term incentives

[END TABLE]
In addition, the Compensation Committee analyzed the overall enterprise risks and how compensation programs could impact individual behavior that could exacerbate these enterprise risks. 
In light of these analyses, the Compensation Committee believes that the architecture of our compensation programs (executive and broad-based) provide multiple, effective safeguards to protect against undue risk. 
Board Oversight of Management Succession Planning 
Our Board and management consider succession planning and leadership development to be an integral part of the Company's long-term strategy. At least annually, our full Board reviews senior management succession and development plans with our CEO. Our CEO presents to the full Board her evaluations and recommendations of future candidates for key leadership roles, including for the CEO position, and potential succession timing for those positions, including under emergency circumstances. Following the CEO's presentation, the Board meets in executive session without our CEO to consider and discuss CEO succession. The Board also reviews and discusses development plans for individuals identified as high-potential candidates for key leadership positions, and the Board members interact with these candidates in formal and informal settings during the year. 
Prohibition on Hedging, Pledging and Derivative Trading 
Our stock trading policy, applicable to our directors and employees, prohibits hedging, pledging, and derivative trading in our Company's stock. Specifically, our stock trading policy prohibits engaging in any short sale of our stock, establishing or using a margin account with a broker-dealer for the purpose of buying or selling our stock or using it as collateral therefor, or buying or selling puts, calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, exchange funds, or other instruments or derivatives designed to hedge the value of our stock. 
Our Commitment to Sustainable Business Practices 
As one of our core values, sustainable business practices set the foundation for our longevity and continued success. We view sustainability as integrated into our business, a key component of our long-term strategy, and essential to our future growth and success. 
We are one of North America's largest recyclers of scrap metal, a leading provider of used and recycled auto parts, and a manufacturer of finished steel products from recycled metal. The very essence of our business model is predicated on recycling - a cornerstone for sustainability. Our automotive and metals recycling facilities process scrap metals for reuse by steel mills globally, and our steel mill produces finished products from recycled metals, conserving natural resources and significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
To increase the transparency of our sustainable business practices with our various stakeholders, we publish an annual Sustainability Report which focuses on: 
In November 2018, we released our fifth annual Sustainability Report which covered fiscal 2017 and 2018 and continued to show year-over-year reductions in our carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, and process waste generation on a normalized (per-unit) basis. We are committed to operating our business in a safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible manner. 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) we report on are aligned with internationally recognized standards and have been assured by independent analysis for materiality and accuracy. In order for us to further develop our sustainability strategy and identify levers and approaches to improve our sustainability performance, we appointed a Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer as a direct report to the CEO in fiscal 2017. 
In 2018, for the fourth year in a row, Schnitzer was named a World's Most Ethical Company by the Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. We also, again, earned the Ethics Inside© Certification and Anti-Bribery Program Verification, endorsements of our Company's commitment to ethical business practices. 
Additional information on our commitment to sustainable business practices is included in the Proxy Summary at page 3.

Non-Employee Director Compensation 
Our non-employee directors receive cash compensation as well as equity compensation in the form of DSUs for their Board service. Compensation for our non-employee directors is set by the Board at the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. 
Guiding Principles 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Fairly compensate directors for their responsibilities and time commitments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain highly qualified directors by offering a compensation program consistent with those at companies of  similar size, scope and complexity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align the interests of directors with our shareholders by providing a significant portion of compensation in equity and  setting an expectation pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines that directors acquire and continue to own our common stock with a value equal to five times the director's annual cash retainer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide compensation that is simple and transparent to shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
Review Process 
The Compensation Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, periodically assesses the form and amount of non-employee director compensation and recommends changes, if appropriate, to the Board based upon competitive market practices. The Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant also supports the Compensation Committee in determining director compensation and designing the related benefit programs. As part of its periodic review, the Compensation Committee conducts extensive benchmarking by reviewing director compensation data for the executive compensation peer group described in "Competitive Market Overview" on page 38. 
Annual Compensation

On January 30, 2018, the date of the Company's 2018 annual meeting, each director then in office  other than Mr. Carter and Ms. Lundgren was granted DSUs for 3,458 shares. The grant date fair value of this DSU grant to each director was $119,993 (or $34.70 per share) which was equal to the closing market price of the Company's  Class A common stock on the grant date. These DSUs vest on January 28, 2019 (the day before the 2019 Annual Meeting), subject to continued Board service. The DSUs become fully vested on the earlier death or disability of a director or a  change in control of the Company (as defined in the DSU award agreement). After the DSUs have become vested, directors will be credited with additional whole or fractional shares to reflect dividends that would have been paid on the stock underlying  the DSUs subsequent to the grant date. The Company will issue Class A common stock to a director for the vested DSUs in a lump sum in January of the year following the year the director ceases to be a director of the Company, subject to the  right of the director to elect an installment payment program under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

      At August 31, 2018, all non-employee directors, excluding Mr. Carter,  held 3,458 shares of unvested DSUs.

(3)  Represents a decrease of $21,067 in the actuarial present value of Mr. Carter's accumulated benefits under  the Company's Pension Retirement Plan and the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Bonus Plan. At August 31, 2018, the actuarial present value of Mr. Carter's accumulated benefits under these plans was $404,130.  During fiscal 2018, Mr. Carter received distributions of $26,141 under the Supplemental Executive Retirement Bonus Plan and distributions of $9,071 under the Pension Retirement Plan.

(4)  Mr. Anderson ceased to be a director on January 30, 2018, the date of the Company's 2018 annual meeting.   
[END TABLE]
The annual fee for non-employee directors is $80,000 ($105,000 for the Lead Director). We do not pay fees for attendance at Board and committee meetings. The annual cash retainer for the Chairs of the Audit and Compensation Committees is $18,000 and for the Chair of the N&CG Committee is $10,000. The Lead Director and Committee Chairs receive additional compensation due to the increased workload and additional responsibilities associated with these positions. 
In 2004, directors began participating in the Company's SIP, and in 2004 and 2005 non-employee directors received stock option grants. Since August 2006, non-employee directors have been awarded DSUs instead of stock options. One DSU gives the director the right to receive one share of Class A common stock at a future date (as described in footnote 2 above). At each annual meeting of shareholders, each non-employee director receives DSUs for a number of shares equal to $120,000 divided by the closing market price of the Class A common stock on the grant date. 
Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors are expected to make significant progress annually toward accumulating, within five years of becoming a director, common shares of the Company with a value equal to five times the director's annual cash retainer. 
Non-employee directors may elect to defer all or part of their compensation under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which was adopted by the Board in 2006. Directors' cash fees are credited to a cash account or a stock account, as selected by the director. Payments from the cash account are paid in cash, and payments from the stock account are paid in Class A common stock. The cash account is credited with quarterly interest equal to the average interest rate paid by us under our senior revolving credit agreement 
 (or if there are no borrowings in a quarter, at the prime rate) plus two percent. The stock account is credited with additional whole or partial shares reflecting dividends that would have been paid on the shares. Deferred amounts are paid in a single payment or in equal annual installment payments for up to 15 years commencing in January following the date the director ceases to be a director. DSUs are credited to the directors' stock accounts under the plan when the DSUs become vested, and the awards are administered under the plan. A director may elect to receive stock under a DSU in equal annual installment payments for up to 15 years commencing in January following the date the director ceases to be a director. 
Mr. Carter served as the Company's CEO from May 2005 until December 2008, when he was succeeded in that position by our current CEO, Ms. Lundgren. At that time, Mr. Carter entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with the Company to serve as our Chairman of the Board, which agreement has been further amended. Under the current agreement, Mr. Carter receives an annual fee of $300,000, payable quarterly in arrears, for service as non-employee Chairman, is ineligible for other compensation paid to non-employee directors, and receives continuation of health insurance benefits. The agreement with Mr. Carter currently continues the term of his service as Chairman through the date of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders in 2021. 
We have entered into indemnity agreements with each director pursuant to which we agree to indemnify such director in connection with any claims or proceedings involving the director by reason of serving as a director of the Company, as provided in the agreement. 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Overview 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides a detailed description of our executive compensation philosophy and programs, the decisions that the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") have made under those programs, and the factors considered in those decisions. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis focuses on the compensation of our NEOs for fiscal 2018 disclosed in the tables under the "Compensation of Executive Officers" section of this proxy statement. The NEOs for fiscal 2018 are listed below.

Consideration of 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote and Shareholder Outreach 
The Compensation Committee seeks to align the Company's executive compensation program with the interests of the Company's shareholders. On an annual basis the compensation of our NEOs, as disclosed in our annual proxy statement, is submitted to our shareholders for a non-binding advisory vote ("Say-on-Pay"). At our 2018 annual meeting, approximately 65% of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory resolution to approve our executive compensation program. This level of support was a significant decline from the 2017 and 2016 Say-on-Pay votes, when 96% of the votes cast were in favor of this proposal in each year. 
In order to gain a better understanding of any shareholder concerns and to identify areas for improvement within our executive compensation programs, we began a process four years ago to pro-actively reach out to our investors. Since 2015, we have had discussions, either by phone or in person, with shareholders representing more than half of our outstanding shares. These discussions have involved both the Chair of the Compensation Committee and either the Chairman of the Board of Directors or our Lead Independent Director. 
During 2018, we pro-actively reached out to investors holding approximately two-thirds of our outstanding shares, and had discussions with investors holding nearly 15% of outstanding shares. Prior to our 2018 annual meeting, the proxy advisory firm, Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS"), issued a negative vote recommendation in connection with our Say-on-Pay proposal. As a basis for its recommendation, ISS cited that while the Company had not materially extended nor amended the CEO's change-in-control agreement, the Company should have removed the legacy excise tax gross-up provision from the change-in-control agreement when the Company amended the CEO's employment agreement in connection with a $100,000 increase in base salary in July 2017. This 10% salary increase was the first increase in the CEO's base salary in over six years, reflecting the adverse market conditions during that period. Because the CEO's employment agreement provides for annual review and periodic increase of the CEO's base salary, the Company did not consider this to be a material amendment. While none of the investors we had discussions with in 2018 indicated that the excise tax gross-up issue resulted in a vote against our Say-on-Pay proposal, we are mindful of the ISS position and are committed to the Company's policy in place since 2008 that such excise tax gross-up provisions will not be included in any new or modified change-in-control agreements going forward.
Continuing a trend that began two years ago, this year there was a limited number of investors requesting a meeting which we attribute primarily to the Company's continued strong performance and satisfaction with the changes made in response to the shareholder input received in recent years, including the significant changes made to our executive compensation program beginning in fiscal 2016 and the improved readability and transparency of our proxy statement beginning with the proxy for fiscal 2015. 
Discussions with investors and shareholder Say-on-Pay voting are key drivers in our compensation design to continue alignment between our compensation programs and the interests of shareholders.

How Executive Pay is Linked to Company Performance 
Our executive compensation program is aligned with our business strategy and with creating long-term shareholder value by paying for performance consistent with what our Compensation Committee views as an acceptable risk profile. The foundation of our compensation philosophy is to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Promote creation of long-term shareholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recruit and retain qualified, high performing executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Motivate high levels of performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Be competitive in the market for talent.  
[END TABLE]
Our executive compensation program emphasizes delivering compensation at a competitive market level which will allow executive officers who demonstrate consistent on-target performance over a multi-year period to earn compensation that is competitive and consistent with targeted performance levels of total compensation. When performance is above target over the long term, we believe the program will reward executives above the competitive median. Conversely, the program will provide less than the annual target compensation when performance does not meet expectations. Individual executive compensation may be above or below the annual target level, based on the Company's performance; economic and market conditions; the individual's performance, contribution to the organization, experience, expertise, and skills; and other relevant factors.

Summary of our Executive Compensation Program 
Set forth below is a summary of our executive compensation practices. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We seek and carefully consider shareholder feedback regarding our compensation practices  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We link our executive compensation to our performance  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  More than 80% of the target compensation for the CEO and approximately 70% of the target compensation for the NEOs  other than the CEO are "at-risk."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  We select metrics in our short-term annual incentive plans that are expected to drive long-term shareholder value, and  metrics in our long-term incentive plan that are intended to reflect creation of shareholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  For the CEO, the fiscal 2018 Annual Performance Bonus Program ("APBP") metrics were linked to earnings per  share ("EPS"), safety performance, productivity improvements, operating cash flow, and strategic objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  For NEOs other than the CEO, the fiscal 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("AICP") metrics were linked  to EPS, safety performance, productivity improvements, and operating cash flow.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  For NEOs, including the CEO, the non-income statement metrics (i.e., safety  performance, productivity improvements, and operating cash flow) were capped in fiscal 2018 at 0.5x in the event adjusted earnings per share were negative.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  50% of the long-term equity awards are performance share awards that vest following the end of a three-year performance  period based on Company performance during the period. For performance share awards granted in fiscal 2018, the metrics are based 50% on relative TSR and 50% on ROCE.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  50% of the long-term equity awards are time-vested RSUs which vest ratably over a five-year time period, are intended  to incentivize executives to create shareholder value through stock price appreciation, and provide a retention incentive.  
[END TABLE]
 – For fiscal 2018, the annual incentive plans for the CEO and other NEOs included a bonus modifier based on corporate performance measures and target goals that were designed to drive profitable growth and achieve strategic objectives. The targets for the bonus modifier were intended to be "stretch" goals that could not be easily achieved. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Metrics and targets for incentive plans are based on the Company's strategic and business plans and annual budgets that are reviewed by the full Board and are analyzed and tested for reasonableness before Committee approval at the beginning of the performance period. The Committee actively  evaluates the appropriateness of the financial measures used in incentive plans and the degree of difficulty in achieving specific performance targets.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Peer group appropriateness  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Beginning with fiscal 2016, the process for selecting the Company's compensation peer group was changed to  identify a mix of companies which the Committee believes provides a more comparable aggregate benchmark. Quantitative and qualitative criteria were applied to better reflect current market capitalization and revenue parameters and to expand the  qualitative assessment of potential compensation peers to focus on position in the value chain and exposure to international markets.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Our benchmarking compensation peer group includes 13 companies that the Committee believes reflect appropriate  industry, size, geographic scope, and market dynamics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No reloading, re-pricing, or backdating of stock options  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership and retention requirements  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  We have adopted stock ownership guidelines to promote long-term alignment of the interests of our shareholders and our  officers, as discussed on page 51.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Once officers achieve compliance, they must also retain at least 50% of shares that vest thereafter for at least three  years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Double-trigger for cash severance payments and benefits in change-in-control agreements  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Our change-in-control agreements are  double trigger, i.e., a change in control plus termination of the executive's employment by the successor company without cause or by the executive for good reason is required to trigger cash severance payments and benefits.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  No excise tax gross-ups in any new or modified  change-in-control agreements going forward.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Risk mitigation measures  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  We use a mix of annual and long-term incentive awards and overlapping performance periods to drive current performance  in light of long-term objectives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Compensation Discussion and  Analysis 
         Compensation Discussion and  Analysis 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  The complementary and diverse performance metrics across our plans are designed to drive balanced decision-making,  consistent with our model of shareholder value creation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Annual incentive plans have been modified to cap or limit payments when earnings results fall below threshold levels.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Minimal perquisites  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Perquisites totaled less than $70,000 in fiscal 2018 for the CEO and less than $11,000 for each other NEO.   
• Independent compensation consultant  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  The Committee directly retains Pearl Meyer as its compensation consultant. Pearl Meyer does not provide any other  services to the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clawback policy to recapture incentive awards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  We have adopted a clawback policy with respect to incentive awards that requires that such awards be repaid to the  Company in the event of certain acts of fraud or misconduct that result in the material restatement of the Company's financial results.   
[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2018 Business Performance 
In fiscal 2018, we delivered our strongest financial results in the past seven years with both divisions producing strong results. We almost tripled our consolidated operating income on a year-over-year basis. We also generated 19% higher total ferrous volumes, 9% higher total nonferrous volumes, and 5% higher finished steel volumes year-over-year. Our strong results reflect the benefits from strategic initiatives to grow volumes and expand margins, supported by positive market conditions and a continued focus on productivity. 
As shown in the graphs below, we delivered significant improvements in our business performance in fiscal 2018. Our fiscal 2018 reported earnings per share of $5.46, which includes discrete tax benefits of $1.58 per share, represents a substantial increase compared to fiscal 2017 reported earnings per share of $1.60. Our return on capital employed also grew significantly in fiscal 2018. Even excluding discrete tax benefits, we achieved a return on capital employed of over 15%, demonstrating the successful execution of our growth and capital investment strategy. 
In our Auto and Metals Recycling business, we exported our ferrous and nonferrous products to 25 countries, demonstrating the flexibility of our operating platform. In our Cascade Steel and Scrap business, operating income increased more than six times year-over-year, and we continued our multi-year strategy to enhance product quality, increase productivity, and invest capital to enhance our operations. 
Our strong operating income performance in fiscal 2018 enabled us to deliver operating cash flow of $160 million and reduce our debt by 26% while continuing to invest in our Company and return capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend payments of $21 million and share repurchases of $17 million or almost 2% of total outstanding shares.

Our fiscal 2018 compensation program links pay to performance. As a result of this linkage of pay to performance, actual compensation in fiscal 2018 was higher than target levels reflecting alignment with the Company's strong financial performance as represented by the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The overall APBP performance multiple for the CEO was 2.60x and the overall AICP performance multiple for the other NEOs  was 1.66x.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For fiscal 2018, the annual incentive plans for the CEO and other NEOs included a bonus modifier based on performance  measures and target goals that were designed to drive profitable growth and achieve strategic objectives. As a result of our reaching these goals in fiscal 2018, a modifier of 7.5% was applied to and is included in the CEO's APBP  payout multiple and a modifier of 15% was applied to and is included in the other NEOs' AICP payout multiple, in each case as set forth above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance shares that vested for the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period paid out at an aggregate average of 1.48x  of target for the CEO and other NEOs.  
[END TABLE]

The Executive Compensation Process 
Role of the Compensation Committee. The Committee is responsible for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Developing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to our compensation policies and programs;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Determining the levels of all compensation to be paid to the CEO and other NEOs (including annual base salary and  incentive compensation, equity incentives, and benefit plans); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Administering and granting stock options, performance shares, RSUs, and other awards under our 1993 Amended and Restated  Stock Incentive Plan ("SIP").  
[END TABLE]
The Committee cannot delegate this authority. The Committee regularly reports its activities to the Board. 
The Committee comprises four directors, each of whom has been determined by the Board to be independent under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules, and IRS regulations. Currently, the members of the Committee are Judith A. Johansen, Chair, Wayland R. Hicks, David L. Jahnke, and Michael W. Sutherlin. The Committee operates pursuant to a written charter (available on the Company's website at http://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/compensation-committee-charter-jul-2016.pdf) which is reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis and approved by the Board. The Committee meets at least quarterly and more frequently as circumstances require, including in executive session with the Committee's independent compensation consultant. In fiscal 2018, the Committee held six meetings. 
Use of Compensation Consultants. The Committee has authority to retain compensation consultants to assist it in the evaluation of executive officer and employee compensation and benefit programs. The Committee directly retained Pearl Meyer as its compensation consultant for fiscal 2018. In fiscal 2018, Pearl Meyer performed, among others, the following services for the Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attended Committee meetings by telephone and in person as requested by the Committee and participated in executive  sessions without management present; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provided input and participated in discussions related to CEO annual and long-term incentive plan goal design and metrics  and other NEO annual and long-term incentive plan design and metrics for fiscal 2018.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee's independent compensation consultant provides information and data to the Committee from its surveys, proprietary databases and other sources, which the Committee utilizes along with information provided by management and obtained from other sources. In making its decisions, the Committee reviews such information and data provided to it by its independent compensation consultant and management and also draws on the knowledge and experience of its members as well as the expertise and information from within the Company, including from the human resources, legal, and finance groups. The Committee considers executive and director compensation matters at its quarterly meetings and at special meetings as needed based on our annual compensation schedule. 
Pearl Meyer and its affiliates did not perform any additional services for the Company or any of its affiliates in fiscal 2018. 
Separately, the Company retained Willis Towers Watson to provide management with performance data for the relative TSR calculation under the Company's Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") and to provide advice to management regarding the CEO pay ratio calculation. 
CEO's Role in the Compensation-Setting Process. The CEO, with input from Pearl Meyer, makes recommendations to the Committee regarding compensation for the other NEOs. The CEO participates in Committee meetings at the Committee's request to provide background information regarding our strategic objectives and to evaluate the performance of and make compensation recommendations for the other NEOs. The Committee utilizes the information provided by the CEO along with other information from within the Company, input from its independent compensation consultant, and the knowledge and experience of the Committee members in making compensation decisions. The Chair of the Committee recommends the CEO's compensation to the Committee in executive session, not attended by the CEO. 
Annual Evaluation. The Committee annually evaluates the performance of the NEOs with the input from the CEO and, in executive session, evaluates the performance of the CEO and determines the annual incentive bonuses for all of the NEOs for the prior fiscal year. The Committee also approves the NEOs' performance objectives for the current fiscal year, reviews and, if appropriate, adjusts their base salaries and annual incentive plan targets, and considers and approves LTIP grants. 
Performance Objectives. The Committee approved performance objectives for fiscal 2018 based, in part, on an active dialogue with the CEO regarding strategic objectives and performance targets. Metrics are tied to our strategic and business plans and to annual budgets reviewed by the full Board. Short-term management objectives, such as productivity improvements, are designed to achieve specific goals that are expected to drive long-term shareholder value.

 Metrics and targets are analyzed and tested for reasonableness prior to Committee approval at the beginning of the performance period. The Committee actively evaluates the appropriateness and rigor of the financial measures used in incentive plans and the degree of difficulty in achieving specific performance targets. As part of this evaluation, the Committee compares prior year metrics and results and also considers market and business conditions when the targets are established. The Committee believes that consideration of these factors is needed to ensure that targets are aligned with the desired degree of difficulty. The following flowchart provides an overview of the Committee's process in setting performance goals.

Competitive Market Overview. While the Committee does not believe that it is appropriate to establish compensation levels based solely on benchmarking, it believes that information regarding pay practices at peer companies is useful in two respects. First, the Committee recognizes that our compensation practices must be competitive in order to recruit and retain talented executives, and reviewing market pay practices provides a framework for assessing competitiveness. Second, marketplace information is one of the many factors that the Committee considers in assessing the reasonableness of compensation. Although the Committee considers compensation levels for executive officers of other companies, it does not mechanically apply the data but rather engages in a rigorous quantitative and qualitative review and weighing of the competitive information with other Company and individual performance factors, such as our specific business strategy, financial situation, specific duties and responsibilities, and performance, in making its compensation determinations. 
There are few, if any, direct public market peers of an equivalent size. Accordingly, determining market comparisons requires a review of companies in auto and metals recycling and in steel manufacturing, as well as companies in the closely-related mining and raw materials businesses, and in broader industrial and financial markets from which we attract executive talent. In addition, as we interface with customers around the world, we seek specialized and top caliber executive officers from the broad national and international business executive pools. Proxy data from relevant companies, as well as input from both the Company's and the Committee's compensation consultants, are utilized. Total compensation is periodically compared to the competitive market in setting compensation for executive officers. 
Based on the feedback we received from our shareholder outreach following the 2015 annual meeting, the Committee elected to adjust its peer group for fiscal 2016 to reflect current market capitalization and revenue parameters and to expand the qualitative assessment of potential compensation peers to focus on position in the value chain and exposure to international markets. For example, a company that manufactures or whose products are used to make high-value end-products would be less comparable to our business which buys, processes, and sells raw materials and produces intermediate-level products. As a result of our analysis, the 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Compensation Discussion and  Analysis 
         Compensation Discussion and  Analysis 
[END TABLE]
 Committee made significant changes to our compensation peer group for fiscal 2016 to include a broader array of companies from similar industries, including steel manufacturing, metals recycling, coal and consumable fuels, diversified metals and mining, and aluminum, while still maintaining similar size market cap and revenue demographics. There were no changes to the compensation peer group in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017. 
The Committee has established a separate performance peer group for purposes of the TSR metric in our fiscal 2018 three-
 year performance share awards. In developing the performance peer group, we used a quantitative and qualitative approach similar to that used for selecting the compensation peer group while adding companies viewed as traditional peers, who for reasons of size may not be appropriate for purposes of comparing compensation. There were no changes to the performance peer group in fiscal 2018 from fiscal 2017. The following table shows the companies in the compensation and performance peer groups used in fiscal 2018:

For performance shares awarded in fiscal 2018, the performance period is three years and the following metrics are utilized: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Relative TSR against a peer group of companies with similar financial and operational characteristics (50% weighting);  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ROCE against specific targets over the three-year performance period (50% weighting).  
[END TABLE]
Working with its independent compensation consultant, the Committee determined that TSR provides better alignment with the experience of shareholders and that ROCE, which measures how effectively we employ our capital over time, promotes efficient use of capital and long-term growth to create sustainable value for our shareholders. 
The Committee believes that our compensation programs provide an appropriate balance between: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• fixed and at-risk pay; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• short-term and long-term incentives.   
[END TABLE]
While the Committee focuses on the total compensation opportunity for the NEO and not on a specific percentage of total compensation for any particular element, a substantial portion of the compensation opportunity beyond base salary is at-risk and must be earned based upon achievement of annual and long-term performance goals. The proportion of compensation designed to be delivered in base salary versus variable pay depends on the NEO's position and the opportunity for that position to influence performance outcomes; the relative levels of compensation are based on differences in the levels and scope of responsibilities of the NEOs. Generally, the more senior the level of the NEO and the broader his or her responsibilities, the greater the amount of pay opportunity that is variable. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The relationship between fixed and variable pay in our compensation program is illustrated by the following charts, which show (i) the relative portions of base salary, target annual incentive, and target value of equity awards that, in aggregate, comprised the fiscal 2018 target total direct compensation of our CEO and of our other NEOs, and (ii) the relative portions of base salary, actual annual incentive, and grant date fair value of the equity awards that, in aggregate, comprised the fiscal 2018 actual total direct compensation of our CEO and our other NEOs. 
Components of Compensation 
Base Salary. Base salaries paid to NEOs are intended to attract and retain highly talented individuals. The Committee reviews the base salaries of our NEOs on an annual basis. Base salaries for NEOs are established on the basis of their individual performance and relevant business skills, scope of duties, and sustained contributions to our success, as well as competitive information as to similar positions in other relevant companies, taking into consideration relative company size and geographic location. 
The CEO's base salary was unchanged in fiscal 2018. Effective November 2017, the Committee approved salary adjustments for the other NEOs ranging from 3.3% to 5.1%. 
Annual Incentive Programs. The Committee approves annual performance-based compensation under the CEO's employment agreement and, for the other NEOs, under the AICP, as described below. A target bonus, expressed as a percentage of either base salary as of the end of the fiscal year or base salary paid during the fiscal year, is established for each NEO. The CEO's target bonus percentage is specified under her employment agreement (see "Employment Agreements"). For other NEOs, the Committee annually reviews the target bonus percentages and approves any adjustments, which generally take effect immediately and apply on a pro-rated basis to bonuses payable for the current fiscal year. 
Bonus Modifier. For fiscal 2018, the Committee determined that the annual incentive plans for the CEO and other NEOs include a bonus modifier based on corporate performance measures and target goals that were designed to drive profitable growth and achieve strategic objectives. The modifier was focused on incentivizing superior achievement of the AMR long-term volume and operating income per ferrous ton growth targets identified and announced in April 2017. No application of a modifier would occur if the AMR operating income target was below target (1.0x) for the fiscal year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Compensation Discussion and  Analysis

For the CEO, if achieved, a maximum bonus modifier of up to 15% would be applied to each of the two components of the APBP payout, provided that application of the modifier did not change the maximum bonus under each component. Because the financial performance component of the APBP had been achieved at the maximum 3x payout in fiscal 2018, the bonus modifier was not applied to that component. For the other NEOs, if achieved, a maximum bonus modifier of up to 15% would be applied to each NEO's total AICP payout. 
Payout under the bonus modifier was based on the achievement of the specific volume and operating income targets as determined by the Committee and described below. 
Annual Performance Bonus Program for the CEO. The employment agreement between the Company and the CEO provides for an annual bonus program consisting of two parts: a bonus based on achievement of Company financial performance goals and a bonus based on achievement of management objectives, each of which comprise 50% of the total bonus. The total target bonus opportunity under both components for each fiscal year is stated in her employment agreement to be 150% of her base salary as of the fiscal year-end, with half of the total target bonus allocated to each part. The CEO's employment agreement also provides that the maximum bonus payment is 3x target. The CEO's target bonus percentage and maximum bonus percentage have remained unchanged since May 2011. 
For the first part of the CEO's annual bonus program which is based on Company financial performance, and similar to fiscal 2017, the Committee established Adjusted EPS as the sole metric for the financial performance component of the CEO's fiscal 2018 annual bonus program. 
The second part of the CEO's annual bonus program is based on the achievement of management objectives established by the Committee. As part of its annual process, the Committee selects key objectives, the successful completion of which it believes will tie most closely to the achievement of the Company's strategic objectives and be linked to the creation of long-term shareholder value. While the Committee believes that maintaining consistency in the objectives established from year-to-year is important, it makes changes as warranted by the Company's strategic priorities and the overall market environment. 
The Committee established four management objectives for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Improvement in our workplace safety as measured by OSHA safety metrics and a key leading indicator, reflecting our  ongoing, multi-year focus in this area.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Improvement in productivity and operating costs in connection with our strategy to increase productivity, reduce costs, and drive synergies associated with the integration of CSS.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieving operating cash flow targets as a reflection of improved profitability and working capital management.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executing certain strategic objectives, including optimizing the Company's operating platform, efficient use of  capital, enhancing organizational structure and management development, volume growth, and increasing operating margins. The Committee determined that these represent important strategic objectives for our business platform, and the focus on these  metrics in the CEO's fiscal 2018 annual bonus program reflects the vital role the CEO's leadership plays in ensuring execution of the Company's strategic plan. Measurement of the achievement of these strategic objectives by the  Committee is based on the annual performance evaluation of the CEO and on quantitative factors with respect to the metrics relating to volume growth, operating margin, and capital.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee chose these management objectives since they considered achievement of such goals as critical to both the immediate and long-term profitability of the Company. In particular, they assigned a weighting of 40% of the management objectives component of the CEO's annual bonus performance program (overall APBP weighting of 20%) to the strategic objectives because they viewed achievement of those objectives as not only benefiting fiscal 2018 earnings and cash flow but also as being critical to future Company performance and shareholder value. 
For fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Target for Adjusted EPS at $1.90 was set significantly above the fiscal 2017 result of $1.53.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the safety metrics, the performance targets reflected relative improvements in the safety metrics from their  respective fiscal 2017 levels.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The productivity targets reflected improvements from their respective fiscal 2017 levels.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The target for adjusted operating cash flow for fiscal 2018 was based on assumptions regarding improved operating margins  and working capital.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The bonus modifier was based on superior achievement of the AMR volume and AMR operating income per ferrous ton long-term  growth targets identified and announced in April 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The non-income statement metrics (i.e., safety performance, productivity  improvement, and operating cash flow) were capped at 0.5x in the event adjusted earnings per share were negative.

(5)  For the CEO, if achieved, a maximum bonus modifier of up to 15% would be applied to each of the two components of the  APBP payout, provided that application of the modifier did not change the maximum bonus under each component. Because the financial performance component of the APBP had been achieved at the maximum 3x payout in fiscal 2018, the bonus modifier was  not applied to that component, resulting in an overall 7.5% modifier being applied to the CEO's APBP payout.  
[END TABLE]
Fiscal 2018 APBP Results 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong performance on both the financial and management objectives components driven in large part by the significant  increase in adjusted EPS year-over-year and the results in the adjusted operating cash flow and strategic objectives metrics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The achievement of the strategic objectives metric reflected the long-term goals which the CEO has implemented to  significantly improve the Company's operating profit, increase productivity, optimize our platform, and efficiently use our capital. In fiscal 2018, the Company delivered its strongest financial and operating performance in seven years. We also  delivered accelerated achievement on our three-year plan for higher volumes and higher operating margins, hitting our fiscal 2019 targets in fiscal 2018, notwithstanding challenging ferrous and nonferrous scrap market dynamics during the fourth  quarter. For the full year, AMR achieved operating income per ferrous ton of $46, a level last reached in fiscal 2011 when both volumes and scrap prices were significantly higher than during fiscal 2018. This operating performance demonstrates the  operating leverage created in our platform by our focus on productivity improvements and commercial initiatives to increase supply flows. CSS also significantly expanded its operating margins through benefits from productivity improvements and  higher steel prices.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The success of our strategic objectives are evidenced by our strong operating performance driven by our continued focus  on productivity and commercial initiatives, including measures to increase supply flows and nonferrous processing improvements. Our focus on capital efficiency is demonstrated by improved profitability, and operating cash flow. Our strong operating  cash flow allowed us to reduce our debt to its lowest level in eight years while also returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. These strategies reflect our overarching focus on delivering operating and  financial performance which supports long-term shareholder value.

For fiscal 2018, the Committee established a series of performance targets based on the Company's Adjusted EPS, safety, productivity improvements, and operating cash flow, which utilized the same adjustments as in the fiscal 2018 APBP. In addition, consistent with the metrics used in the fiscal 2018 APBP, the Committee determined to use adjusted operating cash flow, productivity improvements, and workplace safety as the other operating metrics for the fiscal 2018 AICP to complement the financial AICP metric. Also consistent with the fiscal 2018 APBP, the non-income statement metrics under the fiscal 2018 AICP (i.e., safety performance, productivity improvements, and operating cash flow) were capped at 0.5x in the event adjusted earnings per share were negative. For additional discussion on the target levels set for each of the fiscal 2018 AICP performance goals, see the discussion of that goal under the fiscal 2018 APBP on page 42.

The award value for performance shares covering the fiscal 2018-2020 performance period was split equally between the TSR component and the ROCE component, with the number of RSUs and the target number of performance shares under the ROCE component calculated based on the closing market price of our common stock on the determination date and the target number of performance shares under the TSR component calculated based on the fair value per share of the TSR component as determined for accounting purposes. 
LTIP awards are made by the Committee pursuant to our Policy on Employee Equity Awards, which was adopted by the Board in April 2007 and sets forth the process for granting equity awards. LTIP awards to NEOs are generally made based on grant guidelines expressed as a percentage of salary. Grant guidelines for NEOs other than the CEO are developed each year based on a review of (a) market-based LTIP grant levels, as assessed by both the Committee's and management's consultants, (b) prior year grant guidelines, and (c) CEO recommendations, taking into account performance and internal pay equity considerations, including the relative scope of the business responsibilities of each NEO, the markets in which his or her business segment operates, and his or her individual performance. Grant guidelines for the CEO are developed each year by the Committee based on a review of market-based LTIP grant levels and prior year grant guidelines and an exercise of its discretion, taking into account CEO performance. 
Our practice generally has been to determine annual LTIP award levels and make both RSU and performance share awards in November of the fiscal year. RSU awards generally vest over five years, and awards under the performance share component have historically had a three-year performance cycle. We modified this historical practice in fiscal 2012 through fiscal 2015 and used a two-year performance cycle because the Committee determined that continuing market uncertainties made establishing three-year performance targets extremely difficult. In response to the input received through the Company's shareholder outreach efforts, the Committee returned to the three-year performance cycle for awards made in fiscal 2016 and thereafter. 
The LTIP award level approved in fiscal 2018 for the CEO was 318% of her base salary at the time of the award. The grant levels for the other NEOs as a percentage of base salary were 150% for Mr. Peach, 123% for Mr. Henderson, 144% for Mr. Heiskell, and 108% for Mr. Dyck. These grants placed the officers at the levels deemed by the Committee to be appropriate and reasonable in light of their respective performance, expertise, experience, and development within roles and responsibilities. In designing the LTIP, the Committee sought to make awards within a broad range on either side of the market median to individualize the award to the level of responsibility and performance of the recipient. 
RSUs. The objective of RSUs is to align executive and shareholder long-term interests by creating a strong and direct link between executive compensation and shareholder return and to create incentives for NEOs to remain with the Company for the long term. Awarded RSUs generally vest over five years. Since fiscal 2007, we have granted RSUs instead of stock options to NEOs and other key employees to increase the equity ownership of senior management and provide a time-based retention incentive that the Committee believes better meets its compensation and retention objectives. RSU awards under the LTIP are generally made pursuant to our standard form of restricted stock unit award agreement. See "All Other Stock Awards: Number of Shares of Stock or Units" in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2018" table. 
Performance Shares. Performance-based long-term incentive awards payable in our common stock are designed to focus our NEOs on the achievement of long-term objective performance goals established by the Committee and vest only to the extent those performance goals are met. Because awards are based on a three-year performance period, they maximize the leverage of both short- and long-term performance. The impact of a single year's performance is felt in each of three performance share grants that are outstanding at any given time, so that strong performance must be sustained every year in order to provide favorable payouts. This element of executive compensation closely connects NEOs to the Company's financial and stock performance over the short- and long-term and acts as a retention tool. 
Selection of Fiscal 2018-2020 Performance Measures. For performance shares awarded in November 2017, the following metrics were utilized: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• TSR relative to a peer group of companies with similar financial and operational characteristics; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ROCE against specific targets over the performance period.  
[END TABLE]
We believe TSR is an appropriate measure because it inherently reflects relevant financial and operational results as share price is a reflection of our current and expected future performance and directly links a significant portion of NEO compensation to shareholder value creation. ROCE, which measures how effectively we employ our capital over time, was chosen to promote efficient use of capital and long-term growth to create sustainable value for our shareholders. ROCE balances the cyclical nature of commodity prices and the investments required to support working capital. 
In tandem, we believe that these metrics drive the behaviors of our management team in ways that are intended to create the most value for our shareholders.

[END TABLE]
TSR, including reinvested dividends, will be calculated for each year of the three-year performance period for the Company and each performance peer group company, except that for the first year of the performance period TSR is measured from the grant date of the award to the fiscal year end. The TSR of the Company and each of the performance peer group companies is then ranked based on their respective TSR's from lowest to highest. The average of the Company's TSR percentile rank for each of the three fiscal years will then be used to determine the overall relative level of TSR performance. The TSR payout level will be based on the percentile rank of our average TSR as compared to the performance peer group, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Average TSR Percentile Rank       TSR Payout   Factor   
   Average TSR Percentile Rank       TSR Payout   Factor less than 25%       0.0x less than 25%       0.0x  
     25%       0.5x

     90% or more       2.0x  
     90% or more       2.0x  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that using an average of the Company's relative TSR for each year of the three-year performance period was warranted to limit the possibility of disproportionate payouts, either positive or negative, as a result of sharp stock price movements toward the end of the three-year performance period. The performance share award also contains a "positive TSR" modifier whereby if our TSR is negative when measured over the full performance period, the maximum TSR payout factor is limited to 1.0x even if the relative TSR would have resulted in a greater payout factor. In addition, the performance share award contains an overall cap which provides that the maximum value (including stock price appreciation) of shares payable under the TSR metric at the time of payment is limited to 4.0x the value of the target number of shares under the TSR metric on the date of grant of the performance share award. See "The Executive Compensation Process – Competitive Market Overview" for the listing of performance peer group companies used in fiscal 2018. 
The ROCE metric is based on the average of the ROCEs achieved by the Company in each of the three years of the performance period. ROCE for each year is defined as (a) net income, excluding interest expense, divided by (b) average capital employed which is generally equal to total assets minus total liabilities other than debt and capital lease obligations. ROCE for each fiscal year will be adjusted to eliminate the impacts of impairments of goodwill or other assets; certain environmental accruals and expenses; restructuring charges and other exit-related activities; business acquisitions or combinations completed or reviewed in fiscal 2020; changes in accounting principles; charges to reduce the recorded value of any inventory to net realizable value; and the discrete income tax impact of the foregoing adjustments. 
The Committee established the ROCE performance targets based on a variety of factors, including our budget for fiscal 2018, recent historical performance, most recent forecasts and expected impacts of growth initiatives, expected returns on capital expenditures and other uses of capital, and the cyclical nature of our business. In light of these circumstances, the Committee believes this three-year target is challenging but achievable. The ROCE payout level will be determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Three-Year Average ROCE Performance       ROCE Payout   Factor     
   Three-Year Average ROCE Performance       ROCE Payout   Factor     
     More than 3% below  target       0%  
     More than 3% below  target       0%  
     3% below target       50%  
     3% below target       50%  
     At Target       100%  
     At Target       100%  
     2.40% or more above target       200%  
     2.40% or more above target       200%  
[END TABLE]
We consider the ROCE targets for uncompleted performance periods to be confidential financial information, the disclosure of which would result in competitive harm to us because they would reveal information about our growth profile and the effects of anticipated capital expenditures and corporate acquisitions, none of which is otherwise made public.

Summary of Outstanding Performance Awards 
Fiscal 2016-2018 Results and Payouts. In recognition of market conditions existing at the time, the Committee determined that for fiscal 2016 it would consider the long-term incentive awards in two stages: a grant in November 2015 at generally 50% of the previous year grant levels and a review at mid-year based on the Company's financial and operating performance for the remaining 50%. Based on that mid-year review, in April 2016, the Committee determined to grant the second half of fiscal 2016 LTIP awards. For performance shares awarded in November 2015, the performance period was set at three years. When granting the second half of fiscal 2016 performance shares in April 2016, the Committee set the performance period as the remaining 2 1/2 years of the fiscal 2016-2018 period. 
For both fiscal 2016 performance share awards, the following metrics were utilized: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• TSR relative to a peer group of companies with similar financial and operational characteristics (weighted at 50%); and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CFROI against specific targets over the performance period (weighted at 50%).  
[END TABLE]
TSR was defined essentially the same as that term was defined in the fiscal 2018-2020 awards described above. The CFROI metric was based on average of the CFROIs achieved by the Company in each of the three years of the performance period. CFROI for each year was defined as (a) net cash provided by operating activities less net capital expenditures, divided by (b) average capital employed which is generally equal to total assets minus total liabilities other than debt and capital lease obligations. CFROI for each fiscal year was adjusted to eliminate the impacts of impairments of goodwill or other assets; certain environmental expenses; restructuring charges and other exit-related activities announced in final six months of fiscal 2018; business acquisitions or combinations completed or reviewed in fiscal 2018; discrete income tax adjustments; and changes in accounting principles.

A participant generally must be employed by us on the October 31 following the end of the performance period to receive an award payout, although adjusted awards, pro-rated based on the period of employment during the performance period, will be paid subject to the terms of the applicable award agreement if employment terminates earlier on account of death, disability, retirement, termination without cause after the first year of the performance period, or a sale of the Company. Awards will be paid in Class A common stock as soon as practicable after the October 31 following the end of the performance period. Violation of certain non-competition covenants during the first year following termination of employment will trigger an obligation to repay any award paid out in the preceding year. See the "Stock Awards" column in the "Summary Compensation Table" and "Estimated Future 
 Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards" column in the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in Fiscal 2018" table. 
Executive Benefits. Our executive benefits are intended, along with base salary, to provide a competitive fixed pay foundation for the work being performed by the executive. NEOs are eligible to participate in benefit plans available to non-executive employees and to receive additional benefits as described below as part of the compensation package we believe is necessary to attract and retain the desired level of executive talent. 
Retirement Plans. We maintain 401(k) plans and a Pension Retirement Plan (the "Pension Plan") for our employees, including the NEOs. The Pension Plan was "frozen" as of June 30, 2006, and no additional benefits have been accrued for participants since that date. 
We also maintain a Supplemental Executive Retirement Bonus Plan ("SERBP") in which the CEO participates. We have not added any participants to the SERBP since 2005. See "Pension Benefits at Fiscal 2018 Year End" for

 descriptions of the Pension Plan and the SERBP and information regarding benefits payable to the NEOs under the Pension Plan and the SERBP. 
Change-in-Control Agreements. To ensure that we offer competitive compensation to our NEOs, and to attract and retain top executive talent, we offer severance benefits under change-in-control agreements as part of our executive compensation packages. The purpose of these agreements is to ensure that we will have the continued attention and dedication of our senior executives during a potential change in control. The Committee believes these agreements are in the best interest of shareholders by providing certainty as to what executives would receive in a change in control, enabling them to remain focused on the business during a period of uncertainty. In April 2008, the Committee approved a change-in-control severance agreement for Messrs. Peach and Dyck. In October 2008, the Committee approved an amended change-in-control agreement with Ms. Lundgren, which amended and restated her change-in-control agreement entered into in March 2006. In 2011, the Committee approved a revised form of change-in-control agreement, which does not include any tax gross-up provisions, and this form has been used for agreements with Messrs. Henderson and Heiskell. The specific terms of the change-in-control agreements and the potential benefits payable under the agreements are discussed under "Compensation of Executive Officers – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control" below. At the times the agreements currently in effect were approved, the Committee received advice from Pearl Meyer, and the Company received advice from Willis Towers Watson, that the terms were competitive and consistent with market practices. 
Indemnity Agreements. We have entered into indemnity agreements with each NEO pursuant to which we agree to indemnify such officer in connection with claims or proceedings involving the officer (by reason of serving as a director or officer of the Company or its subsidiaries), as provided in the agreement. 
Other Benefits. Certain executive officers receive a monthly automobile allowance and use of a Company-provided credit card for fuel purchases. Both amounts are taxable to the executive as compensation income. Certain executive officers also participate in a supplemental executive medical benefits plan which provides full coverage of certain medical and dental expenses (including deductibles and co-payments) not covered by our basic medical and dental plans. 
Employment Agreements 
We entered into an employment agreement with our CEO in connection with her initial employment. In October 2008, we entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with our CEO, which became effective on December 1, 2008 in connection with her becoming President and CEO, and which superseded the prior agreement. That agreement was further amended in June 2011 and July 2017. 
Our CEO's employment agreement governs the terms and conditions of her employment as CEO through December 1, 2020, provided that on December 1, 2018, and on each December 1 thereafter, the employment agreement automatically extends for an additional one-year period unless we or our CEO elects not to extend the term. On December 1, 2018 her employment agreement was automatically extended for an additional one-year period (i.e., through December 1, 2021). Our CEO's target bonus of 150% of year-end base salary and a maximum bonus payment of 3x target have remained unchanged since May 2011. 
In the event that our CEO's employment is terminated by us without cause, including our decision not to extend the term of the employment agreement, or by our CEO for good reason and not under circumstances that would give rise to severance payments to our CEO under her change-in-control agreement, our CEO would be entitled to receive severance and other benefits as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-in-Control." These benefits were negotiated as part of her original employment agreement in 2005. 
Executive Officer Incentive Compensation Recoupment ("Clawback") Policy 
The Company has a written policy to address the recoupment of incentive-based compensation, whether paid in cash or in equity, awarded to or earned by an executive officer whose intentional acts, or failure to act, are responsible in whole, or in part, for the material restatement of the Company's publicly filed financial statements due to fraud or misconduct, including gross negligence. In the event of such a restatement, the Compensation Committee will determine: (i) the time period involved with, and subsequent periods affected by, any such fraud or misconduct, and (ii) the amount of incentive compensation that should be recouped in each case if such fraud or misconduct is determined to have occurred.

Officer Stock Ownership Policy 
To promote the long-term alignment of the interests of our officers and shareholders, we adopted the Officer Stock Ownership Policy. The policy requires each of our officers to accumulate ownership of Class A common stock with a value equal to the following multiples of base salary: CEO: 5x; Senior Vice Presidents: 2x; and Vice Presidents: 1x. To reduce the impact of stock price fluctuations on an officer's ongoing obligation to achieve and maintain compliance with this policy, shares purchased in the open market are valued at cost, shares acquired under RSUs or performance share awards are valued at the market price on vesting, and shares acquired under stock options are valued at the market price at the time of exercise of the option, and these values remain constant. Until the requisite level of ownership is achieved, officers are required to retain at least 50% of the shares (net of shares withheld to cover taxes or sold to cover the option exercise price and taxes) received under RSUs, stock options, and performance share awards. The policy also requires officers who have achieved compliance to thereafter maintain at least the minimum ownership level and to retain 50% of the net shares received thereafter under RSUs, stock options, and performance share awards for at least three years. Ms. Lundgren, Messrs. Peach and Dyck have each achieved the minimum ownership required, and each of the other NEOs was otherwise in compliance with the policy as of August 31, 2018. 
Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") imposes an annual deduction limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation paid to each of the CEO and certain other NEOs. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA"), the deduction limit did not apply to performance-based compensation satisfying the requirements of Section 162(m). However, the exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for the Company's fiscal 2019 tax year. As a result, compensation paid to our NEOs after fiscal 2018 in excess of 
 $1 million will generally not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain binding contracts in place as of November 2, 2017 and which were not materially modified after that date. The policy of the Committee is to structure executive compensation to maximize the deductibility of compensation where feasible consistent with our overall compensation objectives. Preserving deductibility is not the only goal for the Company's executive compensation program, however, and the Committee retains the discretion to award compensation that is nondeductible.

(4)  Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs and LTIP performance share awards computed in accordance with  FASB ASC Topic 718. The grant date fair value of the RSUs is equal to the value of the underlying restricted shares based on the closing market price of the Company's Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant  date. The grant date fair value of the LTIP performance share awards under the ROCE metric is calculated by multiplying the target number of shares issuable under the award by the closing market price of the Company's Class A common stock  on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on the grant date. The grant date fair value of the LTIP performance share awards under the TSR metric is estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model.

(1)  The Pension Retirement Plan Present Value of Accumulated Benefit in the above table represents the actuarial present  value as of August 31, 2018 of each NEO's frozen pension benefit, assuming commencement of benefit payments at age 65. Benefit accruals under that plan ceased when the plan was frozen on June 30, 2006, but years of service are still  relevant for purposes of satisfying the five-year vesting requirement. The SERBP Present Value of Accumulated Benefit in the table above represents the actuarial present value as of August 31, 2018 of the CEO's pension benefit calculated  based on years of credited service and the maximum SERBP benefit level as of that date and assuming commencement of benefit payments one year from the determination date. Actuarial present values were calculated using a discount rate of 3.97% with  respect to the Pension Retirement Plan and 3.89% with respect to the SERBP, and the RP-2014 generational mortality tables with mortality improvement scale MP-2017, the  same assumptions used in the pension benefit calculations reflected in the Company's audited consolidated balance sheet for the year ended August 31, 2018.

Defined Benefit Retirement Plans 
Pension Retirement Plan. The Company's Pension Plan is a defined benefit plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. Persons who were non-union employees of the Company prior to May 15, 2006 are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. Benefit accruals ceased on June 30, 2006. Generally, pension benefits become fully vested after five years of service and are paid in monthly installments beginning upon the later of retirement or age 65. Benefits accrued each year after August 31, 1986 and prior to June 30, 2006 in an amount equal to 2% of qualifying compensation earned in the applicable year. Qualifying compensation included base salary, subject to a legal limit for the year. Retirement benefits are payable at any time after termination of employment, subject to actuarial reduction for early start of payment before age 65. A participant may choose payment from various actuarial equivalent life annuity options or a lump sum. Death benefits are payable to a beneficiary in a lump sum; a surviving spouse may elect payment as a life annuity. 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Bonus Plan. The SERBP was adopted to provide a competitive level of retirement income for key executive officers selected by the Board. SERBP benefits become fully vested after five years of continuous service. The SERBP establishes an annual target benefit for each participant based on continuous years of service. The target benefit is an annual amount paid for the life of the employee, which is the lesser of (i) the product of 2.6% and the average of the participant's five consecutive calendar years of highest compensation ("Final Average Compensation") multiplied by years of continuous service, but in no event more than 65% of Final Average Compensation, or (ii) the product of $291,856 (subject to annual adjustment) multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the employee's continuous years of service and the denominator of which is the greater of the number of continuous years of service or 25. Compensation includes all cash compensation from an employer that participates in the SERBP, including salary and adjusted bonus, without taking into account voluntary reductions. Adjusted bonus means the lesser of (i) the bonus amount paid or (ii) 25% of salary during the period for which the bonus was earned. The target benefit is reduced by 100% of primary social security benefits and the Company-paid portion of all benefits payable under the Company's qualified retirement plans to determine the actual benefit payable under the SERBP. The actual benefit will be paid as a straight life annuity or in other actuarially equivalent forms chosen by the participant commencing on the later of retirement or age 60. A participant who retires before age 60 with at least 10 years of continuous service will receive an early retirement benefit commencing on the later of retirement or age 55 equal to the normal retirement benefit reduced by 4% for each year by which commencement of benefits precedes age 60. The CEO is the only NEO who participates in the SERBP and has reached the normal retirement age under the SERBP. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Potential Payments Upon a Change in Control 
The Company has entered into a change-in-control agreement with the CEO which provides certain benefits if her employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by her for "good reason" during a six-month period preceding a "change in control" of the Company or within 24 months after a "change in control" of the Company. In this agreement, "change in control" is generally defined to include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition by any person of 20 percent or more of the Company's outstanding Class A common stock;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nomination (and subsequent election) of a majority of the Company's directors by persons other than the  incumbent directors; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or an acquisition of the Company  through a merger or share exchange.  
[END TABLE]
"Cause" generally includes willful and continued failure to substantially perform assigned duties or willfully engaging in illegal conduct injurious to the Company, and "good reason" generally includes a change in position or responsibilities that does not represent a promotion, a decrease in compensation, or a base office relocation. 
The Company has also entered into change-in-control agreements with the other NEOs which provide certain benefits if the officer's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the officer for "good reason" within 18 months after a "change in control" of the Company. These agreements contain definitions of "change in control," "cause," and "good reason" which are substantially identical to those contained in the change-in-control agreement for the CEO. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Compensation of Executive  Officers 
         Compensation of Executive  Officers 
[END TABLE]
The Company granted LTIP performance shares to the NEOs in fiscal 2016, 2017, and 2018 pursuant to which shares of Class A common stock will be issued based on the Company's performance during the applicable performance periods relating to the awards. The award agreements relating to the LTIP performance shares provide for an accelerated payout of the performance shares upon a "Company sale," which generally means a sale of the Company by means of a merger, share exchange, or sale of substantially all of the assets of the Company. In addition, award agreements relating to all outstanding RSUs provide for accelerated vesting on a change in control of the Company (which has the same meaning as under the change-in-control agreements). An accelerated payout of LTIP performance shares and accelerated vesting of RSUs would occur even if the NEO's employment was not terminated in connection with the Company sale or change in control. 
The following table sets forth the estimated change-in-control benefits that would have been payable to each NEO if a change in control (including a Company sale) had occurred on August 31, 2018 and, except as noted, each officer's employment had been terminated on that date either by the Company without "cause" or by the officer with "good reason."

(2)  LTIP Performance Shares Acceleration. Under the terms of the standard LTIP performance share awards, if an  NEO's employment is terminated due to death or disability prior to the vesting date, the officer (or his or her estate) would receive a payout in an amount equal to the payout calculated as if the performance period had ended on the last day of  the Company's most recently completed fiscal quarter prior to the date of employment termination, taking into account provisions in the award agreement for calculating performance for a shorter performance period and a partial year, and pro-rated for the portion of the performance period the officer had worked. The amounts in the table above represent the value of outstanding LTIP performance share awards that would vest and be paid out pursuant to  the terms of the award agreements on death or disability based on a stock price of $26.35 per share, which was the closing price of the Company's Class A common stock on August 31, 2018, the last trading day of fiscal 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Pursuant to requirements established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the SEC rules and guidance adopted thereunder, we have evaluated the compensation of the Company's CEO with the compensation of the Company's median paid employee. The pay ratio information presented below is based upon a selected methodology which includes reasonable estimates calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
We determined the median compensated employee based upon review of annual compensation for all employees as of July 31, 2018. The measure of compensation used to identify our median employee was consistently applied to all employees and included: salary, base wages and overtime (as applicable), incentive payments, health and welfare benefits, retirement contributions, and other cash payments. To facilitate comparability among our employee population, we annualized compensation for employees who started mid-year and applied a local currency to U.S. dollar exchange rate to translate non-U.S. employee compensation to U.S. dollars. After determining the median employee, the annual compensation for our median employee was calculated in a manner consistent with the CEO's annual total compensation reflected in the Summary Compensation Table and then adjusted to include the value of health benefits provided to the median employee during the fiscal year. 
For the purpose of calculating the CEO pay ratio, the CEO compensation was determined to be $9,100,109, which matches the sum of Ms. Lundgren's annual total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table plus health benefits of $11,574. The annual total compensation for our median employee was $55,469. As a result, Ms. Lundgren's annual total compensation for 2018 was approximately 164 times that of our median employee. 
The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to utilize different methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee population and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to our CEO pay ratio.

Proposal No. 2 – Advisory Resolution on Executive Compensation 
As required pursuant to section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, we are including in these proxy materials a separate resolution to approve, in a non-binding, advisory vote ("Say-on-Pay vote"), the compensation paid to our named executive officers as disclosed on pages 31 through 62. While the results of the vote are non-binding and advisory in nature, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee intend to carefully consider the results of this vote. 
We hold our Say-on-Pay vote every year and, unless the Board of Directors modifies its policy on the frequency of Say-on-Pay votes, the next Say-on-Pay vote will occur at our annual meeting to be held in 2020. 
The text of the resolution in respect of Proposal No. 2 is as follows: 
RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and any related narrative discussion. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR this resolution because it believes that our executive compensation policies and practices described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis are effective in achieving the Company's goals of rewarding sustained financial and operating performance and leadership excellence, aligning the executives' long-term interests with those of the shareholders, and motivating the executives to remain with the Company for long and productive careers. We believe our performance targets are meaningful and rigorous and are designed to encourage our executives to perform at the highest levels. The executive pay outcomes in fiscal 2018 are reflective of Company performance. 
Our executive compensation program is designed to pay for performance, therefore actual compensation in fiscal 2018 was higher than target levels, which reflected alignment with the Company's financial performance during the period. 
Vote Required to Approve, on an Advisory Basis, the Executive Compensation 
Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on this proposal, and each share is entitled to one vote. The advisory vote on executive compensation will be approved if the votes cast favoring the proposal exceed the votes cast opposing the proposal. The proxies will be voted for or against the proposal or as an abstention in accordance with the instructions specified on the proxy form. If no instructions are given by owners of record, proxies will be voted for approval of the executive compensation. 
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
Proposal No. 3 – Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected the firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending August 31, 2019, subject to ratification of this selection by the shareholders of the Company. 
While the Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee and the Board are submitting the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance. The Audit Committee is not required to take any action as a result of the outcome of the vote on this proposal. However, if our shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will consider whether to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore, even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders. 
For additional information regarding our relationship with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, please refer to "Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" and "Audit Committee Report" below. 
One or more representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. Such representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires to do so, and will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Vote Required to Approve the Ratification of the Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on this proposal, and each share is entitled to one vote. The ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm will be approved if the votes cast favoring the proposal exceed the votes cast opposing the proposal. The proxies will be voted for or against the proposal or as an abstention in accordance with the instructions specified on the proxy form. If no instructions are given by owners of record, proxies will be voted for approval of the ratification of the selection. 
The Board of Directors recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" to approve the ratification of the selection of independent registered public accounting firm.

The Audit Committee may delegate authority to pre-approve audit and non-audit services to any member of the Audit Committee but may not delegate such authority to management. All compensation for services performed by our independent accountants must be approved by the Audit Committee. 
Audit Committee Report 
The principal functions of the Audit Committee are set forth in its charter and are described above at page 24. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets all additional independence and financial literacy requirements for Audit Committee membership under the SEC and NASDAQ rules and is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in the regulations adopted by the SEC. 
The Audit Committee reports as follows with respect to fiscal 2018: 
Financial Reporting and Other Activities 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Management is responsible for the Company's systems of internal control and the financial reporting process. The  Audit Committee reviewed the Company's quarterly earnings press releases, annual audited consolidated financial statements, management's report on internal control over financial reporting, and related periodic reports filed with the SEC and discussed them with management. Management  represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee also reviewed and  discussed the annual audited consolidated financial statements with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2018, including a discussion of the quality, and not just  the acceptability, of the accounting principles used and the reasonableness of significant judgments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee discussed with management on a quarterly basis the details of the Company's material legal and  environmental matters, certain judgmental accounting matters and other significant financial transactions occurring within each quarter, reviewing and approving, as appropriate, all transactions with related persons, the Company's compliance  program, reports received through the Company's whistleblower hotline, and other selected risk-related topics.  
[END TABLE]
Internal Audit and External Audit Firm Functions 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal auditor and PwC the overall scope and plans for their  respective audits. The Audit Committee met quarterly with the internal auditor and PwC to discuss the results of their examinations and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee's quarterly meetings with internal audit included reviews of the risk assessment process used to  establish the annual audit plan and the progress on completion of that plan including testing of controls in connection with the Company's compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Audit Firm Independence 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the  independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's financial statements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PwC has served as the Company's auditor since 1976, which includes periods before the Company became public in  fiscal 1993. In determining whether to reappoint PwC, the Audit Committee takes into consideration various factors, including: the historical and recent performance of PwC on the audit; its professional qualifications; the quality of ongoing  discussions with   
       PwC; external data, including recent PCAOB reports on PwC and its peer firms; the appropriateness of fees and PwC's tenure, including the benefits of that tenure, and the controls and  processes in place (such as rotation of key partners every five years) that help ensure PwC's continued independence in the face of such tenure. The Audit Committee believes there are significant benefits to having an independent auditor with  an extensive history with the Company. These include:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Higher quality audit work and accounting advice, due to PwC's institutional knowledge of our business and  operations, accounting policies and financial systems, and internal control framework; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   –  Operational efficiencies because of PwC's history and familiarity with our business.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee received from PwC the written disclosures required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's independence. The Audit Committee discussed with PwC the firm's independence from the Company and its management. 
Conclusion 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that  the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee also has selected PwC to be the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for  fiscal 2019, subject to shareholder ratification.
