QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
   Proxy Materials and Voting Information  
[BEGIN TABLE]
     1.    What is included in the proxy materials? What is a proxy statement and what is a proxy?    
[END TABLE]
The proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting include the Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K to shareholders for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 (the "Annual Report" and, together with the other materials, the "proxy materials"). If you request a paper copy of these materials, the proxy materials will also include a proxy card or voting instruction form. 
A proxy statement is a document that the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations require the Company to give you when it asks you to return a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the shares you own. That other person is called your proxy. We are asking you to designate the following three persons as your proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting: Jennifer B. Clark, Managing Director, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Matthew P. Jordan, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Adam D. Portnoy, Managing Director, President and Chief Executive Officer. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2.    What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?    
[END TABLE]
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's registrar and transfer agent, Equiniti Shareowner Services, you are considered a shareholder of record of those shares. If you are a shareholder of record, you should receive only one notice or proxy card for all the Class A Common Shares you hold in certificate form and in book entry form. 
If your shares are held in an account you own at a bank or brokerage or you hold shares through another nominee, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares. If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive voting instruction information from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you own your Class A Common Shares. 
If you hold some shares of record and some shares beneficially, you should receive a notice or proxy card for all the Class A Common Shares you hold of record and a separate voting instruction form for the shares from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you own Class A Common Shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     3.    What different methods can I use to vote?    
[END TABLE]
By Written Proxy. All shareholders of record can submit voting instructions by written proxy card. If you are a shareholder of record and receive a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, you may request a written proxy card by following the instructions included in the notice. If you are a beneficial owner, you may request a written proxy card or a voting instruction form from your bank, broker or other nominee. Proxies submitted by mail must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on April 2, 2019 or, if the meeting is postponed or adjourned to a later date, by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the day immediately preceding the date of the reconvened meeting. 
By Telephone or Internet. All shareholders of record also can authorize a proxy to vote their shares by touchtone telephone by calling 1-800-690-6903, or through the internet at www.proxyvote.com, using the procedures and instructions described in your Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials or 
THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement    5 
proxy card. Beneficial owners may authorize a proxy by telephone or internet if their bank, broker or other nominee makes those methods available, in which case the bank, broker or nominee will include the instructions with the proxy voting materials. To authorize a proxy by telephone or internet, you will need the 16 digit control number provided on your Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy card or voting instruction form. The telephone and internet proxy authorization procedures are designed to authenticate shareholder identities, to allow shareholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. Proxies submitted by telephone or through the internet must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on April 2, 2019 or, if the meeting is postponed or adjourned to a later date, by 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on the day immediately preceding the date of the reconvened meeting. 
In Person. All shareholders of record may vote in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners may vote in person at the meeting if they have a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 15. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 6    THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    6.    What if I am a shareholder of record and do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy card or authorizing a proxy by internet or telephone?    
[END TABLE]
If you return a signed proxy card or authorize a proxy by internet or telephone and do not specify a choice for a matter, you will be instructing your proxy to vote in the manner recommended by the Board on that matter:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    7.    What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my broker?    
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner and do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, the following applies: 
 Non-Discretionary Items.    The election of Directors is a non-discretionary item and may not be voted on by brokers, banks or other nominees who have not received specific voting instructions from beneficial owners. The result of the inability of a broker, bank or other nominee to vote on a non-discretionary item for which it has not received specific voting instructions from beneficial owners is referred to as a broker non-vote. 
 Discretionary Items.    The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as independent auditors is a discretionary item. Generally, banks, brokers and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal in their discretion. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     8.    What is a quorum? How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted?    
[END TABLE]
A quorum of shareholders is required for shareholders to take action at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the 2019 Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present. Abstentions are not votes cast and, therefore, will not be included in vote totals and will have no effect on the outcome of any Item to be voted on at the 2019 Annual Meeting. A proxy marked "WITHHOLD" with respect to Item 1 will have the same effect as an abstention. Broker non-votes are not votes cast and, therefore, will not be included in vote totals and will have no effect on the outcome of Item 1. There can be no broker non-votes on Item 2 as it is a matter on which, if you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares, the nominee has discretionary authority to vote on your behalf. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    9.    What may I do if I change my mind after I authorize a proxy to vote my shares?    
[END TABLE]
Shareholders have the right to revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting, subject to the proxy voting deadlines described above. Shareholders may revoke a proxy by authorizing a proxy again on a later date by internet or by telephone (only the last internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the meeting will be counted) or by signing and returning a later dated proxy card or by attending the meeting and voting in person. If you are a beneficial owner, see the response to question 15. 
THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement    7 
A shareholder's attendance at the 2019 Annual Meeting will not revoke that shareholder's proxy unless that shareholder votes again at the meeting or sends an original written statement to the Secretary of the Company revoking the prior proxy. An original written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be delivered to The RMR Group Inc., Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458, Attention: Secretary, or hand delivered to the Secretary before the taking of the vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Beneficial owners who wish to change their votes should contact the organization that holds their shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report are available at www.proxyvote.com. You may access these proxy materials on the internet through the conclusion of the 2019 Annual Meeting.

[END TABLE]
The Company bears all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies. We will request banks, brokers and other nominees to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners of Class A Common Shares and to obtain their voting instructions. We will reimburse those firms for their expenses of forwarding proxy materials. 
Proxies may also be solicited, without additional compensation, by the Company's and its subsidiaries' directors, officers and employees, by mail, telephone or other electronic means or in person. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    13.    What is householding?

    Director Qualifications    
[END TABLE]
Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company's business. This significant responsibility requires highly skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes and professional experience. The Board believes that there are general requirements that are applicable to all Directors, qualifications applicable to Independent Directors and other skills and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole, but not necessarily by each Director. In accordance with our Charter and Bylaws, the Board consists of five Directors: two Managing Directors and three Independent Directors. As set forth in our Bylaws, Independent Directors are Directors who are not employees of the Company, are not involved in the Company's day to day activities and are persons who qualify as independent under the applicable rules of the Nasdaq and the SEC. As set forth in our Bylaws, Managing Directors are Directors who are not Independent Directors and who have been employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or involved in the day to day activities of the Company, any of its subsidiaries or any of their predecessors for at least one year prior to such Director's election. The Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee consider the qualifications of Directors and Director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board's overall composition and the Company's current and future needs. 
   Qualifications for All Directors  
In its assessment of each potential candidate, including those recommended by shareholders, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers the potential nominee's integrity, experience, achievements, judgment, intelligence, competence, personal character, likelihood that a candidate will be 
THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement    11 
able to serve on the Board for an extended period and other matters that the Nominating and Governance Committee deems appropriate. The Nominating and Governance Committee also takes into account the ability of a potential nominee to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company. 
The Board and Nominating and Governance Committee require that each Director candidate be a person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field. Each Director candidate must demonstrate the ability to make independent analytical inquiries, familiarity with and respect for corporate governance requirements and practices and a commitment to serving the Company's long term best interests. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee may conduct interviews of potential Director candidates to assess intangible qualities, including the individual's ability to ask appropriate questions and to work collegially. The Board does not have a specific diversity policy in connection with the selection of nominees for Director, but due consideration is given to the Board's overall balance of diversity, including perspectives, backgrounds and experiences. 
   Specific Qualifications, Attributes, Skills and Experience to be Represented on the Board  
The Board has identified particular qualifications, attributes, skills and experience that are important to be represented on the Board as a whole, in light of the Company's long term interests.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board regarding cash compensation paid to Directors and the Equity Plan Committee, a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee, is responsible for determining and approving the Class A Common Shares awarded to Directors, in each case, for Board, committee and committee chair services. Managing Directors do not receive cash compensation for their services as Directors but do receive Class A Common Share awards for their Board service. The number of Class A Common Shares awarded to each Managing Director for Board service is the same as the number awarded to each Independent Director. 
In determining the amount and composition of our Directors' compensation, the Compensation Committee (including the Equity Plan Committee) and the Board take various factors into consideration, including, but not limited to, the responsibilities of Directors generally, as well as for service on committees and as committee chairs, and the forms of compensation paid to directors or trustees by comparable companies, including the compensation of directors and trustees of other companies managed by RMR LLC. The Board reviews the Compensation Committee's recommendations regarding Director cash compensation and determines and approves the amount of such compensation.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
 The Company is committed to corporate governance that promotes the long term interests of our shareholders. The Board has established Governance Guidelines that provide a framework for effective governance. The guidelines address matters such as general qualification standards for the Board, Director responsibilities, Board meetings and communications, Board committees, Director access to management and independent advisors, Director compensation, Director orientation and continuing education, executive development and succession planning, related person transactions, annual performance evaluation of the Board and other matters. The Board regularly reviews developments in corporate governance and updates our Governance Guidelines and other governance materials as it deems necessary and appropriate. 
The governance section of our website makes available our corporate governance materials, including the Governance Guidelines, the charter for each Board committee, the Code and information about how to report concerns or complaints about accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and any violations or possible violations of the Code and how to communicate with our Directors, individually or as a group. To access these documents on the Company's website, www.rmrgroup.com, click on "Investors & Media" and then click on "Corporate Governance." In addition, instructions on how to obtain copies of the Company's corporate governance materials are included in the response to question 16 in the "Questions and Answers" section on page 10. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board Leadership Structure    
[END TABLE]
In accordance with our Charter and Bylaws, the Board is comprised of five Directors, including three Independent Directors and two Managing Directors. All Directors play an active role in overseeing the Company's business both at the Board and committee levels. As set forth in the Company's Governance Guidelines, the core responsibility of our Directors is to exercise sound, informed and independent business judgment in overseeing the Company and its strategic direction. Our Directors are skilled and experienced leaders and currently serve or have served as members of senior management in public and private for profit and nonprofit organizations, and also have served as government officials. Our Directors may be called upon to provide solutions to various complex issues and are expected to, and do, ask hard questions of the Company's officers and advisors. The Board is small, which facilitates informal discussions and communication from management to the Board and among Directors. 
We do not have a Chairman of the Board or a lead Independent Director. Other than Jennifer Clark and Adam Portnoy, our executive officers are not members of the Board, but they and the Company's Director of Internal Audit may attend Board and Board committee meetings at the invitation of the Board. The Company's President or the Board may call a special meeting of the Board. 
Pursuant to the Company's Governance Guidelines, the Company's Independent Directors are expected to meet in regularly scheduled meetings at which only Independent Directors are present. The presiding Director at these meetings is the Chair of the Audit Committee, unless the Independent Directors in attendance select another Independent Director to preside. Our Independent Directors may also meet to consider Company business without the attendance of the Managing Directors or other officers, and they meet separately with the Company's officers, with the Company's Director of Internal Audit and with the Company's independent auditors. In such meetings of the Company's Independent Directors, the Chair of the Audit Committee presides unless the Independent Directors determine otherwise. 
In the fiscal year 2018, the Board held nine meetings. In fiscal year 2018, each Director attended 75% or more of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during the period he or she served as a Director. All of the Directors attended last year's annual meeting of shareholders. The Company's policy with respect to Board members' attendance at meetings of the Board and annual meetings of shareholders can be found in the Company's Governance Guidelines, the full text of which appears at the Company's website,  www.rmrgroup.com.

[BEGIN TABLE]
   Independence of Directors    
[END TABLE]
Under the corporate governance listing standards of the Nasdaq, to be considered independent:
The Board affirmatively determines whether Directors have a direct or indirect material relationship with the Company, including the Company's subsidiaries, other than serving as the Company's Directors or directors of the Company's subsidiaries. In making independence determinations, the Board observes Nasdaq and SEC criteria, as well as the criteria in our Bylaws. When assessing a Director's relationship with the Company, the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances, not merely from the Director's standpoint, but also from that of the persons or organizations with which the Director has an affiliation. Based on this review, the Board has determined that Ann Logan, Rosen Plevneliev and Walter C. Watkins, Jr. currently qualify as independent directors under applicable Nasdaq and SEC criteria and as Independent Directors under our Bylaws. In making these independence determinations, the Board reviewed and discussed additional information provided by the Directors and the Company with regard to each of the Directors' relationships with the Company and its affiliates and those companies to which the Company or its affiliates provide management or advisory services. The Board has concluded that none of these three Directors possessed or currently possesses any relationship that could impair his or her judgment in connection with his or her duties and responsibilities as a Director or that could otherwise be a direct or indirect material relationship under applicable criteria of the Nasdaq and SEC. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Board Committees    
[END TABLE]
The Board has an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee (including an Equity Plan Committee) and Nominating and Governance Committee. The Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee have each adopted a written charter, which is available on our website, www.rmrgroup.com, by clicking on "Investors & Media" and then clicking on "Corporate Governance." Shareholders may also request copies free of charge by writing to Investor Relations, The RMR Group Inc., Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street, Suite 300, Newton, Massachusetts 02458. 
Our Audit Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Directors under applicable Nasdaq rules who also meet the independence criteria applicable to audit committees under the Sarbanes Oxley Act and the SEC's implementing rules under that law. 
Our Equity Plan Committee is a subcommittee of our Compensation Committee and operates under the charter of our Compensation Committee and The RMR Group Inc. 2016 Omnibus Equity Plan (the "Equity Plan"). Our Equity Plan Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Directors under applicable Nasdaq rules. 
We are a "controlled company" under the rules of the Nasdaq because Adam Portnoy controls more than 50% of our voting power; therefore, our Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee may, and do, include Independent and Managing Directors. The Director of Internal Audit, with the assistance of Company management, proposes the agenda for committee meetings under the oversight and direction of the Committee Chairs. Additionally, the charter of each of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee provides that the committee may form and delegate authority to subcommittees of one or more members when appropriate. Subcommittees are subject to the provisions of the applicable committee's charter. Additional information about the committees is provided below.

The Board oversees risk as part of its general oversight of the Company. Oversight of risk is addressed as part of various Board and Board committee activities and through regular and special Board and Board committee meetings. The actual day to day business of the Company is conducted by management, and management is responsible to incorporate risk management in its activities. The Company's Director of Internal Audit provides the Company advice and assistance with the Company's risk management function. 
In discharging their oversight responsibilities, the Board and Board committees review regularly a wide range of reports provided to them by management, internal audit and service providers, including:
The Board and Board committees discuss these matters among themselves and with management of the Company, the Director of Internal Audit, counsel and the Company's independent auditors. 
The Audit Committee takes a leading role in helping the Board fulfill its responsibilities for oversight of the Company's financial reporting, internal audit function, risk management and the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee meets at least quarterly and reports its findings to the Board. The Board and Audit Committee review periodic reports from the Company's independent auditors regarding potential risks, including risks related to the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviews annually, approves and oversees an internal audit plan developed by the Company's Director of Internal Audit with the goal of helping the Company systematically evaluate the effectiveness of its risk management, control and governance processes. The Audit Committee considers risks relating to cybersecurity and, for that purpose, receives regular reports 
THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement    29 
from management regarding cybersecurity risks and countermeasures being undertaken or considered by the Company, including updates on the internal and external cybersecurity landscape and relevant technical developments. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the Company's Director of Internal Audit to review the results of the Company's internal audits, and directs or recommends to the Board actions or changes it determines appropriate to enhance or improve the effectiveness of the Company's risk management. The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of the Company's Director of Internal Audit. 
It is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Company or to develop processes and controls to eliminate all risks and their possible effects, and processes and controls employed to address risks may be limited in their effectiveness. Moreover, it is necessary for the Company to bear certain risks to achieve its objectives. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, the Company's ability to manage risk is subject to substantial limitations. 
To learn more about the risks facing the Company, you can review the matters discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and "Warning Concerning Forward Looking Statements" in our Annual Report. The risks described in the Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that may currently be deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.

management agreements with RMR LLC. This table presents the management services and reimbursable payroll and related cost revenues from SIR separately as they relate to periods prior to the merger with OPI.  
   Our Management Agreements with the Managed Equity REITs  
RMR LLC is party to a business management agreement and a property management agreement with each Managed Equity REIT. Each business management agreement requires RMR LLC to use its reasonable best efforts to present the Managed Equity REIT with a continuing and suitable real estate investment program consistent with the REIT's real estate investment policies and objectives. Each property management agreement requires RMR LLC to act as managing agent for each Managed Equity REIT's properties and devote such time, attention and effort as may be appropriate to operate and manage the Managed Equity REIT's properties in a diligent, orderly and efficient manner. 
Business Management Fees and Expense Reimbursement.  Each business management agreement between RMR LLC and a Managed Equity REIT provides for (i) an annual base management fee, payable monthly, and (ii) an annual incentive business management fee. The annual base management fee generally is calculated as the lesser of:
The base management fee is payable monthly in arrears. 
The annual incentive business management fee payable by each Managed Equity REIT, if any, is calculated as follows:
 36    THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement the SNL U.S. Office REIT Index for periods beginning on and after January 1, 2019; and for SNH, the SNL U.S. REIT Healthcare Index. 
If the business management agreement is terminated, the base business management fee and incentive business management fee due in respect of any partial period prior to the date of termination will be prorated as provided in the agreement. 
Under each business management agreement, the Managed Equity REIT pays or reimburses RMR LLC for all of the expenses relating to the Managed Equity REIT's activities and RMR LLC bears its general and administrative expenses relating to its performance of its obligations under the agreement, including expenses of its personnel, rent and other office expenses, unless otherwise agreed. Also, the allocable cost of internal audit services is reimbursed by each Managed Equity REIT to RMR LLC; for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Managed Equity REITs cumulatively reimbursed RMR LLC approximately $1.1 million for such services. These amounts are included in the amounts we report as management services revenue. 
Property Management Fees and Expense Reimbursement.  No property management fees are payable by a Managed Equity REIT to RMR LLC for any hotels, senior living communities or travel centers which are leased to, or managed by, a Managed Operator or another operating business such as a hotel management company or a senior living or healthcare services provider. For other properties, each property management agreement between RMR LLC and a Managed Equity REIT provides for (1) a management fee equal to 3.0% of the gross rents collected from tenants and (2) a construction supervision fee equal to 5.0% of the cost of any construction, renovation or repair activities at the 
THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement    37 
Managed Equity REIT's properties, other than ordinary maintenance and repairs. Also, under each property management agreement, the Managed Equity REIT pays certain allocable expenses of RMR LLC in the performance of its duties, including wages for onsite property management personnel and allocated costs of centralized property management services. 
Term and Termination.  The terms of the business and property management agreements with each Managed Equity REIT end on December 31, 2038, and automatically extend on December 31st of each year so that the terms thereafter end on the 20th anniversary of the date of the extension. A Managed Equity REIT has the right to terminate its management agreements with RMR LLC: (1) at any time upon 60 days' written notice for convenience, (2) immediately upon written notice for cause, as defined in the agreements, (3) on written notice given within 60 days after the end of any calendar year for a performance reason, as defined in the agreements, and (4) by written notice during the 12 months following a manager change of control, as defined in the agreements. RMR LLC has the right to terminate the management agreements for good reason, as defined in the agreements. 
If a Managed Equity REIT terminates a management agreement for convenience, or if RMR LLC terminates a management agreement with a Managed Equity REIT for good reason, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC a termination fee equal to the sum of the present values of the monthly future fees, as defined in the agreement, payable for the remaining term of the agreement, assuming it had not been terminated. If a Managed Equity REIT terminates a management agreement for a performance reason, as defined in the agreement, the Managed Equity REIT is obligated to pay RMR LLC the termination fee calculated as described above, but assuming a remaining term of ten years. A Managed Equity REIT is not required to pay any termination fee if it terminates its business or property management agreements for cause, or as a result of a manager change of control, in each case as defined in such agreements. The management agreements provide for certain proportional adjustments to the termination fees in certain circumstances. 
Other Provisions.  Under both the business and property management agreements, each Managed Equity REIT has agreed to indemnify RMR LLC, its members, officers, employees and affiliates against liabilities relating to acts or omissions of RMR LLC with respect to the provision of services by RMR LLC, except to the extent such provision was in bad faith or fraudulent, was willful misconduct or was grossly negligent. In addition, each management agreement provides that any disputes, as defined in those agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a party to the dispute, will be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement. 
Termination of SIR Management Agreements and Waiver of Termination Fees in Connection with GOV-SIR Merger.  On December 31, 2018, SIR merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of OPI (then GOV) (the "SIR/GOV Merger") and the surviving entity in that merger merged with and into OPI, with OPI as the surviving entity. OPI continues to be managed by RMR LLC pursuant to its business and property management agreements with RMR LLC. Contemporaneously with the execution of the merger agreement for this transaction, on September 14, 2018, SIR and RMR LLC entered into a letter agreement, pursuant to which, effective upon consummation of the SIR/GOV Merger, SIR terminated its business and property management agreements with RMR LLC for convenience, and RMR LLC waived its right to receive payment of the termination fee that would otherwise be due pursuant to each such agreement upon such termination. 
   Our Management Agreement with TRMT  
Tremont Advisors is party to a management agreement with TRMT, pursuant to which Tremont Advisors will implement TRMT's business strategies subject to the oversight of TRMT's board of trustees and is responsible for TRMT's day to day operations and to perform (or cause to be performed) corporate office functions for TRMT. In June 2018, Tremont Advisors agreed to waive any business management fees otherwise due and payable by TRMT pursuant to the management agreement for the period beginning July 1, 2018 until June 30, 2020. In addition, no incentive fee will be paid or payable by TRMT to Tremont Advisors for the 2018 or 2019 calendar years. 
 38    THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement 
Fees and Expense Reimbursements.  Under the management agreement, TRMT is responsible to pay Tremont Advisors the following: 
For purposes of the calculation of base management fees and incentive fees payable to Tremont Advisors, "core earnings" is defined as net income (or loss) attributable to common shareholders of TRMT, computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"), including realized losses not otherwise included in GAAP net income (loss), and excluding: (a) the incentive fees earned by Tremont Advisors; (b) depreciation and amortization (if any); (c) non-cash equity compensation expense (if any); (d) unrealized gains, losses and other similar non-cash items that are included in net income for the period of the calculation (regardless of whether such items are included in or deducted from net income or in other comprehensive income or loss under GAAP); and (e) one time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain material non-cash income or expense items, in each case after discussions between Tremont Advisors and the independent trustees of TRMT and approved by a majority of such independent trustees. Pursuant to the terms of the management agreement, the exclusion of depreciation and amortization from the calculation of core earnings shall only apply to owned real estate. Shares of beneficial interest of TRMT that are entitled to a specific periodic distribution or have other debt characteristics will not be included in equity for the purpose of calculating incentive fees payable to Tremont Advisors. Instead, the aggregate distribution amount that accrues to such shares during the calendar quarter of such calculation will be subtracted from core earnings for purposes of calculating incentive fees, unless such distribution is otherwise already excluded from core earnings. Equity and core earnings as defined in the management agreement are non-GAAP financial measures and may be different than shareholders' equity and net income of TRMT calculated according to GAAP. 
THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement    39 
Advisors a termination fee equal to (a) three times the sum of (i) the average annual base management fee and (ii) the average annual incentive fee, in each case paid or payable to Tremont Advisors during the 24 month period immediately preceding the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the date of termination or, if such termination occurs within 24 months of its initial commencement, the base management fee and the incentive fee will be annualized for such two year period based on such fees earned by Tremont Advisors during such period, plus (b) an amount equal to the initial organizational costs related to TRMT's formation and the costs of the TRMT IPO and the concurrent private placement paid by Tremont Advisors. No termination fee will be payable if the management agreement is terminated by TRMT for a cause event or by Tremont Advisors without TRMT's material breach.  
Term and Termination.  The initial term of the management agreement with TRMT ends on December 31, 2020, and the agreement will automatically renew for successive one year terms beginning January 1, 2021 and each January 1 thereafter, unless it is sooner terminated upon written notice delivered no later than 180 days prior to a renewal date by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the independent trustees of TRMT based upon a determination that (a) Tremont Advisors' performance is unsatisfactory and materially detrimental to TRMT or (b) the base management fee and incentive fee, taken as a whole, payable to Tremont Advisors under the management agreement are not fair to TRMT (provided that in the instance of (b), Tremont Advisors will be afforded the opportunity to renegotiate the base management fee and incentive fee prior to termination).

Other Provisions.  TRMT has agreed to indemnify Tremont Advisors and its affiliates, including RMR LLC, its members, officers, employees and affiliates against liabilities relating to acts or omissions of such party with respect to the provision of services to TRMT, except to the extent such provision was in bad faith or was grossly negligent. In addition, the management agreement provides that any disputes, as defined in the agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a party to the dispute, shall be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement. 
   Our Management Agreements with the Managed Operators  
Fees.  RMR LLC provides services and earns fees pursuant to a business management agreement with each of the Managed Operators. Under these agreements, RMR LLC provides services to the Managed Operators relating to, or assists them with, among other things, their compliance with various laws and rules applicable to them, capital markets and financing activities, maintenance of their properties, selection of new business sites and evaluation of other business opportunities, accounting and financial reporting, internal audit, investor relations and general oversight of the company's daily business activities, including legal and tax matters, human resources, insurance programs and management information systems. 
Each Managed Operator pays RMR LLC a fee under its business management agreement in an amount equal to 0.6% of: (i) for FVE, FVE's revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP other than revenues reportable by FVE with respect to properties for which FVE provides management services, plus the gross revenues of properties managed by FVE determined in accordance with GAAP; (ii) for Sonesta, Sonesta's revenues from all sources reportable under GAAP, other than any revenues reportable by Sonesta with respect to hotels for which Sonesta provides management services, plus the revenues of hotels managed by Sonesta (except to the extent such managed hotel revenues are included in Sonesta's gross revenues under GAAP); and (iii) for TA, the sum of TA's gross fuel margin, determined as TA's fuel sales revenues less its cost of fuel sales, plus TA's total nonfuel revenues. In addition, the business management agreement with each Managed Operator provides that the compensation of senior executives of the Managed Operator, who are also employees or officers of RMR LLC, is the responsibility of the party to or on behalf of which the individual renders services. In the past, because at least 80.0% of each of these executives' business time was devoted to services to the Managed Operator, 80.0% of these executives' total cash compensation was paid by the Managed Operator and the remainder was paid by RMR LLC. Also, the allocable cost of internal audit services is reimbursed by each Managed Operator to RMR LLC; for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Managed Operators cumulatively reimbursed RMR LLC approximately $484 thousand for such services. We record these reimbursed internal costs as management services revenue. 
Term and Termination.  The terms of the business management agreements with each Managed Operator end on December 31, 2019, and automatically extend for successive one year terms, unless RMR LLC or the applicable Managed Operator gives notice of non-renewal before the expiration of the applicable term. Also, a Managed Operator may terminate its business management agreement at any time (i) for FVE and TA, on 60 days' notice and RMR LLC may terminate such agreements at any time on 120 days' notice and (ii) for Sonesta, on 30 days' notice and RMR LLC may terminate its agreement with Sonesta on 30 days' notice. If FVE or TA terminates or elects not to renew its agreement, other than for cause as defined in each agreement, the Managed Operator is obligated to pay RMR LLC a termination fee equal to 2.875 times the sum of the annual base management fee and the annual internal audit services expense, which amounts are based on averages during the 24 consecutive calendar months prior to the date of notice of nonrenewal or termination. 
Other Provisions.  Each Managed Operator has agreed to indemnify RMR LLC, its members, officers, employees and affiliates against liabilities relating to acts or omissions of RMR LLC with respect to the provision of services by RMR LLC, except to the extent such provision was in bad faith or was grossly negligent. In addition, each agreement provides that any disputes, as defined in those agreements, arising out of or relating to the agreement or the provision of services pursuant thereto, upon the demand of a party to the dispute, shall be subject to mandatory arbitration in accordance with procedures provided in the agreement.

   Share Awards by Our Public Client Companies  
Our public client companies annually award equity grants to certain of our Directors, officers and employees. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the compensation committees of the Managed REITs and the public Managed Operators awarded common shares directly to such persons in connection with their service as directors, trustees or officers of, or the provision of services to, those companies. Based on their grant date values, the aggregate value of such awards was as follows: $1,289,535 from GOV; $3,311,900 from HPT; $1,687,452 from ILPT; $1,543,405 from SIR; $2,317,218 from SNH; $139,200 from FVE; $304,861 from TA; and $1,191,880 from TRMT. On occasion, our public client companies have entered into arrangements with former employees of RMR LLC in connection with the termination of their employment with RMR LLC, providing for the acceleration of vesting of common shares previously awarded to them under the respective companies' equity compensation plan.

   The Up-C Transaction  
The transaction by which, among other things, OPI (then known as GOV), HPT, SIR (now part of OPI) and SNH, the four then existing Managed Equity REITs, acquired 15,000,000 Class A Common Shares (the "Up-C Transaction") from us was completed on June 5, 2015 pursuant to transaction agreements, we, RMR LLC and ABP Trust entered with each of such Managed Equity REIT. In addition to the amended and restated business management agreement and amended and restated property management agreement RMR LLC entered with each such Managed Equity REIT, the Company is party to the agreements described below which were entered into on June 5, 2015 in connection with the Up-C Transaction: 
As of September 30, 2018, we had recorded a liability of approximately $34.3 million payable to ABP Trust under the tax receivable agreement, which relates to our purchase of 15,000,000 class A membership units of RMR LLC in the Up-C Transaction. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we paid approximately $2.3 million to ABP Trust pursuant to the tax receivable agreement. Future redemptions of ABP Trust's class A membership units of RMR LLC, if and when they occur, are expected to give rise to increases in the tax basis of the assets of RMR LLC attributable to our interests in RMR LLC. Such increases in tax basis are likely to increase (for tax purposes) amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of income tax we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. These increases in tax basis may also decrease gain (or increase loss) on future dispositions of certain assets to the extent the increased tax basis is allocated to those assets. As a result, any such future redemptions are expected to increase the amounts payable to ABP Trust under the tax receivable agreement.

   Agreements with RMR Office Property Fund LP  
On August 31, 2018, ABP Trust, which is controlled by Adam Portnoy, formed the Open End Fund. A subsidiary of ABP Trust is the general partner of the Open End Fund. In connection with the formation of the Open End Fund, ABP Trust contributed 15 properties to the Open End Fund with an aggregate value of $206.3 million in exchange for 206,300 limited partnership units in the Open End Fund and RMR LLC committed to contribute up to $100.0 million to the Open End Fund when called by the general partner in exchange for 100,000 limited partnership units in the Open End Fund. The valuation of the 15 properties contributed to the Open End Fund by ABP Trust was agreed to by a special committee of our Board consisting of members that were unaffiliated with ABP Trust and with the assistance of an independent third-party appraiser. This same special committee also approved RMR LLC's $100.0 million capital commitment to the Open End Fund. RMR LLC provides management and administrative services to the Open End Fund pursuant to management agreements. Pursuant to those agreements, in return for providing these services, RMR LLC receives annual fees equal to 1.0% of the Open End Fund's net asset value, fees equal to 3.0% of all rents collected from commercial real estate investments and 5.0% of costs of construction or any improvement at commercial real estate investments held by the Open End Fund. The terms of these management agreements continue until the earlier of (i) the date on which the Open End Fund is liquidated and (ii) the date that the current general partner of the Open End Fund is removed from that position. 
   Leases  
As of September 30, 2018, RMR LLC leased office space for use as its headquarters and other offices under various lease agreements with ABP Trust and certain Managed Equity REITs. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, RMR LLC incurred rental expense under these leases aggregating $4.8 million. Generally, the rents RMR LLC pays the Managed Equity REITs were set at the average building rent for third party tenants in the same buildings at the time the leases were entered and the leases were approved by the independent trustees of the applicable Managed Equity REIT. The rents RMR LLC pays to ABP Trust were set based upon a survey of comparable market rents at the time the leases were entered. These leases have various termination dates and several have renewal options. Also, some of these leases allow RMR LLC to terminate such lease early if RMR LLC's management agreements applicable to the buildings in which RMR LLC leases space are terminated.

    Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control    
[END TABLE]
From time to time, we and our public client companies have entered into arrangements with our former employees in connection with the termination of their employment with us, providing for the acceleration of vesting of shares previously awarded and, in certain instances, payments for future services to us as a consultant or employee and continuation of health care and other benefits. Although neither we nor such client companies have a formal policy, plan or arrangement for payments to our employees in connection with their termination of employment with us, we and such client companies may in the future provide on a discretionary basis for similar payments depending on various factors we or they then consider relevant and if we or such client company believes it is in its best interests to do so. 
On September 13, 2018, the Equity Plan Committee approved awards of 8,000 Class A Common Shares to Mr. Adam Portnoy and 4,000 Class A Common Shares to each of Ms. Jennifer Clark and Mr. Mark Kleifges in their capacities as our executive officers. These awards were valued at $95.00 per Class A Common Share, the closing price of the Class A Common Shares on the Nasdaq on the date the awards were made under our Equity Plan. The form of award agreement for each of these awards provides for vesting of the Class A Common Shares in five equal annual installments beginning on the date of the award and acceleration of vesting of all share awards upon the occurrence of certain change in control or employment termination events (each, a "Termination Event"). 
The following table describes the potential payments to our named executive officers upon a Termination Event, if such event had occurred, as of September 30, 2018.

   Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Elements    
[END TABLE]
Each of our named executive officers was provided with the following material elements of compensation in fiscal year 2018: 
   Base Salary  
In fiscal year 2018 we paid an annual base salary of $300,000 to each of our named executive officers. For our fiscal year 2019, we will pay an annual base salary of $325,000 to each of our named executive officers. 
 56    THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement 
   Annual Cash Bonuses  
Annual cash bonuses are a key component of our named executive officer compensation and represented the majority of compensation we paid to each of our named executive officers for our 2018 fiscal year. We did not provide guaranteed cash bonuses to any of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2018 and did not set specific performance targets on which bonuses would be payable. Instead, the annual cash bonuses we paid to our named executive officers with respect to fiscal year 2018 were discretionary in amount and were based on a performance evaluation conducted by, in the case of Adam Portnoy and Barry Portnoy, the Equity Plan Committee, and in the case of other named executive officers, our Compensation Committee. The evaluation involved an analysis of both (i) our overall performance and (ii) the performance of the individual officer and his or her contributions to us. We believe this evaluation process allowed us to link pay with performance in the closest way possible and provided us with the flexibility necessary to take all relevant factors into account in determining the bonus amounts, including our named executive officers' ability to react to changing circumstances that impact our business. We believe our compensation process provided us with a better compensation structure than a formulaic bonus structure based solely on the achievement of specific pre-established performance targets which may not capture all appropriate factors that materially impacted our or the individual named executive officer's performance. 
   Equity Awards  
Under the Equity Plan, an aggregate of 600,000 Class A Common Shares are available for grants of options to acquire stock, restricted or unrestricted stock, contractual rights to receive stock in the future, stock appreciation rights, other rights to receive compensation in amounts determined by the value of the Class A Common Shares and cash based awards. Employees, Directors, independent contractors and consultants of the Company or any affiliate of the Company are eligible to receive awards under the Equity Plan. Equity awards we make to our employees (including our named executive officers) are made by our Equity Plan Committee. Equity awards made to our employees (including our named executive officers) by our public client companies are made to them by the compensation committees of the boards of such companies. 
   401(k) Plans  
We maintain a 401(k) plan for eligible employees, including our named executive officers and provide matching contributions equal to 100.0% of the first 3.0% and 50.0% of the next 2.0% of an employee's cash compensation contributed to the plan up to stated maximums. We do not maintain a defined pension plan or any nonqualified deferred compensation plans. 
   Employee Benefits  
Eligible employees, including our named executive officers, participate in broad based and comprehensive employee benefit programs, including medical, dental, vision, life and disability insurance. Our named executive officers participate in these programs on the same basis as other eligible employees. 
   Employment Agreements  
We have no employment agreements with our named executive officers or any of our other employees.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
In the course of the Audit Committee's oversight of the Company's financial reporting process, the Audit Committee has: (i) reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018; (ii) discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent auditors, the matters required to be discussed under PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301; (iii) received the written disclosures and the letter from the auditors required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; (iv) discussed with the independent auditors their independence; and (v) considered whether the provision of non-audit services by the independent auditors is compatible with maintaining their independence and concluded that it is compatible at this time. 
Based on the foregoing review and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

RATIFICATION OF THE  APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP  AS INDEPENDENT AUDITORS (ITEM 2) 
The Audit Committee has the sole authority and responsibility to hire, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace our independent auditors and is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and general oversight of the work of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee is responsible for approving the audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors and the associated fees. 
The Audit Committee evaluates the performance of our independent auditors annually and determines whether to reengage the current independent auditors or consider other audit firms. In doing so, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the auditors, the auditors' technical expertise and knowledge of our operations and industry, the auditors' independence, legal proceedings involving the auditors, the results of PCAOB inspections and peer quality reviews of the auditors and the auditors' reputation in the marketplace. In connection with the mandated rotation of the independent auditors' lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chair consider the selection of the new lead engagement partner identified by the independent auditors. 
Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Ernst & Young LLP has served as the Company's independent auditors since our formation in 2015 and is considered by management and the Audit Committee to be well qualified. Further, the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Audit Committee has determined to submit its selection of the independent auditors to the Company's shareholders for ratification. This vote will ratify prior action by the Audit Committee and will not be binding upon the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may reconsider its prior appointment of the independent auditors or consider the results of this vote when it determines to appoint our independent auditors in the future.

   Audit Fees and All Other Fees    
[END TABLE]
The following table shows the fees for audit and other services provided to us by Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         Audit Fees                   $ 798,500                  $ 994,000

[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. This category includes fees associated with the annual financial statements audit and related audit procedures, work performed in connection with any registration statements and any applicable Current Reports on Form 8-K and the review of any of the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
Audit Related Fees. This category consists of services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of financial statements and are not included in "Audit Fees." These services principally include due diligence in connection with acquisitions, consultation on accounting and internal control 
THE RMR GROUP INC.    2019 Proxy Statement    59 
matters, audits in connection with proposed or consummated acquisitions, information systems audits and other attest services. The decrease in audit related fees from 2017 to 2018 reflects additional audit fees in 2017 in connection with the initial public offering of TRMT that was completed in January 2018 and the RIF rights offering that was completed in September 2017 and which fees were paid by Tremont Advisors and RMR Advisors, respectively. 
Tax Fees. This category consists of fees for tax services, including tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. 
All Other Fees. This category consists of services that are not included in the above categories. The amounts for 2018 and 2017 reflect annual subscription fees for Ernst & Young LLP's online accounting research application. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors    
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures that are intended to control the services provided by our independent auditors and to monitor their continuing independence. Under these policies, no services may be undertaken by our independent auditors unless the engagement is specifically approved by the Audit Committee or the services are included within a category that has been approved by the Audit Committee. The maximum charge for services is established by the Audit Committee when the specific engagement or the category of services is approved. In certain circumstances, our management is required to notify the Audit Committee when approved services are undertaken and the Audit Committee or its Chair may approve amendments or modifications to the engagement or the maximum fees. Our Director of Internal Audit is responsible for reporting to the Audit Committee regarding compliance with these policies and procedures. 
The Audit Committee will not approve engagements of the independent auditors to perform non-audit services for the Company if doing so will cause the independent auditors to cease to be independent within the meaning of applicable SEC or Nasdaq rules. In other circumstances, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, whether our independent auditors are able to provide the required services in a more or less effective and efficient manner than other available service providers and whether the services are consistent with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rules. 
All services for which the Company engaged its independent auditors in fiscal 2018 and 2017 were approved by the Audit Committee. The total fees for audit and non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 are set forth above. The Audit Committee approved the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP to provide these non-audit services because it determined that Ernst & Young LLP providing these services would not compromise Ernst & Young LLP's independence and that the firm's familiarity with our record keeping and accounting systems would permit the firm to provide these services with equal or higher quality, more efficiently and at a lower cost than the Company could obtain these services from other providers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Other Information    
[END TABLE]
The Company has been advised by Ernst & Young LLP that neither that firm, nor any member of the firm, has any material interest, direct or indirect, in any capacity in the Company or its subsidiaries. 
One or more representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If shareholders fail to approve the proposal, the Board may reconsider its prior appointment of the independent auditors or consider the results of this vote when it determines to appoint our independent auditors in the future. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as independent auditors.
