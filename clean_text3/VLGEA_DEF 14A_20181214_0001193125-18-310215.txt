PROXY STATEMENT 
December 14, 2018 
Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
This Proxy Statement and the accompanying form of proxy are being furnished to shareholders of Village Super Market, Inc. (the "Company") in connection with the solicitation by and on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at the offices of the Company, 733 Mountain Avenue, Springfield, New Jersey on December 14, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. and at all postponements or adjournments thereof. You may obtain directions to the Company's corporate headquarters by contacting investor relations by telephone at (973) 467-2200 extension 218 or by e-mail at john.vanorden@wakefern.com. This Proxy Statement was mailed and/or made available to shareholders on or about October 29, 2018. 
At the close of business on October 12, 2018, the Company had outstanding and entitled to vote 10,078,896 shares of Class A common stock, no par value ("Class A Stock"), and 4,303,748 shares of Class B common stock, no par value ("Class B Stock"). The holders of the outstanding shares of Class A Stock are entitled to one vote per share and the holders of Class B Stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Shareholders of record at the close of business on October 12, 2018 are entitled to vote at this meeting. 
All shares of Common Stock represented by properly executed proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting, unless such proxies previously have been revoked. Unless the proxies indicate otherwise, the shares of Common Stock represented by such proxies will be voted for the election of the Board of Directors' nominees for directors and to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as independent auditors. Management does not know of any other matter to be brought before the Annual Meeting. 
Directors are elected by a plurality of the number of votes cast. With respect to each other matter to be voted upon, a vote of a majority of the number of votes cast is required for approval. Abstentions and proxies submitted by brokers with a "not voted" direction will not be counted as votes cast with respect to each matter. 
Any shareholder who executes and delivers a proxy may revoke it at any time prior to its use by: (a) delivering written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Company at its office; (b) delivering to the Secretary of the Company a duly executed proxy bearing a later date; or (c) appearing at the Meeting and requesting the return of his or her proxy. 
You may own common shares in one or both of the following ways — either directly in your name as the shareholder of record, or indirectly through a broker, bank or other holder of record in "street name." If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are the holder of record of these shares and we are sending these proxy materials directly to you. As the holder of record, you have the right to give your proxy directly to us. If you hold your shares in street name, your broker, bank or other holder of record is sending these proxy materials to you. As a holder in street name, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote by completing the voting instruction form that accompanies your proxy materials. If you hold shares in street name and wish to vote your shares directly, you must contact your broker, bank or other holder of record to obtain the instructions and documentation required. Regardless of how you hold your shares, we invite you to attend the Meeting.

INFORMATION REGARDING THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES 
The Company is a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules of NASDAQ. Therefore the Company is not required to and does not have (1) a majority of independent directors; (2) a nominating committee comprised solely of independent directors to identify and recommend nominees to the Board of Directors; or (3) a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors. The Company qualifies as a controlled company due to the ownership by the Sumas Family Group of shares allowing it to cast more than 50% of the votes eligible to be cast for the election of directors. The Board of Directors has determined that each nonmanagement director is independent as defined by the Rules of the SEC and the listing standards of NASDAQ. 
The Board held four meetings in fiscal 2018. All directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board, and meetings of Board committees on which the director served, during the time such director served on the Board or committee. 
The Executive Committee, which consists of Robert Sumas, William Sumas and John P. Sumas, meets on call and is authorized to act on all matters pertaining to corporate policies and overall Company performance. 
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board reviews its leadership structure in light of the Company's then current needs, governance trends, and other factors. The Board reviews and considers whether the positions of Chairman and CEO should be combined or separated as part of an ongoing review of the effectiveness of the Corporation's governance structure. As a result, the roles of Chairman and CEO have been split from time to time to facilitate leadership transitions, while at other times the roles have been combined. 
James Sumas, the Company's prior Chief Executive Officer, had also served as the Chairman of the Board since 2003. Upon completion of James Sumas' term, effective December 15, 2017, the Board separated governance responsibilities between the Chairman and CEO roles. The Board believes that this structure provides an effective balance between strong Company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight at this time. 
Management is responsible for the day to day management of the risks that the Company faces, while the Board as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. The Board and its committees receive periodic reports from financial, legal and other management members regarding the most significant risks facing the Company. In addition, the Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight role by receiving periodic reports regarding the Company's risk and control environment.  The Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee, which consists of John P. Sumas, Robert Sumas, John J. Sumas, Steven Crystal, David C. Judge and Peter Lavoy, has the primary responsibility for establishing the compensation paid to executive officers of the Company. This includes base salary, bonus awards and supplemental retirement plans. The full Board of Directors reviews and approves restricted share awards and stock option grants. During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee met twice. The Compensation Committee does not utilize a charter. 
The Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is comprised of four directors, Steven Crystal, Peter Lavoy, Stephen Rooney and David C. Judge, each of whom is independent as defined by the listing standards of NASDAQ. The Audit Committee: (1) monitors the integrity of the Company's financial reporting process and systems of internal controls regarding financial, accounting, regulatory and legal compliance; (2) retains and monitors the independence and performance of the Company's independent auditors; (3) provides an avenue of communication among the independent auditors, management and the Board of Directors; and (4) approves in advance the fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm for all services provided. The Audit Committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors, which is attached to this 2018 proxy statement as Appendix A. During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee met nine times. 
The Board of Directors has determined that David C. Judge is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by applicable SEC regulations and that all members of the Audit Committee are able to read and understand financial statements as required by NASDAQ regulations. 
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee is comprised of four independent directors, as defined by the rules of the SEC and the listing standards of NASDAQ, and operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The members of the Committee are Steven Crystal, Peter Lavoy, Stephen Rooney and David C. Judge (Chair). The Committee appoints the Company's independent auditors. 
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and to issue a report thereon. In addition, the independent auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the independent auditors the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 28, 2018, management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of July 28, 2018, and the independent auditor's evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of that date. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The Company's independent auditors also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence), and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors that firm's independence. On the basis of these items, the Audit Committee determined that KPMG LLP is independent.  Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and the independent auditors and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the report of the independent auditors, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 28, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP for the audit of the Company's annual consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 and 2017, and fees billed for other services rendered by KPMG LLP:

NOMINATION OF CANDIDATES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The full Board of Directors acts on all matters concerning the identification, evaluation and nomination of director candidates. The Board does not utilize a charter in performing this function. As a matter of policy, the Board will consider nominations of director candidates submitted by any shareholder upon the submission of the names and biographical data of the candidates (including any relationship to the proposing shareholder) in writing to the Board of Directors at 733 Mountain Avenue, Springfield, New Jersey, 07081. Information regarding director candidates for election to the Board in 2019 must be submitted by July 1, 2019. 
The Board's process for evaluating candidates recommended by any shareholder is the same as for candidates recommended by the Board, management or others.
