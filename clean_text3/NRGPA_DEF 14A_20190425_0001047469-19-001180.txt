   Director Skills, Experience, and Background    
[END TABLE]
As discussed in more detail under "Governance of the Company" beginning on page 7, the Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for assessing with the Board, on an ongoing basis, the appropriate skills, experience, and background that we seek in Board members in the context of our business and the existing composition of the Board. 
This assessment includes numerous factors such as independence; understanding of and experience in the retail and wholesale competitive energy market, customer expertise, finance, and operations; executive leadership; age; and gender and ethnic diversity. The Board also assesses whether a nominee's background, experience, personal characteristics, or skills will advance the Board's goal of creating and sustaining a Board that can support and oversee management's execution of the Company's strategic priorities. 
The Board is continually evaluating the need for board refreshment and has been focused on identifying individuals whose skills and experiences will enable them to make meaningful contributions to the Company in light of the Company's evolving strategy and direction. The Board also aims to strike a balance between the knowledge and understanding of the business that comes from longer-term service on the Board with the ideas and perspectives that can come from adding new members. 
Our Director nominees have a balance of tenure, age and diversity, which provides our Board with a complementary mix of experience and perspective. In addition, nine of our ten Director nominees are independent. 
See "Board Skills and Experience" on page 12 for a table identifying the primary skills and experience of our Directors, as well as "Proposal No. 1 Election of Directors" on pages 18-23 for the biographies of our Director nominees and a description of the specific skills and viewpoints that each Director brings to bear in his or her service to NRG's Board and Committees.

   Corporate Governance Guidelines and Charters    
[END TABLE]
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines (Guidelines) that, along with the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Fourth Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) and the charters of the committees of the Board (Committees), provide the framework for the governance of the Company. The Board's Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing the Guidelines and recommending any proposed changes to the Board for approval. The Guidelines are available on the Governance section of the Company's investor relations website at http://investors.nrg.com, along with the charters of all of the Committees and the Company's Code of Conduct. The Guidelines, the charters of all of the Committees and the Code of Conduct are also available in print to any stockholder upon request. Stockholders who desire to receive such items in print may request them from the Company's Corporate Secretary by writing to NRG Energy, Inc., 804 Carnegie Center, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Director Independence    
[END TABLE]
Under the Guidelines and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards, a majority of the Board must be composed of independent directors. The Board determines the independence of our directors by applying the independence principles and standards established by the NYSE. These provide that a director is independent only if the Board affirmatively determines that such director does not have a direct or indirect material relationship with the Company, which may include commercial, industrial, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable, familial and other business, professional and personal relationships. 
The Board conducts a review of the independence of the Company's directors on an annual basis. In its most recent review, the Board considered, among other things:
In addition, because the Company provides retail electricity services through certain of its subsidiaries, the Board also considered instances where certain of our directors either received electricity services from the Company or serve as directors of businesses that received electricity services from the Company. 
The Board has determined that all of the Company's directors are independent under the Guidelines and the NYSE listing standards, with the exception of Mauricio Gutierrez, our President and Chief Executive Officer. 
Each of the Audit, Compensation, and Governance and Nominating Committees is made up solely of independent directors. In accordance with the Guidelines and NYSE listing standards, all members of the Audit and Compensation Committees meet additional independence standards applicable to audit and compensation committee members, respectively.

All directors stand for election annually. Each director will hold office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until the director's earlier death, resignation or removal. 
As of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, there were 11 members of the Board. During the 2018 fiscal year, no director attended less than 75% of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of the Committees on which he or she served. 
The Guidelines provide that non-executive directors meet in executive session regularly following Board meetings. The Company's Non-Executive Chairman, Mr. Coben, presides at these sessions. Also, pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, Mr. Coben has been designated as an "alternate member" of all Committees to replace any absent or disqualified members of a Committee. 
Directors are encouraged to attend the annual meetings of stockholders. All of the directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Our CEO, Mr. Gutierrez, and Chairman, Mr. Coben, work closely together in complementary roles. Mr. Gutierrez focuses on the day-to-day operations of the Company and establishes the Company's strategic plan. Mr. Coben leads the Board's responsibilities for reviewing, approving and monitoring fundamental financial and business strategies and major corporate actions, assessing major risks facing the Company and management, and overseeing succession planning, most notably at the CEO level, and he presides over the Board and its Committees as they perform their broad and varied oversight functions. The Board believes that these complementary roles provide the appropriate governance structure for the Company at this time. 
Since December 2003, NRG's governance structure has been led by a separate CEO and Chairman of the Board. Irrespective of the Company's current practice, the Board believes that an effective board leadership structure is highly dependent on the experience, skills and personal interaction between persons in leadership roles. As stated in the Guidelines, the Board believes that it is in the best interest of the Company for the Board to make a determination regarding separation of the roles of Chairman and CEO based upon the present circumstances.

The Board has taken a proactive approach in applying leading governance practices, which is evidenced by the Board's recommendation, and our stockholders' subsequent approval, of the majority voting standard for the election of directors at the 2009 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the declassification of our Board at the 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the adoption of proxy access following the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Furthermore, as described in the Guidelines, the Board follows a series of governance practices that it believes foster effective Board oversight and accountability to you, our stockholders. These practices include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Proxy Access    
[END TABLE]
Following our 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders at which a non-binding proxy access stockholder proposal received the affirmative vote of majority of shares present, we engaged with the stockholder who submitted the proposal. Our Board determined that the best course of action for the Company and our stockholders was to amend our Bylaws to include proxy access. In December 2016, our Board adopted amendments to our Bylaws to implement proxy access. Under the proxy access provisions in our Bylaws, a stockholder (or group of up to 20 stockholders) continuously owning at least 3% of our outstanding common stock for a period of at least three years prior to the date of the nomination may nominate and include in our proxy materials for the following annual meeting director nominees constituting up to 20% of the Board. To do so, the stockholder must submit the information required by Article II, Section 15 of our Bylaws to the Company's Corporate Secretary as described further under "Director Nominees for Inclusion in the Proxy Materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Proxy Access)."

   Risk Oversight    
[END TABLE]
The Board performs its risk oversight function in several ways. The Board monitors, reviews and reacts to strategic and corporate risks through reports by management, including the Enterprise Risk Management team, which is further described below, and through the Committees of the Board. Several Committees of the Board have responsibilities for addressing risk, however, the Board primarily conducts this oversight function through the Finance and Risk Management Committee. The Finance and Risk Management Committee is responsible for company-wide enterprise risk management. The Company's Financial Risk Management Committee, a committee comprised of senior management and key personnel in and around the finance, commercial operations and risk functions, reports to the Board's Finance and Risk Management Committee on a regular basis. 
The table below summarizes the significant role the various Board Committees play in carrying out the risk oversight function. 
The Chairs of each of the Committees regularly report to the Board on all matters reviewed by their respective Committees, thereby providing the Board with the opportunity to identify and discuss any risk-related issues or request additional information from management or the Committees that may assist the Board in its risk oversight role. To this end, risk-related issues presented to the Committees are routinely presented to the full Board to ensure proper oversight.

       2018 Stockholder Engagement    
[END TABLE]
Stockholder feedback is important to our Board's decision-making process and has driven recent changes to our governance and compensation practices, including changes to our 2017 compensation program, the adoption of proxy access in 2016, and the disclosure of our political contribution policy. 
In early 2018, we initiated a broad stockholder outreach program to discuss NRG's long-term strategy and sustainability goals, as well as to review and seek feedback on our sustainability, governance, and compensation practices. We reached out to and had discussions with stockholders representing approximately 37% of our shares outstanding. In addition, during 2018, one or more members of management were involved in more than 50 in-person and telephonic meetings with investors representing more than 31% of shares outstanding. Based on the common themes we heard throughout 2018, boardroom discussion and action included the following:

   Board of Director Annual Performance Evaluation Process    
[END TABLE]
The Board conducts its annual performance evaluation using an open-ended question and answer format in a survey generated by the Corporate Secretary on the Board's web portal. All directors are required to assess the actions taken by the Board during the past year and suggest changes or improvements for each Committee and the Board. The questions give each director an anonymous opportunity to provide candid observations and affirmative feedback to their peers and management. The Governance and Nominating Committee oversees the evaluation process. 
Responses from all directors are combined to create an anonymous summary. The summary is used to promote open dialogue during the executive sessions of the February Board and Committee meetings. One-on-one director meetings are also conducted by the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee to discuss the results. 
The Board believes this process evokes meaningful feedback. The process highlights the Board's commitment to continuous self-improvement by identifying those issues that sometimes require honest and difficult conversations and supports the Board's nomination and refreshment practices. 
Following the 2018 annual director evaluation process, the Board continued its refreshment process with the retirement of three directors and the addition of two new directors that allowed the Board to strength its customer-focus expertise.

       Director Nominee Selection Process    
[END TABLE]
The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying individuals that the Committee believes are qualified to become Board members in accordance with criteria set forth in the Guidelines. These criteria include an individual's business experience and skills, independence, judgment, integrity, and ability to commit sufficient time and attention to the activities of the Board. The Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all Board members. The Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board consider the Company's strategy and the particular skills, experiences and other qualifications that should be represented on the Board as a whole in light of the Company's strategic direction. Listed below are summaries of specific qualifications that the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board believe should be represented on the Board among other qualifications that a Director may bring. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee's process for identifying and evaluating director nominees includes consultation with all directors, solicitation of proposed nominees from all directors, the engagement of one or more professional search firms, if deemed appropriate, interviews with prospective nominees by the Committee (and other directors, if deemed appropriate) and recommendations regarding qualified candidates to the full Board. 
As further described under "Stockholder Recommendations for Director Candidates" on page 68, the Governance and Nominating Committee also considers director candidates recommended by stockholders.

   Board Skills and Experience    
[END TABLE]
Our Directors represent a diverse mix of skills, experiences and viewpoints that are relevant to our Company and facilitate effective oversight. To illustrate the complementary nature each Director's skills and experience, the table below only identifies five primary skills and experiences that each Director brings to the Board. It does not include all of the skills, experiences, qualifications, and diversity that each Director offers, and the fact that a particular experience, skill, or qualification is not listed does not mean that a Director does not possess that skills. We believe identifying five primary skills and experiences is a more meaningful presentation of the complementary contributions and value that each Director brings to their service on the Board and to the Company's stockholders. See "Proposal No. 1 Election of Directors" for the biographies of our Director nominees and a description of the skills and viewpoints that each Director brings to bear in his or her service to NRG's Board and Committees.

Diversity also goes beyond race and gender, and includes diversity of viewpoints and tenure. The differences in experience and expertise allow the Board to hear various perspectives from its members, leading to better outcomes and a robust decision making process.

NRG has a broad sustainability strategy aimed at embedding sustainability into the culture and fabric of the organization and ensuring that sustainability becomes a core function that touches all aspects of our business.

During 2018, the Compensation Committee and Board made certain adjustments to director compensation in order to remain market competitive in consultation with Pay Governance. Total compensation for non-employee directors was increased to $267,000 from $225,000 and the Chairperson retainer was increased to $200,000 from $160,000. Committee Chair retainers remain unchanged. The total annual compensation received by our directors for their service as Board members and Chairs of the Committees of the Board, if applicable, is described in the chart below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    COMPENSATION ELEMENT           COMPENSATION AMOUNT ($) 
 Annual Cash Retainer   100,000  
 Annual Equity Retainer   167,000  
 Annual Chairperson Retainer   200,000  
 Audit Committee Chair Retainer   35,000  
 Other Committee Chair Retainer   20,000  
 Employee Directors   No fees  
[END TABLE]
A non-employee director who is newly appointed to the Board, other than in connection with an annual meeting of stockholders, will receive the Annual Equity Retainer and a pro rata portion of the Annual Retainer upon appointment. 
With respect to Chairperson and Committee Chair Retainers, fifty percent (50%) is received in the form of cash and fifty percent (50%) is received in the form of Deferred Stock Units (DSUs). Directors may however elect to receive the cash portion of their annual compensation as DSUs. Each DSU is equivalent in value to one share of NRG's common stock and represents the right to receive one such share of common stock payable at the time elected by the director or immediately if no such election is made, or in the event the director does not make an election with respect to payment in a particular year, in accordance with his or her prior deferral election. In the event that a director's service with the Company is terminated for any reason, other than cause, DSU awards are payable in accordance with such director's deferral election. If a director's service with the Company is terminated for cause, the award is forfeited. In connection with the grants of the DSUs, each non-employee director also receives dividend equivalent rights (DERs) which become exercisable proportionately with the DSUs to which they relate. Similar to its competitive assessment on behalf of the named executive officer compensation, Pay Governance performed a review of director compensation. Results of the review were shared with the Compensation Committee who made a recommendation to the full Board for final approval.

   Director Stock Ownership Guidelines    
[END TABLE]
Directors are required to retain all stock received as compensation for the duration of their service on the Board, although they may sell shares as necessary to cover tax liability associated with the conversion of DSUs to common stock. Exceptions to these requirements may be made by the Board under special circumstances. No exceptions to such requirements were made for 2018.

Under Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the stockholders of the Company are entitled to vote at this year's Annual Meeting to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K (Regulation S-K) of the rules and regulations under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act). Currently, this vote is conducted every year. The next vote will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
As described more fully in the CD&A beginning on page 38, the Company's executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain and reward top executive talent. The intent of the Company's compensation program is to reward the achievement of the Company's annual goals and objectives while supporting the Company's long-term business strategy. 
This proposal, commonly known as a "say on pay" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the Company's named executive officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
The say on pay vote is advisory and therefore not binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of the stockholders and to the extent there is a significant number of votes against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, stockholders' concerns will be considered and the Board and the Compensation Committee will evaluate actions necessary to address those concerns. 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the Company's executive compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Proxies received by the Board will be voted "FOR" the approval of the Company's named executive officer compensation unless a contrary vote is specified.

The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements. To execute this responsibility, the Audit Committee engages in a thorough annual evaluation of (i) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence, (ii) whether the independent registered public accounting firm should be rotated, and (iii) the advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee appointed the firm of KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the 2019 fiscal year at a meeting held in February. KPMG LLP has been retained as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since May 2004. In accordance with SEC rules and KPMG LLP policies, audit partners are subject to rotation requirements to limit the number of consecutive years an individual partner may provide audit services to the Company. For lead and concurring review audit partners, the maximum number of consecutive years of service in that capacity is five years. The Audit Committee is involved in the selection of KPMG LLP's lead audit partner. 
The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of KPMG LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Proxies received by the Board will be voted "FOR" ratification unless a contrary vote is specified.

The Company is not responsible for the content of this stockholder proposal or supporting statement.
The following proposal and supporting statement were submitted by the Comptroller of the City of New York, Scott M. Stringer, on behalf of the New York City Employees' Retirement System, Municipal Building, One Centre Street, Eighth Floor North, New York, New York 10007, which is the beneficial owner of 230,432 shares of the Company's common stock, and which intends to hold such shares of the Company's common stock through the date of the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Proposal    
[END TABLE]
Resolved: The shareholders of NRG Energy, Inc. ("NRG Energy") hereby request that the Company prepare and periodically update a report, to be presented to the pertinent board of directors committee and posted on the Company's website that discloses monetary and non-monetary expenditures that NRG Energy makes on political activities, including:
The report shall identify all recipients and the amount paid to each recipient from Company funds. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Stockholder Supporting Statement    
[END TABLE]
As long-term shareholders, we support transparency and accountability in corporate spending on political activities. 
NRG Energy's current political contribution policy requires "complete and accurate disclosures" only "where required" (http://investors.nrg.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=121544&p=irol-govHighlights, viewed October 26, 2018). The Company therefore does not currently disclose potentially significant contributions that may be channeled anonymously into the political process through trade associations and non-profit groups that need not disclose contributions. Such payments may far surpass the contributions that must be publicly reported. 
Disclosure is consistent with public policy and in the best interest of NRG Energy shareholders. The Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision—which liberalized rules for corporate participation in election-related activities—recognized the importance of disclosure to shareholders, saying: "[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way." 
In our view, in the absence of a system of transparency and accountability, company assets could be used for policy objectives that may be inimical to the long-term interests of, and may pose risks to, shareholders. 
NRG Energy currently lags many energy companies that publicly disclose political spending, including AES Corporation, American Electric Power, Dominion Energy, Edison International, Entergy, Exelon, and Southern Company. 
Given the vagaries of the political process and the uncertainty that political spending will produce any return for shareholders, we believe that companies should be fully transparent by disclosing corporate assets spent in this area. 
We urge shareholders to vote FOR this resolution.

   Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition    
[END TABLE]
The Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" this stockholder proposal for the following reasons: 
This is the fourth consecutive year we have received this proposal from the Comptroller of the City of New York. At our 2016, 2017 and 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company's stockholders rejected this proposal with 58.4%, 69.7% and 65.4%, respectively, of votes cast voting against the proposal. The Board believes that this result indicates that our stockholders agreed that the report requested by this proposal (i) is unnecessary due to our system of reporting of political expenditures, (ii) could hinder the Company's ability to pursue its business and strategic objectives, and (iii) would be an unproductive use of time. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ​   ​   ​  
 ​  |       ​  ​       Proposal  No. 4  Stockholder  Proposal  Regarding  Disclosure  of  Political  Expenditures  ​    ​        29 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
The Board of Directors believes the report requested by this proposal is unnecessary because a system of reporting and accountability for political expenditures already exists and the Company publicly discloses its participation in the political process in support of its business interests, as required by law. The Company is committed to complying and does comply with all applicable laws concerning political expenditures, disclosure, and reporting. 
Current law limits the amounts of political expenditures that are permissible (other than to trade associations or organizations formed under Section 501(c)(4) of the Code), restricts the organizations or entities that can receive corporate funding, and establishes a clear accountability system enforced by regulatory agencies in the U.S. In most jurisdictions, campaign finance information for corporate contributions (other than to trade associations or organizations formed under Section 501(c)(4) of the Code) is now easily accessible to the public through the Internet. The Company also contributes to certain trade associations or organizations formed under Section 501(c)(4) of the Code as further discussed below. 
The Company has disclosed in its Political Contribution Policy (Policy) the mechanisms and means which govern participation in public policy processes (including political expenditures criteria, management and Board oversight mechanisms). Stockholders and interested parties can access the Policy under the heading "Governance" under the "Investors" Section of our website at  www.nrg.com. The Company also requires all of its employees to annually review its policies and procedures pertaining to political contributions in the Company's Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct is also available to the public under the heading "Governance" on our website at www.nrg.com. 
 Political Action Committee Contributions—As set forth in more detail in the Company's Political Contribution Policy, contributions made by the NRG Energy, Inc. Political Action Committee (NRG PAC) are funded entirely by the voluntary contributions of our employees and no corporate funds are used. Contributions of funds from the NRG PAC are made in accordance with the NRG PAC budget as approved by the NRG PAC board. The NRG PAC maintains its own board of directors comprised of employee representatives from across the Company. The NRG PAC board votes on an annual budget for political expenditures and such expenditures are monitored by the NRG PAC treasurer. The NRG PAC files monthly reports of receipts and disbursements with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), as well as pre-election and post-election reports. These publicly available reports identify the names of candidates supported and amounts contributed by the NRG PAC. In addition, all political contributions to federal candidates over $200 are publicly disclosed by the FEC. 
 Corporate Contributions—Contributions of funds from any of the Company's state political action committee and all other Company contributions may be made only if permitted under applicable law and with prior written consent of the Company's Chief Compliance Officer and the Vice President—Governmental Affairs. The Company's corporate contributions made directly to political candidates or campaigns (excluding contributions to trade or business associations as further discussed below) have been, and are expected to continue to be, de minimus. With respect to contributions to a political candidate or campaign (excluding contributions to trade or business associations), the average individual contribution and the aggregate annual contributions made by the Company in 2018 were $2,438 and $78,000, respectively. 
 Business and Trade Associations—The Company is also a member of various business and trade associations that engage generally in education and advocacy efforts on a number of industry issues. The Company's Policy provides additional information regarding criteria for, and oversight of, the Company's participation in these associations. The political activity of such associations is not necessarily representative of a position of the Company, and the benefits that the Company receives from these trade or business associations are primarily expertise and the ability to gain insight on industry-setting standards. Payments made to business or trade associations are subject to the Company's Political Contribution Policy and are reviewed annually by the Governance and Nominating Committee. 
 Board Committee Oversight—The Company's political activities are reviewed annually by the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Company believes this oversight process ensures accountability and transparency for the Company's corporate political activities. 
The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company's stockholders for the Company to be an effective participant in the political process. Laws and policies enacted at the federal, state and local levels can have a significant impact on the Company and its customers, employees and stockholders. The Company actively encourages public policy that furthers its ability to provide reliable and affordable power to its customers in the markets served by the Company, while adhering to the Company's relentless commitment to safety. The Company's active participation in public policy is appropriate to ensure that public officials are informed about key issues that affect the interests of the Company's customers, employees, stockholders and the communities the Company serves. 
Subjecting the Company to additional disclosure requirements could also hinder the Company's ability to pursue its business and strategic objectives. Such additional disclosure would make it easier for competitors and others to discern the Company's public policy and political strategies and implement strategies opposed to the Company's public policy goals, which could prevent the achievement of such goals and negatively affect the Company, its operations and results. The Company believes that its responsible participation in the political process and its prudent expenditures in connection with such participation are in the best interests of the Company, its stockholders and its customers.

Finally, the Board believes that the report requested by the proposal would be an unproductive use of time. The Board believes existing disclosure of the Company's current policies and practices with regard to political expenditures, together with applicable federal, state and local reporting requirements, provide appropriate transparency of the 
Company's political participation. Undertaking the additional obligations required by the stockholder proposal would result in the use of valuable Company resources, unproductive consumption of time, and undue expense to the Company with little, if any, corresponding benefit for stockholders. 
For the foregoing reasons, the Board unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" this proposal.  Proxies received by the Board will be voted "AGAINST" this proposal unless a contrary vote is specified.

     Interest in Clearway    
[END TABLE]
NRG formed Clearway in 2013 to own and operate a portfolio of contracted generation assets and thermal infrastructure assets that have historically been owned and/or operated by NRG and its subsidiaries. Prior to August 31, 2018, we held, in the aggregate, 55.1% of the voting interest in Clearway's stock, through our ownership of Class B common stock and Class D common stock of Clearway. In February 2018, NRG entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Global Infrastructure Partners III LP (GIP) (the "NRG Transaction") for the acquisition of NRG's full ownership interest in Clearway and NRG's renewable energy development and operations platform. As a result of the NRG Transaction, which closed on August 31, 2018, NRG ceases to hold any ownership interest in Clearway. 
Prior to the closing of the NRG Transaction, NRG provided or arranged to provide Clearway with various management and administration services pursuant to a Management Services Agreement, dated as of July 22, 2013 ("Management Services Agreement"). As part of the services provided, certain executive officers of NRG also served as executive officers of Clearway. These executive officers were not separately compensated for their services to Clearway. Under the Management Services Agreement, Clearway paid a base management fee to NRG, which base management fee was adjusted for inflation annually at an inflation factor based on year-over-year CPI. Clearway also reimbursed NRG for any out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in the provision of the management and administration services. For the eight-month period ended August 31, 2018, Clearway incurred a total of approximately $7 million consisting of management fees of approximately $6 million and reimbursement for expenses, under the Management Services Agreement. On August 31, 2018, in connection with the consummation of the NRG Transaction, NRG entered into a Termination Agreement with Clearway Energy LLC and Clearway Energy Operating LLC terminating the Management Services Agreement. 
Subsequent to the NRG Transaction, NRG entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement") with Clearway, pursuant to which NRG or certain of its affiliates commenced providing certain services to Clearway following the consummation of the NRG Transaction, in exchange for the payment of a fee in respect of such services. The agreement is effective until the earlier of June 30, 2019 or the date that all services are terminated by Clearway. Clearway may extend the term on a month-by-month basis no later than March 31, 2020 for a fixed monthly fee provided for in the agreement.

This Related Person Policy also provides that certain transactions, based on their nature and/or monetary amount, are deemed to be pre-approved or ratified by the Governance and Nominating Committee and do not require separate approval or ratification. 
Transactions involving ongoing relationships with a Related Person will be reviewed and assessed at least annually by the Governance and Nominating Committee to ensure that such Related Person Transactions remain appropriate and in compliance with the Governance and Nominating Committee's guidelines. The Governance and Nominating Committee's activities with respect to the review and approval or ratification of all Related Person Transactions are reported periodically to the Board.

    Executive Summary    
[END TABLE]
The objectives of our executive compensation program are to align executive pay with stockholder value and to motivate executives to achieve our corporate goals. This CD&A describes the elements, implementation, and 2018 results of our executive compensation program. 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we received 98% support for our say on pay proposal. As a result, we believe that our stockholders understand that our pay practices demonstrate our commitment to pay for performance and that our compensation plans are designed to recognize the performance of the Company. We achieved many of our operational and financial goals in 2018, including exceeding our Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Corporate Debt to Corporate EBITDA Ratio targets, despite the challenges in the markets in which we operate. 
During 2017, we announced a three-year, three-part plan, referred to as our Transformation Plan, which was designed to significantly strengthen earnings and cost competitiveness, lower risk and volatility, and create significant shareholder value. In 2018, we executed on our Transformation Plan and produced the following results in line with our business strategy:
The achievements in 2018 resulted in payments under the AIP as described in more detail in the section of this CD&A entitled "Annual Incentive Compensation", and our LTIP, as described in more detail in the section of this CD&A entitled "Long-Term Incentive Compensation." 
Consistent with the objectives of our compensation program, the accomplishment of our corporate goals and the market performance of our common stock over the three-year performance period directly impacted our compensation decisions and pay outcomes for 2018 as described below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Due to the increase in TSR of approximately 290% as calculated in accordance with the terms of outstanding MSU awards during the performance period ending January 4, 2019, our  NEOs received a payout at 200% of target upon the vesting of their MSU awards that were granted in 2016.    
[END TABLE]
Our compensation program ties a significant portion of our NEOs' ovrall compensation to the achievement of increases in TSR through our long-term compensation program. In accordance with the intended design of our long-term compensation program, MSU awards for the performance period ending January 2, 2018 (vesting January 2, 2018) had a small increase in TSR during the performance period and vested at 108% of target. However, there was a 290% increase in TSR over the three-year performance period ending January 4, 2019 (vesting January 4, 2019) and, as a result, MSU awards vesting as of such date vested at 200% of target. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    The AIP performance metrics were exceeded during 2018, which resulted in payments to our NEOs at levels greater than target.    
[END TABLE]
Our Adjusted Free Cash Flow exceeded target, and our Corporate Debt to Corporate EBITDA Ratio exceeded the maximum; however, Adjusted EBITDA fell just below target. Due to the achievement of the AIP performance metrics, our NEOs received AIP awards at levels above target. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Performance-based equity measured NRG's TSR performance relative to the TSR of a comparator group.  
[END TABLE]
Consistent with market practice, in 2017, we shifted performance-based equity from MSU awards to RPSU awards. For each of the January 2017, 2018 and 2019 grants, NEOs received two-thirds of their equity awards in RPSUs in lieu of MSUs. The quantity of shares received by NEOs upon the vesting of an RPSU award will be a function of the Company's performance ranked against the Performance Peer Group (as defined in Elements of Compensation—Relative Performance Stock Units). The Compensation Committee evaluated this comparator group for an appropriate mix of industry-specific and market-influenced constituents, with a strong mathematical correlation to the Company's stock performance. RPSU awards granted in 2018 and 2019 were updated to limit the maximum award value that an NEO may receive to six times the fair market value of the target award, determined as of the date of grant. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   For 2018, our Compensation Committee approved no or modest increases to base salary for our NEOs.    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee approved modest increases of approximately 2% to 2018 base salary compensation for NEOs other than the CEO, who did not receive an increase in base salary.

     Goals and Objectives of the Program    
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee designs and implements an executive compensation program that:
The Compensation Committee is responsible for the development and implementation of NRG's executive compensation program. The intent of our executive compensation program is to reward the achievement of NRG's annual goals and objectives and the creation of long-term stockholder value. 
The Compensation Committee is committed to aligning executives' compensation with performance. The Compensation Committee's objectives are achieved through the use of both short-term and long-term incentives. The Company currently targets pay at the median of our Compensation Peer Group (defined below). In addition, through the AIP, the NEOs are rewarded for achieving annual corporate and individual goals. Our long-term incentive compensation program is designed to reward our NEOs for long-term TSR.

   Compensation Consultant    
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee is authorized to engage, at the expense of the Company, a compensation consultant to provide independent advice, support, and expertise to assist the Compensation Committee in overseeing and reviewing our overall executive compensation strategy, structure, policies and programs, and to assess whether our compensation structure establishes appropriate incentives for management and other key employees. 
Pay Governance, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant since fiscal year 2015, assisted with executive and director pay decisions and worked with the Compensation Committee to formulate the design of the executive compensation program for 2018. 
Pay Governance reported directly to the Compensation Committee and provided no other remunerated services to the Company. Pay Governance also provided services to the Compensation Committee of Clearway Energy, Inc., formerly known as NRG Yield Inc., while it was our majority-owned subsidiary, relating to the design of its director compensation and executive compensation programs for 2018. Clearway Energy, Inc. is currently not a subsidiary or affiliate of the Company. Pay Governance does not provide services for any of our affiliates. In accordance with SEC rules and requirements, the Company has affirmatively determined that no conflicts of interest exist between the Company and Pay Governance (or any individuals working on the Company's account on behalf of Pay Governance).

   Compensation Peer Group Analysis    
[END TABLE]
   Our 2018 Compensation Peer Group  
The Compensation Committee, with support from its advisors, identifies the best possible comparator group within relevant industries. The Compensation Committee performed a review of potential peer companies, considering factors such as industry, scope of operations, market value and relevance from a talent competition standpoint. In addition, a peer of peer analysis was conducted to confirm the appropriateness of potential peer companies and to assess companies that NRG's peers use in their own peer groups. The Compensation Committee then considered the overall reasonableness of the list of potential peer companies as a whole.

The Compensation Committee aims to compare our executive compensation program to a consistent compensation peer group year-to-year, but given the dynamic nature of our industry and the companies that comprise it, we annually examine the list for opportunities for improvement. In light of NRG's focus on its retail and core generation businesses, and with the assistance of Pay Governance, the Compensation Committee identified a new peer group for compensation benchmarking purposes in 2018 (Compensation Peer Group). The updated Compensation Peer Group for 2018 is identified below.

   Elements of Compensation    
[END TABLE]
We use the median percentile of our Compensation Peer Group as a guidepost in establishing the targeted total direct compensation (base salary, annual cash incentive and equity) levels for our NEOs. We expect that, over time, targeted total direct compensation of our NEOs will continue to land near the median of our Compensation Peer Group, and actual pay in a given year will increase or decrease based on the achievement of defined performance-based compensation metrics. 
While a portion of our compensation is fixed, a significant percentage is risk-based and payable and/or realizable only if certain performance objectives are met. The following charts illustrate the target percentage of annual fixed compensation, time-based compensation and performance-based compensation payable to our CEO, CFO and other NEOs on an average basis. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Base Salary    
[END TABLE]
Base salary compensates NEOs for their level of experience and position responsibilities and for the continued expectation of superior performance. Recommendations on increases to base salary take into account, among other factors, the NEO's individual performance, the general contributions of the NEO to overall corporate performance, and the level of responsibility of the NEO with respect to his or her specific position. 
The Compensation Committee approved modest increases of approximately 2% to 2018 base salary compensation for NEOs other than the CEO, who did not receive an increase in base salary.

   Annual Incentive Compensation    
[END TABLE]
   Overview  
Annual incentive compensation awards (AIP awards) are made under our AIP. AIP awards are short-term compensation designed to compensate NEOs for meeting annual individual and Company goals, both financial and non-financial. The annual incentive compensation opportunity is defined as a percentage of each NEO's annual base salary. AIP awards are subject to certain requirements, including a threshold Adjusted Free Cash Flow performance metric (AIP Gate). For 2018, the AIP Gate was $827 million, a level the Compensation Committee believes was appropriate for a minimally acceptable level of financial performance. If the AIP Gate is not achieved, no AIP awards are paid, regardless of performance in any other metrics. 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee set the following financial performance metric levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

In addition, each NEO is evaluated on his or her achievement of individual performance criteria, which include measures that NRG values in the leadership of the business. Such measures may include cost control, succession planning and staff development, and individual performance in furtherance of the Company's goals. Additional criteria may be chosen, as appropriate, and may change from time to time throughout the year. For 2018, individual performance criteria were measured against the achievement of the 2018 components of the Transformation Plan. The 2018 components of the Transformation Plan included the realization of annual cost savings of $500 million, margin enhancements of $30 million and the completion of asset sales totaling $3 billion. The Compensation Committee assesses performance of each NEO relative to the performance criteria applicable to each NEO and adjusts the total AIP award for each NEO by a factor of plus or minus 20%, based on recommendations from the CEO for each NEO other than himself. The Compensation Committee retains sole discretion under the AIP to reduce the amount of, or eliminate any, AIP awards that are otherwise payable under the AIP.

   Long-Term Incentive Compensation    
[END TABLE]
We believe that equity awards directly align our NEOs' interests with those of our stockholders. For our 2018 grants, we awarded our NEOs a combination of RPSU awards, which are based on the Company's TSR performance relative to its peers, and time-based RSU awards. The large majority of long-term incentive compensation (67%) was delivered using RPSUs, demonstrating the Compensation Committee's focus on pay for performance. Due to its retention aspects, we continued to award RSUs, although they comprised only 33% of each NEO's grant date award opportunity for the 2018. We believe that our AIP appropriately focuses our executive team on shorter-term (one-year) financial metrics while emphasizing long-term stockholder value creation (i.e., three-year TSR performance).  
   Range of LTIP compensation  
The aggregate value of equity awards granted to each NEO for fiscal year 2018 was reviewed relative to NEO compensation data from our Compensation Peer Group. Pay Governance provided compensation benchmark data for the Compensation Peer Group, as well as for broader industry practice, to the Compensation Committee. Our practice is to issue annual equity awards on the first trading day of the calendar year. For fiscal year 2018, the grant date was January 2, 2018. The closing price per share of the Company's stock on the grant date was $28.90 per share.  
   Relative Performance Stock Units  
Each RPSU represents the potential to receive one share of common stock after the completion of three years of service from the date of grant based on the Company's TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of a strongly correlated comparator group (the Performance Peer Group). Relative measures are designed to compensate for externalities, ensuring the program appropriately reflects management's impact on the Company's TSR by including peer companies and indices that are similarly impacted by market conditions. 
The payout of shares of common stock at the end of the three-year performance period will be based on the Company's TSR performance percentile rank, compared with the TSR performance of the Performance Peer Group. The following table illustrates the design of our RPSUs in 2018. Additional details regarding RPSU awards are set forth following the Grants of Plan-Based Awards for Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2018 table.

[END TABLE]
   Table of Contents 
RPSU awards granted in 2018 were updated to limit the maximum award value that an NEO may receive to six times (6x) the fair market value of the target award, determined as of the date of grant.  
   Restricted Stock Units  
Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock after the completion of the applicable vesting period. The RSU awards granted in 2018 vest ratably, meaning that one-third of the award vests each year on the anniversary of the grant date, over a three-year period. Occasionally, the Compensation Committee will use alternate RSU vesting periods, but only on an exception basis, such as for a new-hire with a specific skill set or to serve as an enhanced retention tool.  
   Market Stock Units  
Each MSU represents the potential to receive common stock after the completion of three years of service from the date of grant based on absolute NRG stock price change (plus dividends) versus a baseline. The number of shares of common stock to be paid as of the vesting date for each MSU award is equal to a TSR Multiplier times the target MSUs on the date of grant. The "TSR Multiplier" is the 20-trading day average closing price on the vesting date divided by the 20-trading day average closing price on the grant date, taking into account any dividends issued during the performance period, presumed reinvested as of the ex-dividend date. The TSR Multiplier thresholds and the valuation premium attributable to the awards are the features that tie the value of our MSU awards to NRG's performance. Payout of stock for MSU awards are based on TSR performance over the three-year performance period. In 2017, the Compensation Committee replaced MSU awards with RPSU awards. As a result, the last outstanding MSU awards vested in January 2019.  
   Dividend Equivalent Rights  
In connection with awards of RPSUs, RSUs, and MSUs, each NEO also receives DERs, which accrue with respect to the award to which they relate. Accrued DERs are paid at the same time that the shares of common stock underlying each award are delivered to the NEO. No DERs are paid if the underlying shares fail to vest.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Clawbacks    
[END TABLE]
The Company has a "clawback" policy with regard to awards made under the AIP and LTIP in the case of a material financial restatement, including a restatement that was the result of employee misconduct, or in the case of fraud, embezzlement or other serious misconduct that was materially detrimental to the Company. The Compensation Committee retains discretion regarding application of the policy. The policy is incremental to other remedies that are available to the Company. In addition to NRG's clawback policy, if the Company is required to restate its earnings as a result of noncompliance with a financial reporting requirement due to misconduct, under the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002 (SOX), the CEO and the CFO would also be subject to a clawback, as required by SOX.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Benefits    
[END TABLE]
NEOs participate in the same retirement, life insurance, health and welfare plans as other salaried employees of the Company. To generally support more complicated financial planning and estate planning matters, in 2018 NEOs were reimbursed for personal financial services up to $12,000 and $3,000 for EVPs and SVPs, respectively, not including the financial advisor's travel or out-of-pocket expenses. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement entered into in December 2015, described in more detail in the section entitled "Employment Agreements" below, for 2018, Mr. Gutierrez may receive additional benefits in the form of term life insurance with a death benefit of $7.75 million, and up to $10,000 for reimbursement of disability insurance premiums. We also provide certain security measures for Mr. Gutierrez to address safety concerns given his position as our President and CEO. We paid for the initial procurement, installation and maintenance of personal residential security measures for Mr. Gutierrez. This security program is intended to decrease security threats to Mr. Gutierrez, which is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. As such, we believe the costs incurred in implementing these security measures are appropriate, reasonable and necessary, and we do not consider Mr. Gutierrez's overall security program to be a perquisite for his benefit. However, the costs related to Mr. Gutierrez's personal security are reported in the "All Other Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table, below. We do not provide any gross-ups on perquisites for executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Potential Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits    
[END TABLE]
We choose to pay severance and change-in-control benefits to assist with career transitions of our executives as well as to create an environment that provides for an adequate business transition and knowledge transfer during times of change. 
Change-in-control agreements are market practice among publicly-held companies. Most often, these agreements are utilized to encourage executives to remain with the company during periods of extreme job uncertainty and to evaluate a potential transaction in an impartial manner. In order to enable a smooth transition during an interim period, change-in-control agreements provide a defined level of security for the executive and the company, enabling a more seamless implementation of a particular acquisition or an asset sale or purchase, and subsequent integration. 
Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Gutierrez is entitled to severance payments and benefits in the event

Pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Executive Change-in-Control and General Severance Plan for Tier IA and Tier IIA Executives (CIC Plan), NEOs other than Mr. Gutierrez are entitled to a change-in-control benefit. 
For a more detailed discussion, including the quantification of potential payments, please see the section entitled "Severance and Change-in-Control" following the executive compensation tables below.

   Oversight of Risks Related to Compensation Policies    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing risks related to our compensation policies and practices. The Company's Enterprise Risk Management team is responsible for assisting the Compensation Committee with its oversight and analysis of these risks. To assist the Compensation Committee with determining whether the Company's compensation policies and practices subject the Company to unnecessary risk or could potentially motivate employees to take excessive risk, the Company's Enterprise Risk Management team conducted a review of these policies and practices for the 2018 fiscal year and reported to the Compensation Committee its findings as follows:
Furthermore, the Enterprise Risk Management team has continued to evaluate and review new or amended compensation policies or practices and has reported its findings to the Compensation Committee, which are consistent with the principles identified above. 
As a result of the review, management and the Compensation Committee have concluded that the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies    
[END TABLE]
The Company prohibits executive officers, directors and employees from directly or indirectly engaging in any kind of hedging transaction that could reduce or limit their economic risk with respect to their holdings, ownership or interest in the Company's securities, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, puts, calls and options. The Company also prohibits executive officers, directors and employees from directly or indirectly engaging in any transaction in which the Company's securities are being pledged.

     Stock Ownership Guidelines    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee and the Board require each NEO to hold NRG stock with a value equal to a multiple of his or her base salary until his or her termination, as set forth in the table below. Personal holdings, vested awards and unvested, time-based RSUs count towards the ownership multiple. Unvested relative performance stock units and non-qualified stock options do not count towards the ownership multiple. Although the NEOs are not required to make purchases of our common stock to meet their target ownership multiple, NEOs are restricted from divesting any securities until such ownership multiples are attained, except in the event of a hardship or to make a required tax payment, and must maintain their ownership multiple after any such transactions. The current stock ownership for NEOs as of March 1, 2019 is shown below, based on the closing share price of $42.20 on March 1, 2019:

   Tax and Accounting Considerations    
[END TABLE]
Section 162(m) of the Code precludes us, as a public company, from taking a tax deduction for individual compensation to any NEO who is a "covered employee" in excess of $1 million, subject to certain exemptions. Prior to 2018, the exemptions included an exclusion of performance-based compensation within the meaning of Section 162(m). The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, however, amended Section 162(m) and eliminated the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the $1 million limit, subject to certain new exemptions for performance-based compensation that is "grandfathered" compensation within the meaning of amended Section 162(m). The Compensation Committee believes tax deductibility of compensation is an important consideration and, for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the implications of legislative changes to 
Section 162(m) and the possible effect of exemptions for grandfathered plans. However, the Compensation Committee also believes that it is important to retain flexibility in designing compensation programs, and as a result, has not adopted a policy that any particular amount of compensation must be deductible to NRG under Section 162(m). 
The Compensation Committee also takes into account tax consequences to NEOs in designing the various elements of our compensation program, such as designing the terms of awards to defer immediate income recognition in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. The Compensation Committee remains informed of and takes into account the accounting implications of its compensation programs. However, the Compensation Committee approves programs based on their total alignment with our strategy and long-term goals.

   2018 Annual Incentive Plan  
NEOs were provided the opportunity to earn an AIP awards based on the attainment of certain pre-established Company and individual goals for fiscal year 2018. The performance criteria and weight given to each are described in detail in the CD&A. The dollar amount of the possible AIP award payments for achieving the threshold, target or maximum levels of performance during the fiscal year 2018 are shown in the above table. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement because it is in material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements, then any NEO who has received a payment under the AIP may be required to reimburse the Company for all or a portion of the payment (commonly referred to as a clawback). 
   2018 Long-Term Equity Incentives  
Long-term equity incentive grants to NEOs in 2018 consisted of RPSU awards and RSU awards. Consistent with our policy, these awards were granted to NEOs as of the first trading day of the fiscal year, i.e., January 2, 2018. Awards under the Company's LTIP contain a "double trigger" provision, meaning the vesting of the awards will not accelerate unless there is a termination of employment in connection with a change-in-control. 
   Relative Performance Stock Units  
Each RPSU represents the potential to receive common stock after the completion of three years of service from the date of grant based on the Company's TSR performance ranked against the TSR performance of the Performance Peer Group. The payout of shares of common stock at the end of the three-year performance period will be based on the Company's TSR performance percentile rank, compared with the TSR performance of the

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
Performance Peer Group. To ensure a rigorous program design, the target-level payout (100% of shares granted) requires the Company to perform above median, at the 55th percentile. To induce management to achieve greater than target-level performance in a down market, in the event that NRG's TSR performance declines by more than 15% over the performance period, target-level payout (100% of shares granted) will require an even greater achievement at the 65th percentile performance. The Compensation Committee believes that this increased performance requirement addresses the concern that a disproportionate award may be paid in the event that our relative performance is high, but absolute performance is low. 
In the event relative performance is below the 25th percentile, the award is forfeited. In the event relative performance is at the 25th percentile, the quantity of shares paid out is equal to 25% of target. In the event relative performance is between the 25th percentile and the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if our TSR performance declines by more than 15% over the performance period), payout will be based on an interpolated calculation. In the event relative performance reaches the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if our TSR performance declines by more than 15% over the performance period), 100% of the target award will be paid. In the event relative performance is between the 55th percentile (or the 65th percentile if our TSR performance declines by more than 15% over the performance period) and the 75th percentile, payout will be based on an interpolated calculation. In the event relative performance is at or above the 75th percentile, the quantity of shares paid out is equal to 200% of target. RPSU awards granted in 2018 were updated to limit the maximum award value that an NEO may receive to six times the fair market value of the target award, determined as of the date of grant. 
If the NEO's employment is terminated as a result of a change-in-control, a final RPSU award, if any, will be determined by the Compensation Committee. If the NEO's employment is terminated for any reason other than death, a qualifying disability, a qualifying retirement, or, with respect to any NEO who is a SVP at the time of grant, an eligible termination (as described below), including, without limitation, termination of service as a result of voluntary resignation or termination for cause, the RPSU award will expire and be forfeited. In the event of a termination of service by reason of death or a qualifying disability, whereby the NEO's employment is terminated due to a total and permanent disability, the RPSU award will vest in full at the target level and the common stock underlying the award will be issued to the NEO or in the case of death, the NEO's legal representatives, heirs, legatees, or distributees. A qualifying retirement occurs in the event that an NEO, who is at least 55 years of age at the time of retirement, retires with more than 10 years of service to the Company. In such event, if the retirement occurs at least 12 months after the grant date, the final RPSU award will continue to vest throughout the remainder of the performance period. In addition to these rights, SVPs who are such at the time of grant are also entitled to a pro-rata award in the event of an eligible termination, which means an involuntary termination of service in connection with the sale of a business segment, restructuring or reduction in workforce. 
   Restricted Stock Units  
Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of common stock as of the vesting date for the award. RSU awards granted in 2018 vest ratably, meaning that one-third of the award vests each year on the anniversary of the grant date, over a three-year period. If the NEO's employment is terminated as a result of a change-in-control, an RSU award vests in full upon the later of such change-in-control or termination of employment and the common stock underlying the RSU shall be issued and delivered to the NEO. Any unvested portion of the RSU award is forfeited if the NEO's employment is terminated for any reason other than death of the NEO, a qualifying disability, a qualifying retirement, or, with respect to an NEO who is a SVP at the time of grant, an eligible termination (as described below), including, without limitation, termination of service as a result of voluntary resignation or termination for cause. In the event of a termination of service by reason of death or a qualifying disability, whereby the NEO's employment is terminated due to a total and permanent disability, the RSU award will vest in full and the common stock underlying the award will be issued to the NEO or in the case of death, the NEO's legal representatives, heirs, legatees, or distributees. A qualifying retirement occurs in the event that an NEO, who is at least 55 years of age at the time of retirement, retires with more than 10 years of service to the Company. In such event, if the retirement occurs at least 12 months after the grant date, the unvested portion of an RSU award will continue to vest according to the vesting schedule. In addition to these rights, SVPs who are such at the time of the grant are also entitled to a pro-rata award in the event of an eligible termination, which means an involuntary termination of service in connection with the sale of a business segment, restructuring or reduction in workforce.

 David R. Hill   —   —   —   —  
[END TABLE]
The NRG Pension Plan for Non-Bargained Employees provides qualified retirement income benefits to most NRG employees who were hired prior to December 5, 2003. The plan was closed to new employees as of that date. Mr. Chillemi was the only NEO eligible to receive benefits under this plan. He was covered under the "Final Average Pay" formula which provides a single life annuity equal to 1% of three year average pay times years of credited service. The service period was frozen as of April 1, 2001. However, pay continued to grow. Annual pension earnings included base pay and was capped by the Internal Revenue Service qualified plan pay limit each year. For example, the 2018 pay limit was $225,000. Pension benefits are 100% vested after five years of service and a participant may retire as early as age 50. At retirement, the participant will receive a monthly annuity. None of the NEOs are covered by any nonqualified pension programs. Actuarial equivalent annuities are determined using factors defined in a plan document. For additional information on the assumptions used in calculating the present value of the accumulated benefit under the plan, see Item 15—Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

    Employment Agreements    
[END TABLE]
Mr. Gutierrez serves as the President and CEO of the Company pursuant to the terms of an employment agreement with the Company effective December 3, 2015. The term of the employment agreement will continue until the date that Mr. Gutierrez's employment is terminated by either Mr. Gutierrez or the Company. 
Each year, Mr. Gutierrez's base salary will be reviewed and may be increased by the Board. The Board may decrease Mr. Gutierrez's base salary solely in the case of an across the board adjustment for senior executives, but not in excess of the same percentage as other senior executives as a group. Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement, for the 2018 fiscal year, Mr. Gutierrez is eligible to receive an annual incentive award with a target amount of up to 125% of his base salary, and an additional maximum incentive award with a target amount of up to 125% of his base salary, each based upon the achievement of criteria determined at the beginning of the fiscal year by the Compensation Committee with input from Mr. Gutierrez. 
The employment agreement also provides that Mr. Gutierrez is eligible to participate in the Company's LTIP in accordance with its terms. For the 2019 fiscal year, Mr. Gutierrez's target LTIP award is 425% of his base salary. Mr. Gutierrez is also entitled to health, welfare and retirement benefits, term life insurance of $7.75 million, five weeks paid vacation, and coverage under the Company's director and officer liability insurance coverage, in addition to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses, financial planning expenses, and disability insurance premiums. Mr. Gutierrez's employment agreement also entitles him to certain severance payments and benefits in the event his employment terminates under certain circumstances. These severance payments and benefits are described and quantified under the section "Severance and Change-in-Control" below. In addition, under the employment agreement, the Company has agreed to indemnify Mr. Gutierrez against any claims arising as a result of his position with the Company to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
The Company has not entered into employment agreements with NEOs other than Mr. Gutierrez.

   Severance and Change-In-Control    
   Mr. Gutierrez

Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Gutierrez may be entitled to severance payments and benefits in the event of termination of employment, including termination following a change-in-control.

Table of Contents
In the event Mr. Gutierrez's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company "without cause" or by Mr. Gutierrez for "good reason" (including a reduction of his base salary), Mr. Gutierrez will be entitled to two times his base salary (without regard for any reduction of base salary); 50% of the bonus he would have received upon satisfaction of the underlying performance conditions, prorated for the number of days he was employed with the Company in the year of termination; immediate vesting of the 2016 LTIP Award to the extent not already vested; reimbursement for COBRA benefits continuation cost for 18 months; and earned but unpaid base salary, bonuses, deferred compensation, vacation pay, and retirement benefits. 
In the event Mr. Gutierrez's employment with the Company is terminated by the Company "without cause" or by Mr. Gutierrez for "good reason" (including a reduction on his base salary), each within 24 months following a change-in-control, in lieu of the above severance benefits, Mr. Gutierrez will be entitled to three times the sum of (i) his base salary (without regard for any reduction of base salary) and (ii) his target annual bonus for the year of termination. Mr. Gutierrez will also be entitled to a payment equal to the bonus he would have received upon satisfaction of the underlying performance conditions, prorated for the number of days he was employed with the Company in the year of termination; immediate vesting of the 2016 LTIP Award to the extent not already vested; reimbursement for COBRA benefits continuation cost for 18 months; and earned but unpaid base salary, bonuses, deferred compensation, vacation pay, and retirement benefits. 
In the event Mr. Gutierrez's employment with the Company is terminated due to his death or disability, Mr. Gutierrez (or his estate) will be entitled to receive 50% of the target annual bonus, prorated for the number of days he was employed with the Company in the year of termination; earned but unpaid base salary, bonuses, deferred compensation, vacation pay and retirement benefit. 
As the Company has eliminated all tax gross-ups for all NEOs, if an excise tax under section 4999 of Internal Revenue Code (Code) would be triggered by any payments under the employment agreement or otherwise upon a change in control, the Company will either (a) pay Mr. Gutierrez any amounts subject to section 4999 of the Code (and Mr. Gutierrez will be responsible for the excise tax), or (b) reduce such payments so that no amounts are subject to section 4999 of the Code, whichever results in a better after-tax amount for Mr. Gutierrez (known as the "best net" approach). 
Under Mr. Gutierrez's employment agreement, Mr. Gutierrez agrees not to divulge confidential information and, during and for a period of one year after the termination of the employment agreement, disparage or compete with the Company, or solicit the customers or employees of the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   All Other NEOs    
[END TABLE]
Under the CIC Plan, the NEOs other than Mr. Gutierrez are entitled to a general severance benefit equal to 1.5 times base salary in the event of involuntary termination without cause payable in a lump sum amount and reimbursement for COBRA benefits continuation cost for a period of 18 months. 
The CIC Plan also provides a change-in-control benefit in the event that within six months prior to or 24 months following a change-in-control, NEO employment is either involuntarily terminated by the Company without cause or voluntarily terminated by the executive for good reason. The change-in-control benefit consists of an amount equal to 2.99 and 2.0 for Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents, respectively, times the sum of the executive's base salary plus the annual target incentive for the year of termination, payable in a lump sum amount; an amount equal to the NEO's target bonus for the year of termination, prorated for the number of days during the performance period that the NEO was employed by the Company; and reimbursement for COBRA benefits continuation cost for a period of 18 months. In the event of a change-in-control, vesting of equity awards will not accelerate unless the NEO is terminated in connection with the change-in-control. 
As with Mr. Gutierrez's employment agreement, under the CIC Plan, the applicable executive agrees not to divulge confidential information and, during and for a period of one year after the termination of the employment agreement, disparage or compete with the Company, or solicit the customers or employees of the Company. 
In general, a "change-in-control" occurs in the event: (a) any person or entity becoming the direct or indirect beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company's voting stock, (b) directors serving on the Board as of a specified date cease to constitute at least a majority of the Board unless such directors are approved by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of the incumbent directors, provided that a person whose assumption of office is in connection with an actual or threatened election contest or actual or threatened solicitation of proxies including by reason of agreement intended to avoid or settle such contest shall not be considered to be an incumbent director, (c) any reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or other transaction is consummated and the previous stockholders of the Company fail to own at least 50% of the combined voting power of the resulting entity or (d) the stockholders approve a plan or proposal to liquidate or dissolve the Company. 
An involuntary termination for "cause" means the NEO's termination by the Company because of (i) the NEO's conviction of, or agreement to a plea of nolo contendere to, a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude, (ii) willful failure to perform his or her duties or willful gross neglect or willful gross misconduct, (iii) the NEO's performance of any material act of theft, fraud,

Table of Contents malfeasance or dishonesty, (iv) the NEO's breach of any written agreement between the NEO and the Company or a violation of the Company's code of conduct or other written policies, and (v) any material breach of the NEO's obligations to the Company with respect to confidentiality, noncompetition, nonsolicitation and nondisparagement. An involuntary termination for any other reason is without "cause." A voluntary termination for "good reason" means the resignation of the NEO in the event of a material reduction in his or her compensation or benefits, a material diminution in his or her title, authority, duties or responsibilities, or the failure of a successor to the Company to assume the CIC Plan. In the case of Mr. Gutierrez only, "good reason" also includes any material failure by the Company to comply with his employment agreement, his removal from the Board, the failure to elect him to the Board during any regular election, or a change in reporting structure of the Company requiring Mr. Gutierrez to report to anyone other than the Board. The amount of compensation payable to each NEO in each circumstance is shown in the table below, assuming that termination of employment occurred as of December 31, 2018, and including payments that would have been earned as of such date. However, the amounts shown below do not include benefits payable under the 401(k) plan. Messrs. Chillemi and Hill are excluded from the table because their employment terminated on October 1, 2018. The severance payments made to Messrs. Chillemi and Hill are reported in the "All Other Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table, above.

For 2018, the total compensation of Mauricio Gutierrez, our President and Chief Executive Officer, of $8,914,948, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table (CEO Compensation), was approximately 77 times the total compensation of a median employee, calculated in the same manner, of $115,122. 
We calculated the ratio of the pay of our Chief Executive Officer to that of our median employee as permitted under SEC rules. As of December 31, 2018, we and our consolidated subsidiaries had 4,863 employees in the United States and 218 employees located in Australia. As allowed under Item 402 of Regulation S-K, we excluded the 218 employees in Australia from our median employee determination, which represented less than 5% of our total employees. 
For purposes of determining the median employee, we compared the total taxable wages as reported on each employee's Form W-2, as of December 31, 2018, for all individuals, other than our chief executive officer, who were employed by us on December 31, 2018 (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis). We then identified a median employee from that group for purposes of preparing the ratio of chief executive officer pay to median employee pay. We calculated the compensation for our median employee based upon the same components of compensation used to determine CEO Compensation. We believe that the ratio of CEO Compensation to that of this median employee is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.

   Realized Pay in 2018

NEO compensation for 2018 consisted of (i) base salary, earned and paid during the 2018 fiscal year, (ii) short-term incentive compensation pursuant to our AIP earned during the 2018 fiscal year, (iii) RSU awards that were granted in January 2016 and vested at the end of the following three-year period, (iv) approximately one-third of RSUs that were granted in January 2017 and January 2018, which vested on the one-year and two-year anniversary of the

Table of Contents grant date, respectively and (v) MSU awards that were granted in January 2016, whose realized value at the end of the three-year performance period (January 4, 2019) was based upon the Company's TSR performance over the three-year performance period following the grant date. 
The Compensation Committee believes that in 2018, the Company's compensation of its NEOs was aligned with our stock performance and our stockholder interests. During the three-year period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018, the Company's TSR increased 247% with an accompanying increase of $7.5 billion in market capitalization. 
By way of comparison, the CEO's target compensation over this period was $8.7 million comprised of $1.2 million in 2018 base salary, $1.5 million with respect to the CEO's 2018 target AIP Award, $3.2 million in grant date fair value 
(GDFV) for the CEO's 2016 target MSU award, and $2.8 million of GDFV in RSU awards. The RSU GDFV includes the full value of the 2016 three year cliff vesting RSU award, one-third of the 2017 ratable vesting RSU award, and one-third of the 2018 ratable vesting RSU award. The CEO's realized compensation was $29.1 million comprised of $1.2 million in 2018 base salary, $2.4 million in 2018 realized AIP Award, $17.5 million in MSU vested value, and $8 million in RSU vested value. Over 95% of the incremental difference between CEO target and realized value is driven by NRG's exceptional TSR performance over the period. 
Beginning in 2019, target and realized compensation will no longer include cliff vested RSU awards that fully vest at the end of the respective three-year period.

No member of our Compensation Committee has served as one of our officers or employees at any time. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of the Board. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Compensation Committee. 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent stockholders also are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us and any written representations that no Forms 5 were required, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were timely met during the 2018 fiscal year.

The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its general oversight of the Company's financial reporting process. The Audit Committee's function is more fully described previously in this Proxy Statement and in its charter. The Audit Committee reviews the charter on an annual basis. The Board annually reviews the New York Stock Exchange listing standards' definition of independence for audit committee members and has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets that standard. The Board has also determined that two of the three members of the Audit Committee, William E. Hantke and Anne C. Schaumburg, met the requirements of an "audit committee financial expert." The Board has further determined that Matthew Carter, Jr. met the "financial literacy" requirements set forth in the listing standards under the New York Stock Exchange. 
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Company's financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year 2018, KPMG LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles and auditing the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with the Company's management and has discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed. In addition, KPMG LLP has provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by Statement on the PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communication with Audit Committees," and the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP their independence. The Audit Committee also reviewed, and discussed with management and KPMG LLP, management's report and KPMG LLP's report and attestation on internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

   Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval    
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and permissible nonaudit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee annually reviews and pre-approves services that are expected to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The term of the pre-approval is 12 months from the date of the pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee approves a shorter time period. The Audit Committee may periodically amend and/or supplement the pre-approved services based on subsequent determinations. 
Unless the Audit Committee has pre-approved Audit Services or a specified category of nonaudit services, any engagement to provide such services must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee must also pre-approve any proposed services exceeding the pre-approved budgeted fee levels for a specified type of service. 
The Audit Committee has authorized its Chair to pre-approve services in amounts up to $500,000 per engagement. Engagements exceeding $500,000 must be approved by the full Audit Committee. Engagements pre-approved by the Chair are reported to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

All of our stockholders may attend the Annual Meeting. However, only stockholders who owned our common stock at the close of business on March 1, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting, or their duly appointed proxies, are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Many stockholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank, trustee, or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially:

As of the record date, 278,975,616 shares of our common stock, representing the same number of votes, were outstanding. The presence of the holders of at least 139,487,809 shares of our common stock will be required to establish a quorum. Both abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are counted as present for determining the presence of a quorum.

     What are Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes and How are They Treated?

An abstention occurs when a stockholder abstains from voting or does not vote on a proposal. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares because the proposal is non-routine. Brokers who do not receive instructions from the beneficial owner are entitled to vote on the ratification of KPMG LLP's appointment for the 2019 fiscal year, but not on the other proposals. Broker non-votes and abstentions, if any, will be treated as follows with respect to votes on each of the proposals:

     How Do I Vote?    
[END TABLE]
If you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record, you may vote by granting a proxy or, if you hold shares in street name (through a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee), by submitting voting instructions to your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee. You may vote over the Internet, by telephone, by mail if you have a paper copy of the proxy materials, or in person at the Annual Meeting. Please refer to the summary instructions below and those included on your proxy card or, for shares held in street name, the voting instruction card included by your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   May I Change My Vote?    
[END TABLE]
You may change your proxy instructions or revoke your proxy at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. 
For shares held directly in your name, you may accomplish this by: (a) delivering a written notice of revocation bearing a later date than the proxy being revoked, (b) signing and delivering a later dated written proxy relating to the same shares, or (c) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy). For shares held in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your bank, broker, trustee, or nominee, or by obtaining a legal proxy from your broker and voting your shares by ballot at the Annual Meeting.

If you are a record holder (i.e., you hold your shares through our transfer agent, Computershare), you must bring either a copy of the proxy card you received as part of your proxy materials, a copy of your Computershare account statement indicating your ownership of our common stock as of the record date, or the Notice of Availability, if you received one. 
If you hold your shares in street name (i.e., through a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee), you must bring either the voting instruction card you received from your bank, broker, trustee or other nominee as part of your proxy materials, a copy of your brokerage statement indicating your ownership of our common stock as of the record date, or the Notice of Availability, if you received one. 
If you are not a stockholder, but are attending the meeting as proxy for a stockholder, you must bring a valid legal proxy. If you attend as a proxy for a record holder, you must present a valid legal proxy from the record holder to you. If you attend as a proxy for a street name holder, you must present a valid legal proxy from the record holder (i.e., the bank, broker, trustee or other nominee) to the street name holder that is assignable, as well as a valid legal proxy from the street name holder to you.
