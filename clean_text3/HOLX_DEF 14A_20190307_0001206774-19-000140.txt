  At Hologic, our purpose is to enable healthier lives, everywhere, every day. The more lives we touch, the more our profits will grow over the long term.               January 18, 2019 DEAR FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS: Over the past few years, there has been increasing discussion, and often debate, over the role of the corporation in society, fueled by the rapid pace of social, political, economic and technological change. This dialogue has been carried on by business analysts, governance experts and academics around the world, but also by employees at companies large and small. In addition, large institutional investors are increasingly analyzing environmental, social and governance factors – sometimes known as ESG – as part of their investment process. For example, the CEO of BlackRock, the world's largest investment management company, wrote to CEOs in 2018: Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society… Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. As Hologic has evolved through organic growth, international expansion, acquisitions and divestitures, we've been talking about these issues too, alongside our board and with employees at all levels. As a public company, we recognize that we have a fundamental obligation to create value for shareholders through profitable, long-term growth. Indeed, public firms have helped create higher standards of living and longer lifespans over many generations and geographies. But this cannot be the whole story. To focus solely on financial outcomes would be to ignore the multifaceted, instrumental role that corporations play in our world. Indeed, most of our employees are motivated by a sense of higher purpose. Russell Pearlman of the Korn Ferry Institute said it well when he wrote, "purpose and profit not only peacefully co-exist, but purpose can drive profit." I completely agree. At Hologic, our purpose is to enable healthier lives, everywhere, every day. The more lives we touch, the more our profits will grow over the long term. Within this purpose, we place special emphasis on the healthcare needs of women. Our passion, therefore, is to become global champions for women's health. We believe that early detection of disease leads to better, more cost-effective health outcomes. In fact, no company in the world has done more to fight cervical and breast cancer than we have through our innovative diagnostic solutions. While women's health is not our only focus – we have introduced many products that also benefit men – it is our rallying cry. We believe our unique passion is urgently needed today. For far too long, women's healthcare needs have been minimized by governments and healthcare systems in emerging – and developed – countries around the world. So we are inspired by the deep belief that our success as a company will fundamentally improve the health of millions of women and families globally.

Proxy Statement Summary
Performance Highlights
Hologic, Inc. is an innovative medical technology company primarily focused on improving women's health and well-being through early detection and treatment. The Company operates in four main areas: Breast & Skeletal Health, Diagnostics, GYN Surgical and Medical Aesthetics. Our market-leading products include our innovative Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ technology, our Affirm™ prone biopsy system, our Brevera® breast biopsy system, our ThinPrep® Pap test, our Aptima® infectious disease tests, our Panther® and Panther Fusion® fully automated molecular diagnostics instruments, our NovaSure® device for endometrial ablation, our MyoSure® system for intrauterine tissue removal, and our Cynosure® brands.
Over the past five years, under the guidance of a focused and motivated senior management team, almost all of whom joined the Company in fiscal 2014 or later, we have made great progress toward building a sustainable growth company. Our solid financial results in fiscal 2018 reflect the progress we have made. The year started slowly, with our core domestic businesses (excluding the acquired medical aesthetics and divested blood screening franchises) declining slightly in the first half of the year. However, our performance improved significantly over the course of fiscal 2018, led by our domestic Breast Health and Molecular Diagnostics businesses as well as our International businesses. Operational highlights from the year include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Growth rates in our domestic Breast Health and Surgical businesses improved over the course of the year. 
● Our international franchises showed strong, consistent growth, reflecting the investments we have made in new leadership, capabilities and infrastructure and contributions from distributor acquisitions in the Breast Health business. 
● Breast Health emerged as a more diversified, sustainable growth business, evolving from a domestic capital franchise into a steady, global growth business across the continuum of breast health care. For example, we recently acquired Faxitron Bioptics and, just after fiscal year end, Focal Therapeutics, to expand into the adjacent growth market of breast-conserving surgery. 
● Our Molecular Diagnostics business continued to perform well as we placed more fully automated Panther systems and increased the number of assays that customers can run on the platform. 
● Research and development pipelines matured across our businesses, and sales of new products increased significantly. 
[END TABLE]
Financial highlights from fiscal 2018 are shown below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Worldwide Revenue 5%  International     Revenue 17%  Share   Repurchases  Debt  Stock Price 12% 
 Full-year GAAP revenue increased 5%, in part due to the acquisition of Cynosure and contributions from two distributor acquisitions.  International revenue increased 17%, in part due to the acquisition of Cynosure and the contributions of two distributor acquisitions.  Our strong cash flow enabled us to repurchase 7.3 million shares of our stock during fiscal 2018, and we ended the year with fewer diluted shares outstanding.  Even with share repurchases and several acquisitions, debt declined slightly and we eliminated all convertible debt from our balance sheet.  The price per share of our common stock increased 12% from the last day of fiscal 2017 to the last day of fiscal 2018. 
[END TABLE]
Looking ahead, we are focused on driving sustainable, long-term growth, and believe we have significant opportunities ahead of us.
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  We remain significantly under-penetrated internationally, as only 25% of our sales were generated outside of the United States in fiscal 2018. ✓  We have many opportunities to leverage our commercial strengths – such as our large Genius 3D and Panther installed bases – for future growth. ✓  We continue our commitment to fuel growth by enhancing the research and development pipelines in each area of our business and by executing focused acquisitions. ✓  Multiple opportunities to increase operational efficiency and repurchase shares should enable us to continue to grow earnings per share faster than sales.

It is also exceptionally balanced by age (two directors in their 40s, three directors in their 50s and three directors in their 60s), gender (38% female) and geographic experience (38% born outside of the country). Given its smaller size, the Board is a collegial group, with each member contributing and having his or her voice heard while supporting and appropriately challenging management. The mix of experience, diversity and fresh perspectives on the Board serves to strengthen management and the Company.

Proxy Statement Summary
Board Assessment and Refreshment
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is continually evaluating our Board composition. In 2015, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee led a Board assessment which included a Board peer review, managed by our general counsel. In 2016, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee continued to spearhead the assessment process by leading a facilitated discussion to evaluate the functioning and composition of the Board and its committees. In 2017 and 2018, the full Board and each Board committee completed anonymous written evaluations, the results of which were shared with the Board and each respective committee. All evaluations were reviewed in detail by the Chairman and the Lead Independent Director, who led a discussion with the full Board highlighting both areas of strength and areas of opportunity.
Our Board has shown an ongoing commitment to Board refreshment and to having highly qualified, independent voices in the boardroom. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recognizes that board refreshment is essential to ensuring that the composition of our Board evolves to meet the needs of an evolving Company. Since March 2016, eight directors have rotated off of our Board, including two representatives from the Icahn group, one director who resigned due to a conflict with another board, and five who were among our longest-tenured directors (one of whom had reached retirement age). Since March 2016, five new independent directors have been elected to our Board. Currently, 75 percent of our directors have been on our Board for five years or less.

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
The Board annually assesses the efficacy of having a Lead Independent Director and a combined Chairman/CEO. In each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Board affirmed its June 2015 decision to combine the Chairman and CEO roles and to appoint a Lead Independent Director. Further, as detailed on page 28, Hologic's Corporate Governance Guidelines establish clearly defined roles and responsibilities designed to ensure that the Lead Independent Director retains a strong and independent voice in leading the Board.
COMMITTEE ROTATION
The Board assesses the structure and composition of its committees at least annually. In December 2017, the Board expanded the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to include all existing independent members of the Board to allow the full Board to fully participate in the search for a new director. Also in December 2017, Mr. Dockendorff was appointed chair of the Audit and Finance Committee, Mr. Garrett was appointed chair of the Compensation Committee, and Ms. Crawford was appointed Lead Independent Director and chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, all resulting in new leadership roles for these directors. In January 2018, Mr. Nawana joined our Board and was appointed to the Compensation Committee as well as to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and the size of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee was reduced. In November 2018, Dr. Hantson joined our Board and was appointed to serve on the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
BOARD RETIREMENT AGE POLICY
Risk Oversight
Our Board receives regular reports from management on matters relating to strategic and operational initiatives, financial performance and legal developments, including the related enterprise-risk exposures. The involvement of the Board in the oversight of our strategic planning process is a key part of its assessment of the risks inherent in our corporate strategy. Our general counsel and corporate secretary lead the Company's annual enterprise risk assessment, presenting a comprehensive but targeted risk management report to the Board each year, and, along with the CEO, report on evolving risks and mitigation actions throughout the year, as warranted. As part of the annual process, risk is assessed throughout the business on a three-year horizon, focusing on financial risk, legal/compliance risk and operational/strategic risk. The resulting enterprise risk management report ("ERM report") details the Company's top 10 risks, as well as mitigating actions and plans relating to those risks. The ERM report includes a rolling three-year evaluation period reflecting mitigation activity progress and risk rating changes and is presented to and discussed with the Board. Underscoring the Board's and management's focus on enterprise risk are the individual performance objectives of the executive leadership team for fiscal 2019, which are again aligned with the Company's top enterprise risks, as identified in the ERM report.
Leadership Restructure and Succession Planning
The Board, as well as Mr. MacMillan, have a fundamental belief that people matter. At the end of fiscal 2017, Mr. MacMillan re-evaluated the Company's management structure and eliminated the position of Chief Operating Officer. This change brings Mr. MacMillan closer to the businesses – fostering more transparency and accountability. With Division Presidents reporting directly to him, Mr. MacMillan is driving even more urgency in commercial execution and also has a broader range of business development opportunities coming to him more quickly. As part of the leadership restructuring, Mr. MacMillan expanded his executive leadership team, forming the Global Leadership Team (GLT). This expanded group gives more leaders direct access to Mr. MacMillan. He also assumed responsibility from the Chief Operating Officer to conduct business reviews and leads quarterly business reviews with each division, including in the reviews members of the GLT along with the leadership team for the applicable division. Following this leadership restructuring, growth rates for the Company's largest businesses significantly accelerated over the course of the year, and the Company initiated and executed on two key tuck-in acquisitions in the Breast Health division.
Following Mr. MacMillan's potential departure last fall, the Board and Mr. MacMillan intensified their focus on succession planning. Succession planning starts with Mr. MacMillan, his team and the Compensation Committee, but is continued with the full Board. The Board devotes significant time on its agenda to succession planning, reviewing and discussing the succession www.hologic.com       11
Table of Contents
Proxy Statement Summary plans for the CEO and each of his direct reports. With the departure this summer of Bob McMahon, the Company's former CFO, such succession planning became more evident. Karleen Oberton, our current CFO, joined the GLT last fall, when she was the Corporate Vice President, Finance and Accounting, Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller. Her participation on the GLT gave her additional exposure to Mr. MacMillan and other members of the leadership team. This helped Mr. MacMillan and the Board feel confident in the succession plan in place and enabled a smooth transition for Ms. Oberton as she assumed the role of CFO - another benefit of Mr. MacMillan's leadership restructure.
Diversity and Inclusion
As our passion is to be global champions for women's health, Hologic is committed to creating an inclusive and diverse work environment that promotes equal opportunity, dignity and respect, starting with our Board and our leadership team. As noted above, three of our directors, representing 38% of the Board, are women. Also, three of our directors were born outside of the United States, and two were predominantly educated outside of the United States, which promotes global diversity for our Board. Hologic seeks to identify and develop high-potential women within the Company, and we are now beginning to see our next generation of leaders emerge. For example, in August 2018, Karleen Oberton was promoted to the position of CFO. Ms. Oberton has been with the Company for over 12 years and has a deep knowledge of our business. She has been instrumental in our efforts to both drive profitable growth and to strengthen our balance sheet and cash flows. Additionally, over the last 18 months, several women leaders were appointed to key commercial roles in our businesses. Our focus on talent development, engagement and succession planning is paying off.
Governance
Hologic is committed to good corporate governance, which we believe will help us to sustain our success and build long-term stockholder value.

[END TABLE]
LONG-TERM FOCUS
Financial results for one year are a snapshot of short-term performance. Our focus is on the long term. Since Mr. MacMillan joined the company in 2013, the Company has invested significantly in its people, infrastructure and products. The power of focused, motivated people is evident, and has driven growth in revenue and profits over the past five years.
NOVEMBER 2013
Before the current management team was in place, our organic sales and earnings were declining, we had $4.0 billion in debt, and we had no meaningful product pipeline. Our interest expense on our debt was higher than our expenditures on research and development (R&D).
SEPTEMBER 2018
Under the stewardship of our management team, with significant contributions by our commercial teams, our sales have not only stopped declining, but our largest divisions are driving growth. In fiscal 2018, organic growth (growth excluding the impact of the Cynosure acquisition and disposition of the blood screening business) was led by our international businesses, our molecular diagnostics products including Panther and APTIMA, and our Breast Health business.
In addition to revenue growth, the Company's disciplined approach to strengthening the balance sheet also has paid off. From fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018 our net debt, which is total debt minus cash, decreased from $4.0 billion to $2.6 billion, our ROIC improved significantly, and our strong free cash flow enabled us to repurchase shares of our common stock.
While decreasing our debt, we also have increased our R&D spending by double-digits since 2013. This investment is yielding benefits, as evidenced by the multiple new product launches in 2018. New product sales tripled from 2017 to 2018.
These improvements have helped drive our share price. Our share price has increased by 96% since 2013, based on a comparison of the closing price on the last trading day of fiscal 2013 to the closing price on the last trading day of fiscal 2018. We are committed to bringing value to our stockholders, as well as to our employees and customers, over the long term.
SPECIAL RETENTION EQUITY GRANT
In light of his long track record of success, other larger medical device and healthcare companies have expressed interest over time in hiring Mr. MacMillan to serve as Chief Executive Officer. In October 2017, Mr. MacMillan received such an offer from a larger medical device company. The independent members of the Company's Board of Directors considered the potential for disruption to Hologic and its business as well as the impact on stockholder value should Mr. MacMillan leave, and determined that it was in the best interests of Hologic and its stockholders to retain him as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Accordingly, the independent members of the Board, after careful consideration and discussions with Mr. MacMillan and the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant, awarded Mr. MacMillan a $30 million special retention equity grant, effective December 1, 2017.
14       2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Proxy Statement Summary
Rather than attempt to match the sign-on bonus offered to Mr. MacMillan by the other medical device company by making a one-time cash award, the independent members of the Board chose to make an equity grant, two-thirds of which is subject to a three-year performance period (PSUs) and one third of which vests in equal installments over four years (options). If the Company does not meet the minimum ROIC and relative TSR threshold targets for the PSUs, none of the PSUs granted to Mr. MacMillan as part of this retention grant will vest. If the Company's share price does not exceed the exercise price of the options, they will have no value. Mr. MacMillan was afforded no special treatment with respect to the structure of the grants, including performance goals, which are identical to those set for the fiscal 2018 annual grants awarded to senior executives. This grant serves the dual purpose of retaining Mr. MacMillan and continuing to incentivize performance. For additional information regarding this special retention equity grant, please see the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Message from the Compensation Committee", beginning on page 40.
A Unique Asset – Investment Analysts Agree
The day after our post-market close announcement of Mr. MacMillan's special retention equity grant, the response from stockholders and investment analysts was overwhelmingly positive. In the words of several analysts:
"We believe the possibility of CEO MacMillan leaving has been an overhang on the stock and we would expect HOLX shares to be up on this news. . . The Board believed (appropriately in our view) it was in the best interest of HOLX shareholders after considering the disruption to HOLX and the business should he leave to issue a retention package. . ."
"We view the retention of Mr. MacMillan as positive for HOLX as he has been a key architect behind the company's turnaround. Since he joined the firm in December 2013, the stock has returned ~75%, outperforming the S&P by ~30%. Quarterly earnings results and sales growth have stabilized during his tenure . . . in our opinion this news underscores the difficulty of hiring talented managers in the medtech space."
" . . .faith in the execution capabilities of the HOLX management team (many personally recruited by the CEO) is a material component of our and others' investment theses in HOLX. A leadership change would have been disruptive."

PROPOSAL NO. 1 - ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Eight directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting. Our Board of Directors (referred to herein as the "Board"), upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, has nominated the individuals listed below for election as directors. All of the director nominees, other than Dr. Hantson, were previously elected by our stockholders. While the Board has recruited members based on personal recommendations in the past, in 2018, the Board used a professional search firm to identify potential directors. They reviewed a number of qualified candidates and, after considering his qualifications and conducting personal interviews, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee unanimously recommended that Dr. Hantson be appointed to the Board. In November 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously appointed him to the Board.
Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them for the Board's nominees named below. In the event that any nominee is unable or declines to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for the nominee, if any, who shall be designated by the present Board to fill the vacancy. Each nominee has consented to serving as a director if elected. The proposed nominees are being nominated in accordance with the provisions of our Bylaws. The term of office of each person elected as a director will continue until the next Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until a successor has been elected and qualified.
Vote Required
Under our Bylaws, a nominee will be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast "for" the nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" the nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on this proposal.
Recommendation of the Board
Our Board of Directors
Composition, Assessment and Qualifications
Understanding the importance of its responsibility to provide effective oversight, our Board strives to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure, diversity, skills and experience on the Board. In evaluating potential candidates for director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the entirety of each candidate's credentials, including: character and integrity, business acumen, experience, commitment and diligence. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers diversity as one of a number of factors in identifying nominees for director. It does not, however, have a formal policy in this regard. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee views diversity broadly to include diversity of experience, skills and viewpoint, as well as diversity of gender and race. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that the backgrounds and qualifications of the directors considered as a whole should provide a significant breadth of experience, knowledge and abilities to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities. Generally, directors should be individuals who have succeeded in their particular fields and who demonstrate integrity, reliability, knowledge of corporate affairs and collegiality. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers other relevant factors as it deems appropriate, including the current composition of the Board.
The Board has employed a variety of assessment formats, depending on the perceived needs of the Board at the time. Formats over the past few years have included a Board peer review managed by the general counsel, a facilitated discussion with the full Board, and individual Board and committee written evaluations followed by a discussion at each committee level and with the full Board. As a part of these evaluations, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as well as the www.hologic.com       19

Proposal No. 1 - Election of Directors
Board examine characteristics which they believe will augment the current skill set of the Board. In 2016, the Board identified as key skill sets: experience as a senior executive in a large, complex, global company; extensive operational and transactional experience; deep understanding of the Company's markets and/or customers; and a product background. In 2017, the Board determined that adding another director with extensive global experience would benefit the Board.
In 2017, Ms. Wendell and Mr. Dockendorff joined the Board, both of whom had been senior executives in a large, complex, global medical device company, had operational and transactional experience and an understanding of the Company's markets and customers. Ms. Wendell brings particular expertise in business development and strategy, which is key at a time when the Company is increasing its business development activity. Mr. Dockendorff brings extensive financial expertise for complex global healthcare organizations. In 2018, Mr. Nawana and Dr. Hantson joined the Board, bringing with them a strong global perspective and executive leadership experience.
Role of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
As provided in its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify and evaluate director candidates and may rely on input provided by a number of sources, including the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members, our other directors or officers, our stockholders, and third parties such as professional search and screening firms.
Stockholder Recommendations
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider stockholder recommendations for candidates for the Board using the criteria described in the preceding paragraphs. The name of any recommended candidate for director, together with a brief biographical sketch, a document indicating the candidate's willingness to serve, if elected, and evidence of the nominating stockholder's ownership of the Company's stock should be sent to the attention of our Corporate Secretary, Hologic, Inc., 250 Campus Drive, Marlborough, MA 01752. If you wish to formally nominate a candidate, you must follow the procedures described in Section 1.4 of our Bylaws.

Our Board's Role and Responsibilities
Overview
The Board, on behalf of the Company and its stockholders, oversees the management of the Company. While the Company's senior officers, under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer, are responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Company, implementation of the strategic, financial and management policies of the Company, and preparation of financial statements and other reports that accurately reflect requisite information about the Company, the Board oversees these activities. Taking an active role in the Company's strategic direction, the Board continually educates itself on the Company's products, markets, customers, competition and culture. The Board assesses risk, evaluates management's performance, plans for successors and provides overall guidance and direction to the Company.
Governance of the Company
Hologic's governance responsibilities are built on a foundation of interactive dialogue with stockholders, written principles and continuous improvement, which we believe will help us sustain our success, build trust in the Company and continue to create long-term stockholder value. To that end, the Company has in place Corporate Governance Guidelines which are designed to assist the Company and the Board in implementing effective corporate governance practices. The Board has also adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors and a Code of Ethics that applies specifically to senior financial officers (included as Appendix A to our Code of Conduct). These policies are publicly available on our website at investors.hologic.com. Hologic posts additional information on our website from time to time as the Board makes changes to our corporate governance practices.
Our Board believes that good governance requires not only an effective set of specific practices, but also a culture of responsibility and accountability throughout the organization. Governance at Hologic is intended to achieve both. Good governance ultimately depends on the quality of an organization's leadership, and our Board is committed to recruiting and retaining directors and officers with proven leadership ability and personal integrity.
The Board has implemented corporate governance practices that it believes are both in the best interests of Hologic and our stockholders as well as compliant with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of NASDAQ. The Board reviews these practices on an ongoing basis.
Risk Oversight
Our Board is responsible for risk oversight. A fundamental part of risk oversight is understanding the risks that we face, the steps management is taking to manage those risks, and assessing our appetite for risk. Risk management systems, including our internal auditing procedures, internal control over financial reporting and corporate compliance programs, are designed in part to inform management about our material risks. It is management's responsibility to manage risk and bring to the Board's attention material risks facing the Company. Our Board receives regular reports from management on matters relating to strategic and operational initiatives, financial performance and legal developments, including the related enterprise-risk exposures. The involvement of the Board in the oversight of our strategic planning process is a key part of its assessment of the risks inherent in our corporate strategy. Our general counsel and corporate secretary lead the Company's enterprise risk management process. As part of this process, risk is assessed throughout the business over a three-year horizon, focusing on financial risk, legal/compliance risk and operational/strategic risk. The resulting enterprise risk management report ("ERM report") details the Company's top 10 risks, as well as mitigating actions and plans relating to those risks. The ERM report includes a rolling three-year evaluation period reflecting mitigation activity progress and risk rating changes and is presented to and discussed with the Board each year. Underscoring the Board's and management's focus on enterprise risk are the individual performance objectives of the executive leadership team for fiscal 2019, which are again aligned with the Company's top enterprise risks, as identified in the ERM report.
While the Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, each of the three standing committees of the Board regularly assesses risk in connection with executing their responsibilities. In particular, the Audit and Finance Committee focuses on financial risk, including internal controls, and receives an annual risk assessment report from the Company's internal auditors. At the Compensation Committee's direction, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant conducts a risk assessment of our executive compensation programs, and members of our internal legal, human resources and sales operations departments evaluate our other compensation programs. The Compensation Committee and its independent compensation consultant reviewed and discussed these assessments for fiscal 2018, and the Compensation Committee concurred with the assessment that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business.

Succession Planning
The Board is responsible for overseeing management and planning for management successors. Succession planning starts with Mr. MacMillan, his team and the Compensation Committee, but is continued with the full Board. The Board devotes significant time on its agenda to succession planning, reviewing and discussing the succession plans for the CEO and each of his direct reports. Following Mr. MacMillan's potential departure in November 2017, the Board and Mr. MacMillan intensified their focus on succession planning. Mr. MacMillan provides a talent update at every Board and Compensation Committee meeting and the Board reviews in-depth succession plans at least annually. The Board also has exposure to succession candidates through their periodic participation in Board meetings and/or engagement outside of Board meetings.
Stockholder Engagement
While the Board, through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, oversees stockholder matters and participates in meetings with stockholders, as appropriate, management has the principal responsibility for stockholder communications and engagement. As discussed below, management provides regular feedback to the Board concerning stockholder feedback.
During 2018, we continued the year-round approach to stockholder engagement we implemented in 2015. In addition to discussions just before our Annual Meeting, we initiated discussions during a quieter period several months later, reaching out to a number of our largest stockholders, approximately 62% of our outstanding shares. This year, our Lead Independent Director participated in a number of the meetings.
YEAR-ROUND STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
[BEGIN TABLE]
 SPRING/WINTER  SUMMER/FALL 
[END TABLE]
In addition to input on current governance and executive compensation topics specific to Hologic, we invite discussion on any other topics or trends stockholders may wish to share with us. We believe that positive, two-way dialogue builds informed relationships that promote transparency and accountability. Management provides written and oral updates on the discussions with stockholders to our Lead Independent Director, Chairman, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in turn allocates specific issues to relevant Board committees for further consideration. Each Board committee reviews relevant feedback and determines if additional discussion and actions are necessary by the respective committee or full Board. The Board considers shareholder perspectives, as well as the interests of all stakeholders, when overseeing company strategy, formulating governance practices and designing compensation programs.
Stockholder Communications with the Directors
In general, any stockholder communication directed to our Board or one of its committees will be delivered to our Board or the appropriate committee. However, the Company reserves the right not to forward to our Board any abusive, threatening or otherwise inappropriate materials. Stockholders may contact our Board and committees thereof by writing to them in care of Corporate Secretary, Hologic, Inc., 250 Campus Drive, Marlborough, MA 01752.
Board Leadership Structure
Chairman and Lead Independent Director Roles
Our Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines permit the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to be filled by the same or different individuals. This allows the Board flexibility to determine whether the two roles should be combined or separated based upon our needs and the Board's assessment of its leadership from time to time. The Board and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee review the structure of the Board and Hologic leadership as part of the succession planning process on an ongoing basis. The Board also reviews its structure during its annual self-assessment.
 www.hologic.com       27
Table of Contents
Proposal No. 1 - Election of Directors
The Board believes that Hologic and its stockholders are best served at this time by having our CEO, Stephen P. MacMillan, also serve as our Chairman, and Sally W. Crawford, an independent director, serve as our Lead Independent Director. Combining the roles of Chairman and CEO makes clear that we have a single leader who is directly accountable to the Board and, through the Board, to our stockholders. It establishes one voice who speaks for the Company to customers, employees, stockholders and other stakeholders. This structure reinforces Mr. MacMillan's overall responsibility for the Company's business and strategy, under the oversight and subject to the review of the Board. It strengthens the Board and the Board's decision-making process because Mr. MacMillan, who has first-hand knowledge of our operations and the major issues facing Hologic, chairs the Board meetings where the Board discusses strategic and business issues. The combined roles facilitate a Board process that is able to identify and respond to challenges and opportunities in a more timely and efficient manner than a non-executive chairman structure would provide. This structure also enables Mr. MacMillan to act as the key link between the Board and other members of management and facilitate an efficient Board process.
The Board recognizes the importance of having a strong independent Board leadership structure to ensure accountability. Accordingly, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the Chairman is not an independent director, then the independent directors will select a Lead Independent Director. The Board believes that a Lead Independent Director is an integral part of our Board structure and facilitates the effective performance of the Board in its role of providing governance and oversight. In December 2017, the Board appointed Sally W. Crawford to serve as Lead Independent Director.
Mr. MacMillan's responsibilities as Chairman of the Board are also set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and include:
In addition to discharging the specific responsibilities identified above, Mr. MacMillan consults with Ms. Crawford on a variety of matters, including governance and strategy. As Lead Independent Director and Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Ms. Crawford takes the lead in Board structure and composition. In addition, Ms. Crawford's ability to assert independent leadership while working collaboratively with other directors, particularly evident when she served as chair of the Compensation Committee, as well as her diligence and preparedness, enable her to serve effectively as our Lead Independent Director and as Chair of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. During 2018, the Board again

Proposal No. 1 - Election of Directors considered and affirmed the current efficacy of the Lead Independent Director and combined Chairman/CEO structure for the Company. We have also discussed this structure with a number of our largest stockholders. While several advised that they do scrutinize combined Chair/CEO structures as a matter of practice, none expressed concern over this structure for Hologic.
Independent Directors and Committees
In evaluating its leadership structure, the Board also considered that, other than Mr. MacMillan, all of our directors are independent. Our independent directors appropriately challenge management and demonstrate independent judgment in making important decisions for our Company. In addition, each of the Board's standing committees – Audit and Finance, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance – is composed entirely of independent directors. As a result, oversight of key matters, such as the integrity of Hologic's financial statements, executive compensation, the nomination of directors and evaluation of the Board and its committees, is entrusted to independent directors.
Executive Sessions
The Board meets in executive session without the CEO in connection with each regularly-scheduled Board meeting as well as any other times it deems appropriate. The active involvement of the independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant responsibilities of our Lead Independent Director, promote strong, independent oversight of Hologic's management and affairs.
Board Committees
The standing committees of the Board currently are the Audit and Finance Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Board has adopted a charter for each of the three standing committees that addresses the make-up and functioning of such committee. The charters for each of the three standing committees are publicly available on our website at investors.hologic.com.
The Board is composed of a majority of "independent" directors, and all of the committees are composed entirely of "independent" directors, as such term is defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ. The Board has determined that the following current directors are "independent," according to the above definition: Sally W. Crawford, Charles J. Dockendorff, Scott T. Garrett, Namal Nawana, Christiana Stamoulis, Amy M. Wendell and Ludwig N. Hantson. Our former directors, Lawrence Levy and Elaine Ullian, were also determined to be independent while serving as members of our Board during the beginning of fiscal 2018. Mr. MacMillan is not considered independent because he is an active officer of the Company. In addition, both the Audit and Finance Committee and the Compensation Committee are composed entirely of "independent" directors as such term is defined in Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
The current membership of each committee is listed below.

Director Orientation and Continuing Education
When a new director joins the Board, or just before joining (assuming entry into a confidentiality agreement), he or she is provided with a Business Briefing Book, which gives an overview of the Company, its products, its markets, its strategy and its risks. Materials in the book generally include our current strategic plan, a description of our divisions and products, our current product pipeline, the most recent enterprise risk management report, current budget, market dynamics study, biographies for the senior management team, investment analyst reports and the like. Once elected to the Board, the new director generally has the opportunity to have individual meetings with members of the senior management team. They also receive a Governance Handbook, which includes general Board information, Board committee charters, the Company's charter and Bylaws and all of the Company's governance policies. Directors also have opportunities for continuing education, including access to third-party programs as well as regular presentations at Board meetings.
Meetings of the Board and its Committees
The Board met 13 times during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 and each of our directors attended over 90% of the total number of meetings of the Board and all committees of the Board on which he or she served. During fiscal 2018, the independent directors of the Board met in executive session during each of the Board's regular quarterly meetings and at such other Board and committee meetings as the independent directors elected.
Attendance by Directors at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders
Our Board has scheduled a Board meeting in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our directors are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on March 7, 2019. Last year, all of our directors who were nominated for election attended the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on March 14, 2018.

Code of Ethics
Pursuant to Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers that applies to our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, and other persons performing similar functions. The Company's Code of Conduct applies to all directors, officers and employees. The Company requires all of its directors, officers and employees to adhere to this code in addressing legal and ethical issues that they encounter in the course of doing their work. This code requires our directors, officers, and employees to avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all laws and regulations, conduct business in an honest and ethical manner and otherwise act with integrity and in the Company's best interest. All newly hired employees are required to certify that they have reviewed and understand this code. Our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers is publicly available on our website at investors.hologic.com as Appendix A to our Code of Conduct. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Current Report on Form 8-K regarding an amendment to, or waiver from, a provision of this code by posting such information on our website, at the address specified above.
Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions
Policies and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons. As provided in the charter of our Audit and Finance Committee, the Audit and Finance Committee reviews and approves related-party transactions (unless such review and approval has been delegated to another committee consisting solely of disinterested independent directors). The non-exclusivity of this delegation provides the Board with flexibility to address the particular circumstances of any related-party transaction. For example, certain related-party transactions involving compensation are approved by the Compensation Committee. Additionally, if one or more members of the Audit and Finance Committee are otherwise conflicted, or for any other reason, the Board reserves the right to establish a separate committee of disinterested independent directors to review a particular transaction. Regardless of the deliberative body of disinterested independent directors reviewing a related-party transaction, the standard applied in reviewing such transaction is whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable to the Company than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances. The Board generally considers related-party transactions to be those transactions that are required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K.
Director Compensation
Compensation Structure
The Board of Directors has a compensation structure consisting of a cash retainer, an annual equity award and, for some positions, a supplemental cash retainer, as described below. For fiscal 2018, the cash retainer was $70,000, the annual equity award value was $185,000, and our Lead Independent Director received a supplemental annual equity grant valued at $60,000.
BENCHMARKING
The Compensation Committee, in conjunction with the Board of Directors, periodically reviews compensation paid to non-employee directors and makes recommendations for adjustments, as appropriate. In December 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board approved, the following changes to take effect in the second quarter of fiscal 2019:
These compensation changes were recommended by and reviewed with the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant and place the Board's compensation solidly in the market median.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 - NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the provisions of Section 14A of the Exchange Act, require that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. Our Board has determined to provide our stockholders this opportunity on an annual basis.
As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the "CD&A"), our executive compensation philosophy is to provide appropriate competitive compensation opportunities to our executives with actual pay outcomes heavily influenced by the achievement of Company performance targets and individual performance objectives (in other words, "pay for performance") in support of our business strategy and creation of long-term stockholder value.
The Company's management team has been embracing a performance culture and driving growth of the business. We finished fiscal 2018 with solid performance, but also strengthened our future. Our largest businesses gained momentum in the second half of the year, likely due in large part to changes in leadership structure. At the end of fiscal 2017, Mr. MacMillan re-evaluated the Company's leadership structure, eliminating the position of Chief Operating Officer and expanding his leadership team. These changes give Mr. MacMillan direct access to commercial leadership and help to drive urgency in commercial execution as well as in business development.
Each year, we take into account the result of the "say-on-pay" vote cast by our stockholders. During the tenure of our current management team, we have seen our say-on-pay vote approval increase from 34% at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to 95% at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our say-on-pay vote approval was 74%, a decrease from the prior year. The only significant changes to our annual compensation program from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 were the addition of relative TSR as a PSU performance measure and the amendment of our CEO's Employment Agreement to add adjusted net income as a check on adjusted EPS for determination of the value of his annual long-term incentive grant, both of which are stockholder-friendly changes. We believe the decrease in say-on-pay approval was related to the special CEO retention equity grant as well as a negative say-on-pay vote recommendation from one proxy advisory firm, which did not appear to take into account the unique nature of the situation surrounding the grant. Please see the "Message from the Compensation Committee" and "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 40 for additional information.
Our Compensation Committee continually evaluates the design and direction of our compensation structure. Previously, in response to stockholder feedback, we introduced performance stock units ("PSUs") tied to return on invested capital ("ROIC") as a significant component of long-term equity awards. After careful consideration, effective for fiscal 2017 long-term equity awards, the Compensation Committee determined to add relative total shareholder return ("TSR") as an additional performance metric applicable to the PSUs. In our discussions with stockholders in connection with last year's Annual Meeting, as well as our continued stockholder outreach later in the year, there was strong support for this structure. Stockholders expressed appreciation for the considered, balanced approach in utilizing one consistent absolute metric (ROIC) and one relative metric (TSR) for PSUs, and also were strongly in favor of keeping ROIC as a performance metric.
Stockholders are urged to read our CD&A, beginning on page 42, and the section entitled "Executive Compensation Tables" beginning on page 66 for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal 2018 compensation of our NEOs.

Proposal No. 2 - Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our NEO compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to express your views on our NEOs' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific element of our compensation programs, but rather to address our overall approach to the compensation of our NEOs described in this proxy statement.

Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company, the Compensation Committee or our Board. However, the Company values the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this proposal and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation programs.
Vote Required
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on this proposal at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" will not have any effect on the proposal to approve executive compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement.

MESSAGE FROM THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
Dear Fellow Stockholders:
As a Compensation Committee, we are committed to overseeing the design and implementation of executive compensation programs that align with the interests of our stockholders and adhere to our pay-for-performance philosophy, while allowing us the flexibility to attract, retain and incentivize executives to execute Hologic's long-term strategy.
Stockholder Approval. We have made significant progress in our compensation programs over the last several years – as the Company has evolved, so have our programs. Much of the evolution was in response to feedback from stockholders – and stockholder support for our executive compensation programs has increased significantly, with our say-on-pay approval improving from 34% at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to 95% at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our say-on-pay vote approval was 74%, a decrease from the prior year. We believe this decrease was related to the one-time $30 million equity retention grant made to our CEO in the fall of 2017, and we'd like to address this grant.
Special Equity Retention Grant. While this grant is significant and certainly puts Mr. MacMillan's total compensation for fiscal 2018 well in excess of peer compensation, the independent members of the Board of Directors determined, after careful consideration and debate, that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to retain Mr. MacMillan – and that this equity grant, which is 100% performance-based, was the best way to do so. This decision was not made lightly.
To understand how the independent members of the Board came to this conclusion, it helps to have context, including understanding the role that Mr. MacMillan has played, and continues to play, in the Company's journey in building a sustainable growth company. The appointment of Mr. MacMillan as Hologic's CEO in fiscal 2014 is a critical part of our current success story. Since joining Hologic, Mr. MacMillan has led a dramatic turnaround, returning the business to growth and winning the support of Carl Icahn and other activists. Not only did he personally recruit the Company's four Division Presidents and other senior executives, but he is one of the 25 largest stockholders of the Company, when taking into account his vested but deferred equity. His interests are very much aligned with those of our stockholders, and we believe he is critical to the Company's long-term success. His leadership and vision are at the core of our significantly improved performance, and we believe it is his continued commitment to driving sustainable long-term growth and investing in our people, infrastructure and products that will drive our success as we move into the future.
In light of his long track record of success, other larger medical device and healthcare companies have expressed interest over time in hiring Mr. MacMillan to serve as Chief Executive Officer. In October 2017, Mr. MacMillan received such an offer from a larger medical device company. The independent members of the Company's Board of Directors considered the potential for disruption to Hologic and its business as well as the impact on stockholder value should Mr. MacMillan leave, and determined that it was in the best interests of Hologic and its stockholders to retain him as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Accordingly, the independent members of the Board, after careful consideration and discussions with Mr. MacMillan and the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant, awarded Mr. MacMillan a $30 million special retention equity grant, effective December 1, 2017, all of which is performance-based and on the same terms as the Company's annual equity grants for other executives for fiscal 2018. Mr. MacMillan formally declined the other more substantial offer and reaffirmed his commitment to Hologic, continuing to serve as Hologic's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.
To realize any value from the special retention equity grant, the Company – and Mr. MacMillan – must perform. If the Company does not meet the minimum ROIC and relative TSR threshold targets for the performance stock units (PSUs), none of the PSUs granted to Mr. MacMillan as part of this retention grant will vest. If the Company's share price does not exceed the exercise price of the options, they will have no value. Of note, during the month between the grant approval date (November 1, 2017) and the grant effective date (December 1, 2017), the Company's stock price increased 6.9%, reflecting in part the market's support for the grant and resulting in an effective option price premium due to the higher exercise price.
The Board believes that the special retention equity grant to Mr. MacMillan was appropriate in light of the potential for business disruption and decrease in stockholder value were Mr. MacMillan to accept the offer of employment elsewhere and leave the Company. See "Say-on-Pay and Stockholder Feedback" in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for information regarding the positive reception the grant received from stockholders and investment analysts.

Message from the Compensation Committee
Fiscal 2018 and beyond. We should note that this special retention equity grant is a one-time event, and we don't envision making any further special retention grants to Mr. MacMillan. We should also note that, when setting his compensation for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, we did not take the special retention equity grant into consideration. Mr. MacMillan's compensation generally is set in accordance with the terms of his Employment Agreement, with the exception of awards under the Short-Term Incentive Plan (STIP). For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee exercised negative discretion when setting the overall funding of the STIP at 100% and also approved funding Mr. MacMillan's STIP award at 90%. The funding of Mr. MacMillan's STIP award below 100% was due primarily to the disappointing performance of the Medical Aesthetics business in 2018, although we do recognize that all of the other businesses significantly improved and strengthened over the course of the year.
While fiscal 2017 was an overtly transformative year, with the divestiture of our blood screening business and the acquisition of Cynosure, which is our Medical Aesthetics business, fiscal 2018 has also been a transformative year, albeit a less obvious one. We touch on performance highlights in the CD&A, including the continued strength of our Breast Health and International businesses as well as acceleration of growth in our molecular diagnostics business and the stabilization of our U.S. Surgical business. The Company also ramped up business development activities, completing three tuck-in acquisitions during or just after the end of fiscal 2018. But what you may not realize is that a restructuring of the executive leadership team is helping drive the momentum in financial results and business development activity.
Leadership restructure. At the end of fiscal 2017, Mr. MacMillan re-evaluated the Company's management structure and eliminated the position of Chief Operating Officer. This change brings Mr. MacMillan closer to the businesses – fostering more transparency and accountability, with Division Presidents reporting directly to him and a broader range of business development opportunities coming to him more quickly. Mr. MacMillan also expanded his executive leadership team, forming the Global Leadership Team (GLT). This expanded group gives more leaders direct access to Mr. MacMillan and Mr. MacMillan direct access to more leaders. He also assumed responsibility from the Chief Operating Officer to conduct business reviews and leads quarterly business reviews with each division, which include members of the GLT along with the leadership team for the applicable division.
Succession Planning. Following Mr. MacMillan's potential departure in November 2017, the Board and Mr. MacMillan intensified their focus on succession planning. Succession planning starts with Mr. MacMillan, his team and the Compensation Committee, but is continued with the full Board. The Board devotes significant time on its agenda to succession planning, reviewing and discussing the succession plans for the CEO and each of his direct reports. With the departure of Bob McMahon, the Company's former CFO, this summer, such succession planning became more evident. Karleen Oberton, our current CFO, joined the GLT last fall, when she was the Corporate Vice President, Finance and Accounting, Chief Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller. Her participation on the GLT gave her additional exposure to Mr. MacMillan and other members of the leadership team. This helped Mr. MacMillan and the Board feel confident in the succession plan in place and enabled a smooth transition for Ms. Oberton as she assumed the role of CFO - another benefit of Mr. MacMillan's leadership restructure.
Mr. MacMillan has a fundamental belief that people matter. We couldn't agree more. There were a few bumps along the road in fiscal 2018, but we continue to be excited about Hologic, its people and the progress it is making in achieving its strategic vision, with Mr. MacMillan leading the charge. At the same time, we are committed to doing all that we can to ensure that we have the compensation programs in place to drive long-term stockholder value. Please do let us know if you have any questions, concerns or feedback regarding Mr. MacMillan's special retention equity grant or our compensation programs in general. We thank you for your investment in Hologic and your continued support!
Respectfully,
The Compensation Committee www.hologic.com       41

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section (CD&A), we describe the executive compensation program for our CEO and CFO, our three other most highly compensated executive officers serving as of September 29, 2018, and our former CFO (collectively, our named executive officers, or NEOs). We also explain how the Compensation Committee determined the pay of our NEOs and its rationale for specific decisions related to fiscal 2018 compensation. As a reminder, our fiscal year generally ends on the last Saturday in September. Fiscal 2018 began on October 1, 2017 and ended on September 29, 2018.
Our Named Executive Officers for Fiscal 2018
Executive Summary
2018 Business Strategy & Performance Highlights
Fiscal 2018 was a solid year for Hologic both strategically and operationally. Although the year got off to a rocky start with weaknesses in a number of our U.S. businesses, we finished the year on a very different trajectory, with our major domestic franchises performing well. We also built a sustainable growth engine internationally, launched several key new products, and acquired two companies, plus another just after fiscal year end. Although our share price lagged our peers' over the last 12 months, we believe we are a much healthier company today than a year ago, and that each of our major businesses is stronger.
In our largest division, Breast Health, domestic growth improved in each quarter of 2018, driven by strong commercial execution, market share gains for our clinically differentiated Genius 3D mammograms, and important new products. These include our state-of-the-art 3Dimensions mammography system, which we believe is the fastest, highest resolution breast tomosynthesis system on the market, and the innovative Brevera biopsy system, which streamlines biopsy procedures for an optimal patient and physician experience.
In Diagnostics, we generated solid growth by placing more of our fully automated Panther and Panther Fusion molecular diagnostics systems, launching more women's health, virology and respiratory tests to drive revenue and system utilization, and solidifying our relationships with our largest customers. In addition, our ThinPrep Pap cervical cancer test remains the leader in the U.S. liquid cytology market.
In Surgical, a revamped and more competitive sales force under new sales leadership helped quarterly results improve. Our MyoSure system for hysteroscopic tissue removal and our NovaSure product for endometrial ablation continue to lead their respective categories and improve women's lives worldwide.
In Medical Aesthetics, we posted weak revenue results, which we believe weighed on our share price. But behind the scenes, we improved our commercial capabilities and upgraded talent across the business. We also launched the innovative TempSure radiofrequency platform. Although the numbers don't show it yet, we believe we laid the foundations for a more successful 2019.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Internationally, we built a solid infrastructure for sustainable growth with new leadership, new products, and new capabilities. We also acquired Emsor, the distributor of our Breast and Skeletal Health products in Spain and Portugal. Total international revenue of $800 million grew 17.0% on a reported GAAP basis, and 12.9% in constant currency, and we have tremendous runway ahead for future growth.
Based on all these activities, we posted solid revenue growth in fiscal 2018. We generated GAAP revenue of $3,218 million, up 5.2% versus 2017, or 4.3% on a constant currency basis.
And finally, as we eliminated all the convertible debt from our balance sheet, we simultaneously enhanced our business development efforts, resulting in the acquisitions of Faxitron Bioptics for $89 million and, just after fiscal year end, of Focal Therapeutics for $125 million. Faxitron and Focal will help us expand into the adjacent growth market of breast-conserving surgery and enable us to help women throughout their continuum of breast health care, from screening to treatment.
Even as we acquired several companies, our strong cash flow enabled us to buy back 7.3 million shares of our stock for $276 million. As a result, we ended the year with fewer diluted shares outstanding than a year ago.
In terms of GAAP earnings per share (EPS), we recorded a loss of ($0.40) in fiscal 2018 due to a significant goodwill impairment charge related to our acquired Cynosure business. However, excluding this write-down and other expenses and charges excluded pursuant to the calculations in our 2018 Short-Term Incentive Plan, adjusted EPS increased 9.9%, benefiting from U.S. tax reform.
Two of the three financial performance metrics we utilize in our compensation plans, adjusted revenue(1) and adjusted EPS(2), improved from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018. Return on invested capital (ROIC)(3) was flat at 12.6%.
We overcame several challenges in fiscal 2018 to post good results, and believe we are entering 2019 with improved momentum both strategically and operationally.
OUR JOURNEY TO SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
Financial results for one year are a snapshot of short-term performance. Our focus is on the long term. Since Mr. MacMillan joined the Company in 2013, the Company has invested significantly in its people, infrastructure and products. The power of focused, motivated people is evident, and has driven growth in annual revenue and profits, among other things.

Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Highlights
In establishing the executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, the Committee continued to focus on pay for performance and competitive pay, with a focus on total direct compensation.
EMPHASIS ON PERFORMANCE-BASED TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION
The components of Total Direct Compensation (TDC) are Base Salary, Short-Term Incentives, Long-Term Incentives and Deferred Compensation Awards.
The charts below, which show the TDC of our CEO and our other NEOs for fiscal 2018, illustrate that a majority of NEO TDC is performance based (91.5% for our CEO and an average of 76.1% for our other NEOs). These charts exclude the value of other benefits and perquisites and, for Mr. MacMillan, exclude his special retention and matching equity grants, as those were not considered when setting his annual compensation.
2018 ANNUAL TARGET CEO PAY ($ in millions)
2018 ANNUAL TARGET AVERAGE NEO PAY ($ in millions)
PERFORMANCE MEASURES LINK TO STRATEGY
In setting performance measures for the incentive compensation plans, the Committee first considers the Company's strategy, contemplating the Company's long- and short-term goals and how those goals are measured.
As the Company has been focused on growth as well as efficient use of capital and creating value for stockholders, the Committee determined that using the measures of adjusted revenue, adjusted EPS and ROIC were appropriate for the incentive compensation plans. These are all non-GAAP measures that are used by management to facilitate its operational decision-making and provide key insights into the Company and management's achievements. Additionally, the use of ROIC was specifically supported in discussions with stockholders. The Company added the measure of relative TSR in fiscal 2017 to provide an external performance measure and also link executive compensation directly to the creation of stockholder value.
BALANCED APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
The Committee takes a balanced approach to long-term incentives, and, for fiscal 2018 annual grants:

PAY-FOR-PERFORMANCE ALIGNMENT
CEO SPECIAL PERFORMANCE-BASED RETENTION EQUITY GRANT
In early fiscal 2018, Mr. MacMillan received a significant offer from a large medical device company. The independent members of the Board of Directors determined, after careful consideration and debate, that it was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to retain Mr. MacMillan. Rather than attempt to match the sign-on bonus offered to Mr. MacMillan by the other medical device company by making a one-time cash award, the independent members of the Board of Directors approved a special, one-time retention equity grant to Mr. MacMillan, all of which is performance-based. The grant consists of:
The PSUs, which are subject to the same performance goals as all fiscal 2018 annual long-term incentive awards, cliff vest at the end of three years, provided the executive is employed and the measurement objectives are achieved. The stock options vest in four equal installments over four years. If the threshold measurement objectives are not achieved, the PSUs will not vest at all.
See the "Message from the Compensation Committee" at the beginning of this CD&A for additional details and background.
"Say-On-Pay" and Stockholder Feedback
Each year, we take into account the result of the say-on-pay vote cast by our stockholders. As our journey to sustainable growth continues, so does the evolution of our compensation program. During the tenure of our current management team, we have seen our say-on-pay vote approval increase from 34% at our 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to 95% at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our say-on-pay vote approval was 74%, a decrease from the prior year. The only significant changes to our compensation program from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 were the addition of relative TSR as a PSU performance measure and the amendment of our CEO's Employment Agreement to add adjusted net income as a check on adjusted EPS for determination of the value of his annual long-term incentive grant, both of which are stockholder-friendly changes. We believe this decrease in say-on-pay approval was related to the special CEO retention equity grant, including a negative say-on-pay recommendation from one proxy advisory firm, who did not appear to take into account the unique nature of the situation surrounding the special retention equity grant.
We have made good progress in our compensation design and view the increasingly positive support from stockholders as a continuing endorsement of our compensation program's evolving design and direction. Our Compensation Committee regularly evaluates our executive compensation structure and assesses its effectiveness to ensure the design is incenting performance that is in the best interests of the Company as well as our stockholders.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
While say-on-pay is a key indicator of stockholder feedback, we also are committed to maintaining an open dialogue with our institutional investors and stockholders throughout the year. We reach out to discuss business topics, seek feedback on our performance and address other matters of importance to our stockholders, such as executive compensation. Since our 2018 Annual Meeting, we have actively engaged with a number of our largest institutional investors specifically on governance issues, reaching out to holders of more than 60% of our outstanding shares. Through this dialogue, we received additional validation on the design of our executive compensation program as well as strong support for our senior management team, particularly Mr. MacMillan. Investors continued to be supportive of the special retention equity grant made to Mr. MacMillan, recognizing the unique nature of the situation. See below for additional information about our discussions with investors on performance metrics and Mr. MacMillan's special retention equity grant.

MR. MACMILLAN'S EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT – TERMS IMPACTING TOTAL DIRECT COMPENSATION
On September 18, 2015, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Mr. MacMillan, effective as of September 27, 2015, and, in September 2016, amended the Employment Agreement to eliminate a housing allowance and to add another metric to the LTIP grant value determination. Mr. MacMillan's Employment Agreement provides for:
Base Salary. A base salary at the initial annual rate of $1,000,000, with any future increases tied to the average employee merit pool percentage increase approved for base salaries of U.S. salaried employees.
STIP. A target bonus opportunity under the Company's STIP of no less than 150% of his annual base salary.
DCP. Continued contribution by the Company to the DCP on behalf of Mr. MacMillan in fiscal 2016 and each fiscal year thereafter.
LTIP. An annual equity grant under the Company's 2008 Amended and Restated Equity Incentive Plan. This LTIP grant value adjusts each year as follows: (i) for every one percent (1%) that the Company exceeds the prior fiscal year's adjusted earnings per share ("EPS") or adjusted net income, whichever is lower, the annual grant value will be increased by one-half of one percent (0.5%); and (ii) for every one percent (1%) that the Company is below prior year adjusted EPS or adjusted net income, whichever decrease is greater, the annual grant value will be reduced by one percent (1%).
The 2016 amendment to the Employment Agreement added adjusted net income as a check on adjusted EPS such that increases in annual equity grant values would be based on the lower growth of the two metrics, and decreases in annual equity grant value would be based on the larger decline of the two metrics. The Compensation Committee recommended these changes to the full Board (other than Mr. MacMillan), which approved. The Board viewed the addition of the net income metric and the use of whichever metric, adjusted net income or adjusted EPS, grows less to limit increases in the annual equity grant value and the use of whichever metric decreases more to drive decreases in annual grant value as a thoughtful and creative design in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders.
Fiscal 2018 Total Direct Compensation Elements in Detail
BASE SALARY
Base salary represents annual fixed compensation and is a standard element of compensation necessary to attract and retain talent. It is the minimum payment for a satisfactory level of individual performance as long as the executive remains employed with us. Base salary is set at the Committee's discretion after taking into account the competitive landscape including the compensation practices of the companies in our selected peer groups (and where appropriate, survey data from a broader index of comparable public companies), our business strategy, our short- and long-term performance goals and certain individual factors, such as position, salary history, individual performance and contribution, length of service with the Company and placement within the general base salary range offered to our NEOs. Mr. MacMillan's base salary is set and adjusts in accordance with the term of his Employment Agreement, as noted above.

Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The base salaries for our NEOs for fiscal 2018 were as follows:
Based on the Company's financial performance in fiscal 2017, none of the fiscal 2017 NEOs, other than Mr. Valenti, received an increase in base salary for fiscal 2018. Mr. MacMillan, who had a contractual right to a base salary increase pursuant to his Employment Agreement, specifically waived this right for fiscal 2018.
SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN HOW THE STIP WORKS
The STIP provided our NEOs the opportunity to earn a performance-based cash bonus based on the achievement of a combination of financial and non-financial corporate, divisional, and/or individual goals. Targeted payout levels are expressed as a percentage of base salary and established for each participant. An individual's bonus components are determined by such individual's title and/or role. Bonus payouts could range from 0% to 200% of targeted payout levels (e.g., the maximum bonus payout for an individual with a targeted payout level of 50% of annual base salary would be 100% of annual base salary).
The corporate financial goals under the 2018 STIP were focused on the achievement of adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS performance objectives (for definition of adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS, see Annex A). The 2018 STIP also provides for the assessment of performance based upon the achievement of individual performance objectives, which for some NEOs included divisional performance objectives, all of which were approved by the Committee.
The overall funding level of the 2018 STIP is generally determined based upon the Company's performance against the established targets. Funding of the STIP is contingent upon achieving the threshold level for at least one of the two corporate performance objectives. If neither corporate performance objective threshold is met, there is no payout under the STIP. Individual bonus awards for NEOs were calculated based upon the overall funding level, as well as the targeted payout levels and achievement of individual performance objectives.

2018 PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND RESULTS
The Committee believed the financial performance components of the 2018 STIP were achievable, but appropriately challenging, based on market climate and internal budgeting and forecasting. The following table outlines the threshold, target and maximum financial performance objectives for the 2018 STIP, as well as the results achieved:
WHY ADJUSTED REVENUE AND EPS?
ADJUSTED REVENUE. The Committee believes that organic growth, that is, revenue growth excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and acquisitions and other transactions, is an important measure of management's achievements in operating the Company's core businesses during the year. Accordingly, the Committee utilizes adjusted revenue as a performance measure in the STIP.
Adjusted revenue, which is intended to reflect organic growth, is calculated on a constant currency basis using our fiscal 2018 budget foreign currency exchange rates and, pursuant to the terms of our STIP, is also adjusted (i) to remove the effect of acquisitions or dispositions (including the discontinuance of a product or product line other than in the ordinary course of business) that are completed during the reporting period that materially affect the Company's consolidated revenue; and (ii) to exclude any acquisition-related accounting or other effects that are excluded in the calculation of adjusted EPS. Revenue that is adjusted to exclude the impact of these events is a non-GAAP measure.
For fiscal 2018, adjusted revenue was calculated on a constant currency basis, using the fiscal 2018 budgeted foreign currency exchange rates, and excludes the impact of the Emsor and Faxitron acquisitions. A reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted revenue to our GAAP revenue is provided in Annex A to this proxy statement.
ADJUSTED EPS. This metric is used by management to evaluate our historical operating results and as a comparison to competitors' operating results. The Committee agrees with this approach and uses this non-GAAP measure as a performance measure in the STIP.
HOW WE ESTABLISH ADJUSTED REVENUE AND ADJUSTED EPS GOALS

Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
2018 STIP AWARDS
For fiscal 2018, the Company exceeded the target for adjusted EPS under the STIP but missed the adjusted revenue target. Adjusted EPS was 150% of target while adjusted revenue was 75% of target. With adjusted revenue weighted 60% and adjusted EPS weighted 40%, this would result in a payout of 105%. Given the miss in revenue target and the fact that EPS was positively impacted by U.S. tax reform, management recommended that the STIP pool be funded at 100% for corporate performance. The Committee agreed with this approach, exercised negative discretion, and set the overall funding level of the 2018 STIP at 100% of target funding. Individual bonus awards for NEOs were then calculated based on this overall funding level as well as the targeted payout levels and individual performance objectives for each NEO, as discussed in more detail below.
Individual performance objectives for our NEOs reflected the top priorities for our NEOs and were aligned with the top risks identified in our annual Enterprise Risk Management process, including driving global growth, strengthening the pipeline for 2019 and beyond and succession planning and talent development. Mr. Valenti's and Mr. West's individual performance objectives also included revenue growth performance goals for, respectively, the Breast and Skeletal Health division and the Diagnostics division. Because Mr. McMahon left the Company prior to fiscal year end, he did not receive a bonus for fiscal 2018.

     Based on the Company's financial performance (funded at 100%) as well as an assessment of Mr. MacMillan's individual performance for fiscal 2018 (funded at 50%), Mr. MacMillan was awarded  a total bonus amount of $1,390,500, which represents 90% of his overall target amount.

LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVES
We believe that strong sustainable corporate performance is achieved with a culture that encourages long-term focus by our NEOs and aligns the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders. We also use our long-term awards to attract and retain critical employee talent by providing a competitive market-based opportunity. To achieve these objectives, we award long-term incentives on an annual basis in the form of equity. For fiscal 2018, we structured our annual equity incentive awards as follows:
PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS
ROIC PSUs. Half of the PSUs granted use ROIC as a metric and vest only if the Company achieves a pre-determined ROIC three-year average minimum threshold (the ROIC PSUs) at the end of a three-year performance period. If the minimum three-year average ROIC threshold is not achieved, none of the ROIC PSUs granted for that three-year performance period will vest and all will be forfeited. If the target three-year average ROIC goal is achieved, 100% of the ROIC PSUs granted will vest. The maximum payout for ROIC PSUs is limited to 200% of the target number of ROIC PSUs granted and is earned only if we achieve the maximum three-year average ROIC goal.
At the vesting date, earned PSU awards are settled in shares of Hologic common stock, unless settlement has been deferred pursuant to the Company's Deferred Equity Plan. For details about our use of ROIC as a performance measure, please see "Why ROIC and Relative TSR?" below. ROIC PSUs also are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the form of ROIC Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement.
In fiscal 2016, the Committee eliminated annual ROIC hurdles for fiscal 2016 PSU grants while retaining the more challenging three-year average ROIC minimum threshold for the performance period. The Committee viewed the annual hurdles as having the potential to penalize recipients for executing value-enhancing acquisitions but believes retaining the three-year average ROIC minimum threshold incents management to remain disciplined on value creation. For fiscal 2018 PSU grants, the Committee continued to utilize the three-year average ROIC minimum threshold for the performance period.
The following table outlines the threshold, minimum, target, 125% and maximum three-year average ROIC goals for the ROIC PSUs granted as fiscal 2018 long-term incentive awards (see "2018 Long-Term Annual Incentive Award Grants" below):
[BEGIN TABLE]
The Company achieved annual ROIC for fiscal 2018 of 12.6%. If we fail to achieve the minimum three-year average ROIC goal of 12% for the fiscal 2018-2020 performance period, none of the PSUs granted as fiscal 2018 long-term incentive awards will vest, and all will be forfeited.

TSR PSUs. The other 50% of PSUs vest based on the Company's total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder return of companies in the TSR PSU Peer Group, measured over a three-year performance period (the TSR PSUs). The fiscal 2018 TSR PSU awards vest at target and at 200% of target upon achievement of relative total shareholder return at the 50th and 95th percentile, respectively. If the Company's relative total shareholder return is below the 25th percentile, then no TSR PSUs will vest. At the vesting date, earned PSU awards are settled in shares of Hologic common stock, unless settlement has been deferred pursuant to the Company's Deferred Equity Plan. For details about our use of relative TSR as a performance measure, please see "Why ROIC and Relative TSR?" below. TSR PSUs also are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the form of TSR Performance Stock Unit Award Agreement.
WHY ROIC AND RELATIVE TSR?
ROIC. The Committee introduced ROIC as a performance metric in fiscal 2014 to hold management accountable for generating greater returns on capital allocated. Investors have been supportive of the use of ROIC. Given the significant improvement in ROIC since its introduction as a performance metric, the Committee believes it is having the intended effect.
In addition to being well-received and supported by our stockholders, the use of ROIC:
The key building blocks of our ROIC metric are: (1) adjusted net operating profit after tax (NOPAT), (2) average net debt, and (3) average stockholders' equity. ROIC is calculated as NOPAT/(average net debt + average stockholders' equity).(1) ROIC is a non-GAAP measure. See Annex A for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.
RELATIVE TSR. In addition to being well-received and supported by our stockholders, use of relative TSR:
To calculate the Company's relative TSR performance, the cumulative three-year TSR for Hologic and each of the companies in the TSR Peer group is calculated and then Hologic's discrete percentile rank is calculated. The TSR PSUs vest at target and at 200% of target upon achievement of relative TSR at the 50th and 95th percentile, respectively. If the Company's relative TSR is below the 25th percentile, no TSR PSUs will vest and all will be forfeited.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
HOW WE ESTABLISH ROIC AND RELATIVE TSR GOALS
ROIC. In setting ROIC goals for the ROIC PSUs, the Committee considered past performance as well as future opportunities for efficiencies. Although the ROIC minimum threshold of 12% did not change from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018, the fiscal 2018 grant ROIC target goal of 13% represents a 100 basis point decrease from the fiscal 2017 grant ROIC target goal of 14%. As with most things, context is important.
For fiscal 2017 ROIC PSU grants, the Committee raised the ROIC target 200 basis points from 12% to 14%, a very aggressive goal. The Committee believed the increase was warranted given the Company's performance at the time as well as future opportunities for efficiencies. When the Committee set goals for the fiscal 2018 grant, however, the Company had a very different profile than it did when the Committee set goals for the fiscal 2017 grant. During fiscal 2017, the Company divested its higher margin blood screening business and acquired the lower margin, but potentially higher growth, medical aesthetics business. When setting the target goal for the fiscal 2018 ROIC PSUs, the Committee appropriately considered these transformative events. In addition, the performance scale for 2018 ROIC PSU grants has a non-linear performance scale above target which only accelerates once ROIC of 14% is achieved. If we fail to achieve the minimum three-year average ROIC goal of 12% for the fiscal 2018-2020 performance period, none of the ROIC PSUs granted as fiscal 2018 long-term incentive awards will vest and all will be forfeited.
RELATIVE TSR. In implementing and setting the new relative TSR goals for the TSR PSUs, the Committee considered market practice as well as the Company's focus on driving stockholder value. The TSR PSUs granted as fiscal 2018 long-term incentive awards vest at target upon achievement of relative TSR at the 50th percentile of a custom TSR Peer Group. If the Company's relative TSR is below the 25th percentile, then no TSR PSUs will vest, and all will be forfeited. The Company considered utilizing the 75th percentile of TSR as the threshold for the maximum 200% payout, as many companies do, but determined to use the more challenging 95th percentile as the threshold for maximum payout.
STOCK OPTIONS
Stock options vest in four equal annual installments, becoming fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Stock options have a 10-year term, and are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the form of Stock Option Award Agreement.
RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS
RSUs vest in three equal annual installments, becoming fully vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. Only vested RSUs can be exchanged for shares of Hologic common stock. RSUs also are subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the form of Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement.
2018 LONG-TERM ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARD GRANTS
The annual long-term incentive awards granted to our NEOs in November of 2017 (fiscal 2018) as compared to awards for fiscal 2017 are as follows:

Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The 6.0% increase in the value of Mr. MacMillan's equity grant from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 is calculated in accordance with the terms of his Employment Agreement, as described above. For fiscal 2017, adjusted net income grew 12.0% and adjusted EPS grew 12.2%. As adjusted net income grew slightly less than adjusted EPS, adjusted net income is the applicable metric. Half of the 12.0% adjusted net income growth yields a 6.0% increase in grant value.
The decrease in value of the fiscal 2018 long-term incentive award grants as compared to the fiscal 2017 grants for Mr. Valenti and Mr. West was due in large part to the fact that the fiscal 2017 grant was based on excellent financial performance in fiscal 2016 and thus, the fiscal 2017 grant was larger than usual. The fiscal 2018 grant value, which is based on fiscal 2017 financial results, reflects a move back to the target grant value for division presidents. By way of comparison, the fiscal 2016 STIP funded at 125%, while the fiscal 2017 STIP funded at 100%. The long-term incentive award grant values, while not tied to the STIP, are influenced by Company financial results for the prior fiscal year.
2019 LONG-TERM ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARD GRANTS
The annual long-term incentive awards granted to our NEOs in November of 2018 (fiscal 2019) as compared to awards for fiscal 2018 are as follows:
The 2.2% decrease in the value of Mr. MacMillan's fiscal 2019 long-term incentive award annual grant value as compared to his fiscal 2018 annual grant value is calculated in accordance with the terms of his Employment Agreement, as described above. For fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017, adjusted net income decreased 2.2% and adjusted EPS increased 0.5%. Although adjusted EPS increased, because Mr. MacMillan's grant value adjusts based on the lower result, the applicable metric is adjusted net income. While Mr. MacMillan's grant value increases 0.5% for every 1% increase in the applicable metric, the value decreases 1% for every 1% decrease in the applicable metric. Accordingly, Mr. MacMillan's grant value decreased 2.2% for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018, equal to the decrease in the Company's fiscal 2018 adjusted net income.
The increase in value of Mr. Valenti's fiscal 2019 long-term incentive award grant as compared to his fiscal 2018 grant was due in large part to the performance of the Breast Health division in fiscal 2018 as well as the key role the division plays and is expected to play in the Company's growth. The increase in Mr. West's grant value is based on the performance of the Diagnostics division, particularly in the last quarter of fiscal 2018, as well as the key role the division plays and is expected to play in the Company's growth. The increase in Mr. Griffin's grant is based on his continued role as a valued advisor, as well as the additional responsibility he assumed during the year overseeing business development activities as well as for retention purposes. The significant increase in Ms. Oberton's fiscal 2019 grant value is related to her assumption of the role of CFO in August 2018. Her fiscal 2019 grant value is in-line with early grants awarded to Mr. McMahon when he was a first-time public company CFO.

VESTING OF ROIC PSUs GRANTED IN FISCAL 2015
The PSU awards granted in November 2014 (fiscal 2015) vested in November 2017 (fiscal 2018). These ROIC PSUs were subject to a three-year cliff vesting period with vesting contingent on the Company achieving an average ROIC of 11% for the three-year performance period as well as annual performance hurdles for fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 of 8.5%, 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively. If performance was below any of these levels, none of the PSUs would vest. Actual performance was 12.04% for the three-year performance period and 10.88%, 12.7% and 12.55% for fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Accordingly, these PSUs vested at 200% of target.
DEFERRED COMPENSATION DEFERRED COMPENSATION PROGRAM CONTRIBUTIONS
The Company's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the DCP) provides our NEOs with non-qualified retirement benefits in excess of what may be provided under our 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan and tax code limitations. The Committee considers the DCP Company contribution in the context of total compensation and views the contribution as a tool to help close a competitive market gap when evaluating the total value of annual compensation.
The DCP allows NEOs to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of their annual bonus to a supplemental retirement account. In addition, the Company has the ability to make annual contributions to the DCP. Each DCP contribution the Company makes on behalf of our NEOs is subject to a three-year vesting schedule, such that one-third of each contribution vests annually and each contribution is fully-vested three years after the contribution is made. In addition, Company contributions become fully vested upon: (i) death, disability or a change of control; (ii) retirement after the attainment of certain age and/or service milestones; or (iii) as otherwise provided by the Committee in its sole discretion. The DCP Company contributions granted to our NEOs in November 2018 (fiscal 2019) and November 2017 (fiscal 2018) are set forth below:
The overall funding of the Company's contributions to the DCP is based on the applicable STIP funding factor, with the amount of the Company DCP contribution to each individual based upon role/job level target values with differentiation for individual performance. Mr. Valenti received an increased DCP contribution for fiscal 2019 based on his performance in fiscal 2018, including the revenue growth in the Breast and Skeletal Health division.
DEFERRED EQUITY PLAN
The Hologic, Inc. Deferred Equity Plan, as amended (the DEP) is designed to allow executives and non-employee directors to accumulate Hologic stock in a tax-efficient manner and assist them in meeting their long-term equity accumulation goals and stock ownership guidelines. Participants may elect to defer the settlement of RSUs and PSUs granted under the Amended and Restated 2008 Equity Incentive Plan until separation from service or separation from service plus a fixed number of years. Participants may defer settlement by vesting tranche. Although the equity will vest on schedule, if deferral of settlement is elected, no shares will be issued until the settlement date. The settlement date will be the earlier of death, disability, change in control or separation from service/separation from service plus number of years elected. All of our NEOs, other than Ms. Oberton, who just became an NEO, have elected to participate in the DEP.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS
The Committee maintains retirement benefits to help the Company attract and retain the most highly talented senior executives. Over the years, the Committee has modified these programs to ensure competitive alignment with an evolving market. We believe the overall value of our retirement programs is consistent with our industry peers.
401(k) SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLAN
The Company sponsors a 401(k) Savings and Investment Plan, which is a qualified retirement plan offered to all eligible employees, including our NEOs. The Plan allows participants to elect to defer a portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis, up to the limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In 2018, which includes the first three months of the Company's fiscal 2019, the Company matched 100% of the first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of each participant's deferrals, up to an amount equal to 4% of the first $275,000 earned by a participant.
EQUITY RETIREMENT PROVISION
After considering market trends in retirement program practices as well as the needs of the Company, during fiscal 2016, the Committee approved the addition of a retirement provision to its equity compensation program. The provision, which applies solely to U.S. employees, provides for the continued vesting of RSUs and stock options and pro-rata vesting of PSUs when a person retires, if the individual is either 65 years of age or older, or at least 55 years of age with 10 years of continuous service with the Company. While RSUs and stock options continue to vest on their original vesting schedule following retirement, PSUs vest on their original vesting date on a pro-rata basis (based on number of days employed during the applicable performance period) based on actual performance during the performance period (assuming threshold performance is achieved). If threshold performance is not achieved during the applicable performance period, no PSUs will vest. This equity retirement provision is applicable to equity grants made from November 5, 2015 forward.
OTHER BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES
Our NEOs also generally participate in other benefit plans on the same terms as all of our other employees. These plans include our employee stock purchase plan, medical and dental insurance, life insurance, short- and long-term disability insurance programs, as well as customary vacation, leave of absence and other similar policies.
We also provide limited perquisites and personal benefits based on considerations unique to each NEO position. During fiscal 2018, we provided each of the NEOs with an automobile allowance. In addition, Mr. MacMillan has access to private air transportation for business purposes and limited non-entertainment personal use. The non-entertainment personal use is subject to a maximum aggregate incremental cost to the Company of $150,000 per fiscal year. The values of all perquisites and other personal benefits provided to our NEOs are included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 66.
Our Decision-Making Process
The Compensation Committee oversees the compensation and benefits programs for our NEOs. The Committee is comprised solely of independent, non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The Committee works very closely with its independent compensation consultant and management to examine the effectiveness of the Company's executive compensation program throughout the year. Details of the Committee's authority and responsibilities are specified in the Committee's charter, which may be accessed through investors.hologic.com.
THE ROLE OF THE COMMITTEE
The Committee seeks to ensure that the links between our executive compensation program and our business goals are responsible, appropriate and strongly aligned with stockholder interests. The Committee annually determines the compensation levels of our NEOs by considering several factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Each NEO's role and responsibilities 
● How the NEO is performing those responsibilities 
● Our historical and anticipated future financial performance  
● Compensation practices of the companies in our peer group(s)

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
THE ROLE OF MANAGEMENT
During fiscal 2018, Mr. MacMillan reviewed the performance and compensation of the NEOs, other than himself, and made recommendations as to their compensation to the Committee. No executive officer participates in the deliberations of the Committee regarding his or her own compensation.
THE ROLE OF THE INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT
The Committee retained Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC (Pearl Meyer) to serve as its executive compensation consultant for fiscal 2018. Pearl Meyer did not perform any services for us other than as directed by the Committee.
During fiscal 2018, Pearl Meyer advised the Committee on a variety of subjects such as compensation plan design and trends, pay for performance analytics, benchmarking norms, and other such matters. Pearl Meyer also conducted a risk assessment of our executive compensation practices for fiscal 2018, as described in "Risk Oversight" on page 26. Pearl Meyer reports directly to the Committee, participates in meetings as requested and communicates with the Committee Chair between meetings as necessary.
Prior to engaging Pearl Meyer, the Committee reviewed the firm's qualifications as well as its independence and any potential conflicts of interest. The Committee has the sole authority to modify or approve Pearl Meyer's compensation, determine the nature and scope of its services, evaluate its performance, and terminate the engagement and hire a replacement or additional consultant at any time.
PEER GROUP
The Committee compares our executive compensation program to a group of companies that are comparable in terms of size and industry (the Primary Peer Group). The overall purpose of this peer group is to provide a market frame of reference for evaluating our compensation arrangements (current or proposed), understanding compensation trends among comparable companies, and reviewing other compensation and governance-related topics that may arise during the course of the year.
For setting target compensation levels for NEOs in fiscal 2018, the Company examined the practices of the following 13 companies (as well as other relevant data):

[END TABLE]
Each year, Pearl Meyer conducts and presents to the Committee an executive compensation competitive assessment to assist the Committee in assessing whether executive target pay levels by element and in the aggregate are competitive in the marketplace. With the exception of Mr. MacMillan, the fiscal 2018 target annual TDC opportunities, comprised of base salary, target annual STIP, annual long-term incentive awards and deferred compensation contributions, were determined to be, on average, competitive with the market median. The Committee recognizes that Mr. MacMillan is a seasoned,

Compensation Discussion and Analysis accomplished CEO whose market for prospective employment opportunities includes larger organizations, as evidenced by the substantial offer he received from one such company in October 2017. As such, Mr. MacMillan's fiscal 2018 target annual TDC opportunity, which does not include his special equity retention grant, is positioned in the upper quartile of the Primary Peer Group, which the Compensation Committee believes is warranted given his value to the Company. Although the Committee does not use the Supplemental Peer Practices Group (discussed below) in setting compensation, we note that Mr. MacMillan's fiscal 2018 target annual TDC opportunity, which does not include his special equity retention grant, is in the lowest quartile of the Supplementary Practices Peer Group.
CHANGES TO THE PRIMARY PEER GROUP
Pearl Meyer reviews our Primary Peer Group annually for appropriateness based on a variety of factors including: similarities in revenue levels and size of market capitalization and enterprise value, similarities to the industries in which we operate, the overlapping labor market for top management talent, our status as a publicly traded, U.S.-based, non-subsidiary company, and various other characteristics. The Company uses enterprise value in addition to market capitalization for comparative purposes because of its capital structure.
Following each of the 2017 and the 2018 reviews by Pearl Meyer of our Primary Peer Group, the Committee changed the Primary Peer Group utilized for purposes of fiscal 2018 compensation and for fiscal 2019 compensation, respectively, as follows:

Additional Compensation Practices, Policies & Guidelines
OUR POSITION ON EMPLOYMENT, CHANGE OF CONTROL AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS
Our ability to build the exceptional leadership team in place today was due in large part to our having a full complement of compensation tools available to us and the flexibility to use them. This includes the ability to leverage employment, change of control and severance agreements.
The Committee believes that together, our employment, change of control and severance agreements, which are guided by our compensation philosophy and governance practices and policies (e.g., double-trigger change of control provisions, no tax gross-ups), are well aligned with those of our peers. More importantly, they foster stability within senior management by helping our executives maintain continued focus and dedication to their responsibilities to maximize stockholder value, including in the event of a transaction that could result in a change in control of our Company.
The Committee believes that providing change of control and severance benefits eliminates, or at least reduces, any reluctance of senior management to pursue potential change of control transactions that may be in the best interests of stockholders.
We also understand the concern of our stockholders regarding severance arrangements, and in 2015, the Committee adopted a Policy on Executive Severance Agreements. This policy limits severance benefits under any new severance or employment agreements entered into with executive officers to 2.99 times the sum of the executive officer's base salary and non-equity incentive plan payment or other annual non-equity bonus or award; any benefits in excess of this amount must be ratified by stockholders. For purposes of this policy "severance benefits" do not include the value of accelerated vesting of any outstanding equity awards or payments under the Company's retirement and deferred compensation plans. Details about the specific arrangements made with our NEOs are set forth on pages 76-78.

EXECUTIVE STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
Our Board believes that our directors and officers should hold a meaningful financial stake in the Company in order to further align their interests with those of our stockholders. Our CEO is expected to achieve equity ownership in the Company with a value of five times his then current base salary and each of our other NEOs and executive officers is expected to achieve equity ownership in the Company with a value of two times his or her then current base salary, within five years of employment or five years from the adoption of the guideline, whichever is later. Only shares of stock issued and outstanding (or vested and deferred under our deferred equity plan) are credited towards the ownership goals. All of our NEOs have achieved ownership in excess of the guideline, except for Ms. Oberton who just became subject to the ownership guidelines this year. Information about ownership guidelines for our non-employee directors can be found in the "Director Compensation" section on page 34 of this proxy statement.
INCENTIVIZED TO DRIVE STOCKHOLDER VALUE
Mr. MacMillan is invested in Hologic. Literally. Under our stock ownership guidelines, he is expected to achieve equity ownership in the Company with a value of five times his base salary. As of the end of fiscal 2018, he owned equity in the Company with a value of over 50 times his fiscal 2018 base salary. The value of these shares held by Mr. MacMillan (including shares vested but deferred, but not including any unvested equity) is over $50 million, based on the closing price per share of Hologic stock on September 28, 2018. Mr. MacMillan purchased over 15% of these shares in the open market. As evidenced by his substantial ownership of Hologic shares, Mr. MacMillan's interests are well-aligned with those of stockholders.
COMPENSATION RECOUPMENT POLICY
Under our compensation recoupment, or clawback, policy, if our Board determines that an officer engaged in fraud or willful misconduct that resulted in a restatement of the Company's financial results, then the Board may review all performance-based compensation – both cash and equity – awarded to or earned by that officer on the basis of performance during the fiscal periods materially affected by the restatement. If, in the view of our Board, the performance-based compensation would have been lower if it had been based on the restated financial results, the Board may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, seek recoupment from that officer of any portion of such performance-based compensation as it deems appropriate after a review of all relevant facts and circumstances. Any recoupment under this policy may be in addition to, and shall not otherwise limit, any other remedies that may be available to the Company under applicable law, including disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment.
TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS
The Committee considers tax and accounting implications in determining all elements of our compensation plans, programs and arrangements, although they are not the only factors considered. In some cases, other important considerations may outweigh tax or accounting considerations, and the Committee maintains the flexibility to compensate its officers in accordance with the Company's compensation philosophy.
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally limits the deductibility of compensation to $1 million per year for certain named executive officers of the Company, except that historically Section 162(m) provided for an exemption for compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation." In the past, several elements of our named executive officers' compensation were intended to be deductible under Section 162(m) as performance-based compensation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based compensation, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, but provides a transition rule with respect to remuneration that is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not materially modified after that date. As a result, we expect that, subject to certain exceptions for arrangements that were outstanding as of November 2, 2017, compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1 million generally will not be deductible.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan. Effective as of March 15, 2006, we adopted a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (the "DCP"), to provide non-qualified retirement benefits to a select group of our senior management and highly compensated employees including the NEOs. The DCP was amended and restated on each of October 15, 2011, November 5, 2013 (effective as of October 15, 2013) and September 17, 2015. The DCP is a deferred compensation plan that permits our NEOs to contribute up to 75% of their annual base salary and 100% of their annual bonus to a supplemental retirement account. In addition, the Company retains the ability to make annual discretionary contributions to the DCP on behalf of participants. Each DCP contribution the Company makes on behalf of our NEOs is subject to a three-year vesting schedule, such that one-third of each contribution vests annually and each contribution is fully-vested three years after the contribution is made. In addition, Company contributions become fully vested upon (1) death, disability or a change of control, (2) retirement after the attainment of certain age and/or service milestones, or (3) as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion. Elective contributions made by the NEOs are 100% vested.
A separate DCP account is established for each NEO and each account is credited with earnings or losses based on the performance of mutual funds selected by each participant in which the account is invested. The obligations under the DCP are our general unsecured obligations to pay money in the future. We established a rabbi trust as a source of funds which can satisfy the obligations under the DCP. An NEO has no rights to any assets held by the rabbi trust, except as general creditors. An NEO's rights to any amounts credited to his DCP account may not be alienated, sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, attached or otherwise encumbered by the NEO, but may pass upon his death pursuant to a beneficiary designation in accordance with the terms of the DCP.
DCP benefits are paid in lump sum, or at the NEO's election, in annual installments for a period of up to fifteen years. Distributions of DCP benefits will begin following the earlier of the NEO's normal retirement date or a date-certain distribution date elected by the participant. In certain instances, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), requires that distribution not be made to an NEO until six months after his separation from service. An NEO may also receive a distribution if he or she suffers an unforeseeable emergency in accordance with the Code.
Deferred Equity Plan. The Hologic, Inc. Deferred Equity Plan, as amended (the "DEP") is designed to allow executives and non-employee directors to accumulate Hologic stock in a tax-efficient manner and assist them in meeting their long-term equity accumulation goals and stock ownership guidelines. Participants may elect to defer the settlement of RSUs and PSUs granted under the Amended and Restated 2008 Equity Incentive Plan until separation from service or separation from service plus a fixed number of years. Participants may defer settlement by vesting tranche. Although the equity will vest on schedule, if deferral of settlement is elected, no shares will be issued until the settlement date. The settlement date will be the earlier of death, disability, change in control or separation from service/separation from service plus number of years elected.

In each case, receipt of any severance payments or benefits is conditioned upon Mr. MacMillan's release of all claims against the Company and its officers and directors.

In the event that Mr. MacMillan receives benefits as the result of a change of control, such benefits will be in lieu of any of the severance benefits provided for in his Employment Agreement.
Change of Control. Mr. MacMillan's Change of Control Agreement provides that in the event of a change of control during the term of the agreement, if, in anticipation of or within the three-year period following the change of control (the "Employment Period"), his employment is terminated for reasons other than death, disability or cause, or he resigns for good reason, he is entitled to certain benefits (a double-trigger arrangement). In such circumstances, he shall have the right to receive (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to his accrued and unpaid compensation through the date of his termination; (ii) a pro-rata highest annual bonus (as defined below) based on the number of days elapsed during the fiscal year through the date of termination; (iii) a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of 2.99 times the sum of his annual base salary for the fiscal year preceding the date of termination and highest annual bonus; and (iv) immediate and full vesting of all stock options, RSUs, PSUs and other equity awards, with any options (or other similar awards) remaining exercisable for the shorter of the remaining term of the award or a period of one year following the executive's termination.
The term "highest annual bonus" is defined as the greater of (i) the average of annual bonuses paid to the executive over the three fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which the change of control occurs; (ii) the annual bonus paid to the executive in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the change of control occurs; or (iii) the target bonus award opportunity associated with the Company achieving its 100 percent target payout level as determined in accordance with the Company's bonus plan for the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which the change of control occurs.

Mr. Griffin and Ms. Oberton
The Company has entered into a Severance and Change of Control Agreement with each of Mr. Griffin and Ms. Oberton. The Company had also entered into a Severance and Change of Control Agreement with Mr. McMahon on the terms described below, but due to his voluntary departure from the Company, effective August 2, 2018, this agreement is no longer in effect.
Severance. Each agreement provides that if the executive is terminated by the Company without cause or resigns for good reason, then the executive is entitled to receive certain benefits, including (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to the executive's accrued and unpaid compensation through the termination date, which includes base salary, reimbursement for reasonable and necessary business expenses and vacation pay; (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the year in which the executive was terminated; (iii) for one-year from the date of termination, continuation of the executive's previous year's salary and payment of an amount equal to the executive's average annual bonus divided by the number of payroll periods during such one-year severance period; and (iv) a one-year continuation of the executive's medical and dental benefits. The severance pay and benefits provided under the Severance and Change of Control Agreements are in lieu of any other severance or termination pay to which the executive may be entitled under any other severance or termination plans, programs or arrangements. In the event that the executive receives benefits as the result of a change of control, then the executive will receive such change of control benefits in lieu of any of the severance benefits.
Change of Control. Terms relating to benefits payable in connection with termination shortly before or within three years of a change of control are identical to those described above for Mr. MacMillan except that Mr. Griffin and Ms. Oberton shall continue to receive health and dental benefits for a period of one year following the executive's termination.

In the event any payments and benefits provided under the Severance Agreement are subject to excise taxes under Section 280G of the Code, then the payment shall be reduced so that no payment to be made or benefit to be provided to the executive shall be subject to the excise tax.

Change of Control. The Change of Control Agreement provides that in the event of a change of control and during the two-year period following the consummation of such change of control, if the executive's employment is terminated for reasons other than death, disability or cause, or if he resigns for good reason (a "double trigger" arrangement), then he shall be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to his accrued compensation through the termination date, which includes base salary, reimbursement for reasonable and necessary business expenses and vacation pay; (ii) a prorated average annual bonus for the year in which he was terminated; (iii) a lump sum payment equal to the sum of his annual base salary and average annual bonus; (iv) immediate and full vesting of all stock options, RSUs, PSUs and other equity awards; and (v) continued health and dental benefits for a period of one year following termination.
The amount of the estimated payments and benefits payable to NEOs, assuming a change of control of the Company as of the last day of fiscal 2018, is shown in the table above under the heading "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control."
Pay Ratio
Our philosophy is to pay our employees competitively compared to similar positions in the applicable labor market. We follow that approach worldwide, whether for an executive position or an hourly job at a local facility. We take into account location, job level, time with us and time in current role, experience and skill set, and adjust compensation annually to match the applicable market. By doing so, we believe we maintain a high-quality, stable workforce.
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to calculate and disclose the total compensation paid to our median employee, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to the median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to our CEO.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the annual total compensation of the employee identified at median of our company (other than our CEO), was $87,845; 
● the annual total compensation of our CEO, excluding his special retention equity grant, was $12,040,142; and 
● the annual total compensation of our CEO, including his special retention equity grant, was $42,040,142. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees (other than our CEO) was estimated to be approximately 137 to 1 when excluding the special retention equity grant and 478 to 1 when including the special retention equity grant.
The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. The SEC rules for identifying the "median employee" and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by us, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.
To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, we utilized annual base salary as of August 1, 2018 and fiscal 2018 bonuses/commissions for all employees employed on August 1, 2018. We included all employees on our payroll and did not exclude any countries. We calculated the compensation of the median employee, once identified, in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2) of Regulation S-K.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 - RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The Audit and Finance Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young"), an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2019, and the Board is asking stockholders to ratify that selection. Although current law, rules, and regulations, as well as the charter of the Audit and Finance Committee, require the Audit and Finance Committee to engage, retain, and supervise the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Board considers the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to be an important matter of stockholder concern and is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young for ratification by stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice.
Ernst & Young has continuously served as our independent registered public accounting firm since June 24, 2002. A representative of Ernst & Young will be available during the meeting to make a statement if such representative desires to do so and to respond to appropriate questions.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on this proposal at the Annual Meeting is required to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" will not have any effect on the proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Ernst & Young, the Audit and Finance Committee will review the Company's relationship with Ernst & Young and take such action as it deems appropriate, which may include continuing to retain Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.

The fiscal 2018 audit fees included incremental amounts related to the inclusion of Cynosure in the full audit period and subject to additional procedures related to auditing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, fiscal 2018 audit fees include amounts to audit the impact of tax reform, the issuance of multiple comfort letters and related accounting for debt financings and procedures related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. The fiscal 2017 fees also include amounts to audit purchase accounting for our Cynosure acquisition as well as incremental year-end audit procedures related to this acquisition.
Audit-Related Fees.

The fees in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 were for due diligence services.
Tax Fees. Consists of aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. In fiscal 2018 and 2017, these services included assistance regarding federal, state and international tax preparation, planning, and consultation. Both years included services related to the Company's analysis of the tax considerations of the Company's acquisitions and general consultation and assistance with tax audits.

All Other Fees. Represents the license of technical accounting research software.

The Audit and Finance Committee considers whether the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, and has determined such services for fiscal 2018 and 2017 were compatible.
Audit and Finance Committee Policy on Pre-Approval of Services
The Audit and Finance Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The Audit and Finance Committee has delegated authority to the Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee to pre-approve services up to a designated amount. A summary of any new services pre-approved by the Chair is reported to the full Audit and Finance Committee in connection with its next scheduled meeting.
The Audit and Finance Committee meets with representatives of Ernst & Young periodically, but no less than quarterly throughout the year. The Audit and Finance Committee reviews audit, non-audit and tax services rendered by and the performance of Ernst & Young, as well as fees charged by Ernst & Young for such services. In engaging Ernst & Young for the services described above, the Audit and Finance Committee considered whether the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining Ernst & Young's independence.

Audit and Finance Committee Report
Pursuant to authority delegated by the Board of Directors of Hologic, Inc., the Audit and Finance Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in its oversight of the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the qualifications and independence of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and the Company's internal financial and accounting controls.
Management is responsible for the Company's financial reporting process, including the responsibility to maintain and evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing those financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with GAAP. The Audit and Finance Committee's responsibility is to oversee and review these processes. The Audit and Finance Committee is not, however, engaged in the practice of accounting or auditing and does not provide any expert or other special assurance as to such financial statements concerning compliance with laws, regulations or GAAP or as to the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Finance Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Finance Committee's responsibilities are described in a written charter. A copy of the Audit and Finance Committee's current charter is publicly available on our website at investors.hologic.com.
All members of the Audit and Finance Committee are independent directors as defined by NASDAQ listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit and Finance Committee met 10 times during fiscal 2018. The meetings were designed, among other things, to facilitate and encourage communication among the Audit and Finance Committee, management, the internal audit function and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young"). The Audit and Finance Committee discussed with Ernst & Young the overall scope and plans for its audits and the Committee regularly met with Ernst & Young without the presence of management. Ernst & Young has unrestricted access to the Audit and Finance Committee.
The Audit and Finance Committee reviewed and discussed with management and Ernst & Young the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018, the results of management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the independent auditor's audit of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit and Finance Committee also discussed with Ernst & Young the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard (AS) 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees" issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB").
The Audit and Finance Committee also received and reviewed the written disclosure and the letter from Ernst & Young required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Ernst & Young's communications with the Audit and Finance Committee concerning independence, including relevant considerations of non-audit services and fees, and the Audit and Finance Committee discussed with Ernst & Young its independence from the Company.
Based on the review and discussions described above, and subject to the limitations on the Audit and Finance Committee's role and responsibilities referred to above and in its charter, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018. The Audit and Finance Committee has also approved the selection of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2019.

Stock Ownership
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors and holders of more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock. Such persons are required by regulations of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all such filings. As a matter of practice, our administrative staff assists our officers and directors in preparing initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership and files those reports on their behalf. Based on our review of the copies of such forms we have received, as well as information provided and representations made by the reporting persons, we believe that all required Section 16(a) filing requirements were met with respect to the period ended September 29, 2018.

At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote upon matters that are summarized in the formal meeting notice. The proxy statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote on the matters before the meeting. Please read it carefully.
WHO CAN VOTE?

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING
HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES?
You may vote in person or by proxy. Your execution of a proxy will not in any way affect your right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. If you are a stockholder of record (that is, if you hold shares that are directly registered in your own name), there are four ways to vote:
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record, which is known as being held in "street name," you will receive separate voting instructions with your proxy materials. If you hold your shares in street name, your ability to vote by internet or by telephone depends on the voting process of the bank, broker or other holder of record that holds your shares.
Although most banks, brokers and other holders of record also offer internet and telephone voting, availability and specific procedures will depend on their voting arrangements. Please follow their directions carefully. If you want to vote shares that you hold in street name at the Annual Meeting, you must request a legal proxy from the bank, broker, or other holder of record that holds your shares and present that proxy, along with valid photo identification and sufficient proof of share ownership as of the record date, at the meeting. We reserve the right to deny admittance to anyone who cannot show valid identification or sufficient proof of share ownership as of the record date.
CAN I CHANGE MY VOTE AFTER I HAVE VOTED?
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the Annual Meeting by: (1) filing with our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation, (2) executing a later dated proxy relating to the same shares and delivering it to our Corporate Secretary or (3) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not in and of itself constitute a revocation of a proxy).
HOW MANY SHARES MUST BE PRESENT TO HOLD THE ANNUAL MEETING?
A majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or by proxy to hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum. Votes withheld, abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present or represented for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. A "non-vote" occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner votes on one proposal, but does not vote on another proposal because, in respect of such other proposal, the broker does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Shares voted in the manner described above will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting. If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.
If your shares are held in street name, you should contact your bank, broker or other nominee to revoke your proxy or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting, you may change your vote by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Any written notice of revocation or subsequent proxy should be sent to the attention of our Corporate Secretary, Hologic, Inc., 250 Campus Drive, Marlborough, MA 01752, at or before the final vote at the Annual Meeting.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING
WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE EACH PROPOSAL AND HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED?
A nominee will be elected to the Board of Directors if the votes cast "for" the nominee's election exceed the votes cast "against" the nominee's election. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on this proposal.
In accordance with our Bylaws, if any nominee for director in an uncontested election fails to receive a majority of the votes cast "for" the nominee's election, the nominee must promptly tender his or her resignation to our Board of Directors. This is an uncontested election of directors because the number of nominees for director does not exceed the number of directors to be elected. Within 90 days after the certification of the election results, the remaining members of our Board of Directors shall, through a process managed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and excluding the director nominee in question, determine whether to accept such resignation and publicly disclose the results of such determination.
Approval of Proposals No. 2 and No. 3 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present, in person or represented by proxy, and voting on each such matter at the Annual Meeting.
Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are included in the number of shares present or represented for purposes of quorum, but are disregarded for purposes of determining whether any of the proposals have been approved.
Banks, brokers, or other holders of record may vote shares held for a customer in street name on matters that are considered to be "routine" even if they have not received instructions from their customer. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a bank, broker, or other holder of record has not received voting instructions from a customer and cannot vote the customer's shares because the matter is not considered routine.
One of the proposals before the Annual Meeting this year is deemed a "routine" matter, namely the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 (Proposal No. 3), which means that if your shares are held in street name your bank, broker, or other nominee can vote your shares on that proposal if you do not provide timely instructions for voting your shares. The election of directors (Proposal No. 1) and the non-binding advisory vote to approve executive compensation (Proposal No. 2) are not considered "routine" matters. As a result, if you do not instruct your bank, broker or nominee how to vote with respect to those matters, your bank, broker or nominee may not vote on those proposals and a broker "non-vote" will occur.
ARE THERE OTHER MATTERS TO BE VOTED ON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING?
We do not know of any other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your proxy authorizes us to vote, or otherwise act in accordance with the best judgment and discretion of the persons named as proxies below.
HOW ARE PROXIES VOTED?
The persons named as the proxies, Stephen P. MacMillan, Karleen M. Oberton and John M. Griffin, were selected by our Board of Directors. Mr. MacMillan is a director and officer of Hologic, and Ms. Oberton and Mr. Griffin are officers of Hologic. All properly executed proxies returned in time to be counted at the Annual Meeting will be voted. When giving your proxy, you may withhold authority to vote for any individual nominee for director by writing that nominee's name in the space provided on the proxy card.
WHERE CAN I FIND THE VOTING RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING?
The preliminary voting results will be announced at the Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election and published in our Current Report on Form 8-K, which we are required to file with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING AND VOTING
WHY DID I RECEIVE A ONE-PAGE NOTICE IN THE MAIL REGARDING THE INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS INSTEAD OF A FULL SET OF PROXY MATERIALS?
Under rules adopted by the SEC, we are furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders primarily via the internet, instead of mailing printed copies of those materials to each stockholder. On or about January 18, 2019, we will mail to our stockholders of record as of January 7, 2019 (other than those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery on an ongoing basis) a Notice of Meeting and Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials, including our proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K. All stockholders will have the ability to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access our proxy materials on the internet or to request printed versions are provided in the Notice. The Notice also instructs you on how to access your proxy card to vote through the internet or by telephone. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. If you have previously elected to receive our proxy materials electronically, you will continue to receive these materials via email until you elect otherwise.
HOW CAN I RECEIVE PROXY MATERIALS ELECTRONICALLY?
The Notice will provide you with instructions regarding the method of delivery for future proxy materials. Choosing to access our proxy materials via the Internet or to receive future proxy materials by email will reduce the impact of our Annual Meetings on the environment as well as decrease the cost of printing and mailing documents to you. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it.
If you hold your stock through a bank, broker or other holder of record and you would like to receive future proxy materials electronically, please refer to the information provided by that entity for instructions on how to elect this option.
HOW DO I RECEIVE A PAPER COPY OF THE MATERIALS?
If you prefer to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, you can still do so. You may request a paper copy by following the instructions provided in the Notice. The Notice also provides you with instructions on how to request paper copies of the proxy materials on an ongoing basis. There is no charge to receive the materials by mail. You may request printed copies of the materials until one year after the date of the Annual Meeting. If you have previously elected to receive printed proxy materials, you will continue to receive these materials in paper format until you elect otherwise.
WHO IS PAYING FOR THE COST OF THIS PROXY SOLICITATION?
All costs of solicitation of proxies will be borne by us. In addition to solicitations by mail, certain of our directors, officers, employees and other agents, without additional remuneration, may solicit proxies in person or by telephone or email. We may elect to engage outside professionals to assist us in the distribution and solicitation of proxies at a fee to be borne by us. Brokers, custodians and fiduciaries will be requested to forward proxy soliciting material to the owners of shares held in their names, and we will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs. Solicitation may also be made of some stockholders in person or by mail, telephone or email following the original solicitation.
Additionally, we have retained Okapi Partners LLC to assist us in the solicitation and distribution of proxies for the Annual Meeting. The estimated cost of such services is $9,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses. Stockholders with questions or that need assistance in voting their shares may contact Okapi toll-free at (877) 259-6290.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING
Deadline for Submission of Stockholder Proposals and Recommendations for Director
Stockholder proposals for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received by us no later than September 20, 2019. These proposals must also meet the other requirements of the rules of the SEC and our Bylaws.
Our Bylaws establish an advance notice procedure with regard to proposals that stockholders otherwise desire to introduce at our Annual Meeting without inclusion in our proxy statement for that meeting. Written notice of such stockholder proposals for our Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2020 must be received by our Corporate Secretary and with respect to proposals for the nomination of directors should be received by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at 250 Campus Drive, Marlborough, MA 01752 not later than December 6, 2019 and must not have been received earlier than November 8, 2019 in order to be considered timely, and must contain specified information concerning the matters proposed to be brought before such meeting and concerning the stockholder proposing such matters. The matters proposed to be brought before the meeting also must be proper matters for stockholder action. If a stockholder who wishes to present such a proposal fails to notify us within this timeframe, the proxies that management solicits for the meeting will have discretionary authority to vote on the stockholder's proposal if it is properly brought before the meeting. If a stockholder makes a timely notification, the proxies may still exercise discretionary voting authority under circumstances consistent with the proxy rules of the SEC.
Pursuant to our Bylaws, the notice must set forth: (a) for each nominee (i) information as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC, and (ii) written consent to be named in the proxy statement and serve as director if so elected; (b) a brief description of any proposed business including (i) the text of such proposal and any accompanying resolutions, (ii) the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, and (iii) any material interest held by the proposing stockholder or any beneficial owner on whose behalf the proposal is made; (c) proposing stockholder and/or beneficial owner information including (i) name and address, (ii) the class and number of shares of capital stock held, (iii) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or proposal with any of their affiliates or associates, and any others acting in concert with the foregoing, including in the case of a nomination, the nominee, (iv) a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to shares of our stock entered into by the date of such notice for the purposes of loss mitigation, risk management or derivation of benefit from share price changes and/or redistribution of voting power, (v) a representation that they are the holder of record, are entitled to vote, and intend to appear in person or by proxy and propose such business or nomination, (vi) a representation of intention to either deliver proxy statements to holders of the necessary percentage of shares or to solicit proxies or votes in support of the proposal, and (vii) any other information relating to such stockholder and/or beneficial owner required to be disclosed in filings made in connection with solicitation of proxies pursuant to the Exchange Act. The stockholder can alternatively satisfy the notice requirement by submitting proposals in compliance with SEC requirements and inclusion of such proposal within a proxy statement prepared by us. Compliance with our Bylaws shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business to the Annual Meeting (other than matters properly brought in compliance with the rules of the Exchange Act).

ANNEX A NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:
The Company has used non-GAAP financial measures in this proxy statement, including adjusted revenue and adjusted EPS.
Adjusted revenue for fiscal 2018 means our consolidated revenue determined in accordance with GAAP, calculated on a constant currency basis using the foreign currency exchange rate applied in setting the Company's fiscal 2018 budget set in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2018, adjusted revenue excludes (a) incremental revenue associated with the Company's December 2017 acquisition of Emsor S.A. ("Emsor"), which was one of the Company's distributors in Spain and Portugal; and (b) revenue from the Company's July 2018 acquisition of Faxitron Bioptics, LLC ("Faxitron").
Adjusted EPS means our consolidated net income (loss) per share (on a fully-diluted basis) determined in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude: (i) non-cash amortization of intangible assets and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets; (ii) additional depreciation expense from acquired fixed assets and accelerated depreciation expense related to business consolidation and closure of facilities; (iii) additional expense resulting from the purchase accounting adjustment to record inventory at fair value; (iv) non-cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount from the equity conversion option of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features; (v) restructuring and divestiture charges, facility closure and consolidation charges and costs incurred to integrate acquisitions (including retention, transaction bonuses, legal and professional consulting services) and separate divested businesses from existing operations; (vi) transaction-related expenses for divestitures and acquisitions; (vii) the gain on disposal of a business; (viii) debt extinguishment losses and related transaction costs; (ix) unrealized gains and losses on the mark-to-market of forward foreign currency contracts for which the Company has not elected hedge accounting; (x) litigation settlement charges and benefits, and certain non-income tax related charges and benefits not related to current year operations; (xi) other-than-temporary impairment losses on investments and realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of investments; (xii) the one-time discrete impact of tax reform primarily related to remeasuring net deferred tax liabilities; (xiii) other one-time, non-recurring, unusual or infrequent charges, expenses or gains that may not be indicative of the Company's core business results; and (xix) income taxes related to any of the foregoing adjustments. This calculation further excludes the results of Emsor S.A. and Faxitron Bioptics, LLC post-acquisition in order to level set the results for purposes of the 2018 STIP calculation.
The non-GAAP financial measures used in this proxy statement adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of Hologic's historical operating results, comparison to competitors' operating results and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the company's operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting Hologic's business.
Because non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that increase or decrease the company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The company's definition of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the following pages.
