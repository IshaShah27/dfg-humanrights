PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
To be held on Tuesday, April  9, 2019 
Questions and Answers about Proxy Materials and Voting 
This Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting, proxy card and the Annual Report to Shareholders of Mesa Air Group, Inc. (the "Company," "Mesa Air Group," "we, "us" and "our") are being mailed on or about February 25, 2019. You should read this entire Proxy Statement (this "Proxy Statement") carefully for information about the proposals to be presented at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 (our "Annual Meeting"). Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not a part of this Proxy Statement. 
The information in the "question and answer" format below is for your convenience only and provides essential information about the proxy materials and how to cast your vote at our Annual Meeting. 
What is a proxy? 
Our Board of Directors (our "Board") is asking for your proxy. This means you authorize persons selected by the Company to vote your shares at our Annual Meeting in the way that you instruct. All shares represented by valid proxies that are received and not revoked before our Annual Meeting will be voted at our Annual Meeting in accordance with the shareholder's specific voting instructions. 
Why am I receiving these materials? 
You are receiving these materials because at the close of business on February 15, 2019 (the "Record Date"), you owned shares of our common stock, no par value per share. All shareholders of record on the Record Date are entitled to attend and vote at our Annual Meeting. 
Each share of our common stock is entitled to vote at our Annual Meeting. As of December 31, 2018, we had 23,902,903 shares of common stock outstanding. With respect to all of the matters submitted for vote at our Annual Meeting, each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. 
What information is contained in this Proxy Statement? 
This Proxy Statement includes information about the nominees for directors and other matters to be voted on at our Annual Meeting. It also explains the voting process and requirements; describes the compensation of our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and our other most highly compensated executive officer (collectively referred to as our "named executive officers" or "NEOs"); describes the compensation of our directors; and provides certain other information that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") rules require.  What should I do with these materials? 
Please carefully read and consider the information contained in this Proxy Statement and then vote your shares as soon as possible to ensure that your shares will be represented at our Annual Meeting. You may vote your shares prior to our Annual Meeting even if you plan to attend our Annual Meeting in person. 
What shares are included on my proxy card? 
You will receive one proxy card for all the shares of our common stock that you hold as a shareholder of record (in certificate form or in book-entry form). 
If you hold your shares in street name, you will receive voting instructions for each account you have with a broker, bank or other nominee. 
What matters am I voting on, how may I vote on each matter and how does our Board recommend that I vote on each matter? 
The following table sets forth a description of each of the proposals you are being asked to vote on, how you may vote on each proposal and how our Board recommends that you vote on each proposal: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal     Description     How may I vote?     How does our Board recommend that I  vote? 
 Proposal 1     The election of our seven director nominees, Jonathan G. Ornstein, G. Grant Lyon, Ellen N. Artist, Mitchell I. Gordon, Dana J.  Lockhart, Spyridon Skiados and Harvey W. Schiller, each for a one-year term or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.     You may (i) vote "FOR" the election of all seven director nominees named herein; (ii)  "WITHHOLD" authority to vote for all such director nominees; or (iii) vote "FOR" the election of all such director nominees other than any nominees with respect to whom the vote is specifically  "WITHHELD" by indicating in the space provided on the proxy.     Our Board recommends that you vote "FOR" all seven of the director nominees. 
 Proposal 2     The approval of the Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.     You may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the approval of the Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase  Plan, or you may indicate that you wish to "ABSTAIN" from voting on the matter.     Our Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the approval of the Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase  Plan. 
 Proposal 3     The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.     You may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche  LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, or you may indicate that you wish to "ABSTAIN" from voting on the matter.     Our Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent  registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
 What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Computershare Inc., you are considered the "shareholder of record" with respect to those shares. The full set of proxy materials has been sent directly to you. 
If your shares are held with a broker or in an account at a bank, you are considered the "beneficial owner" with respect to those shares. These shares are sometimes referred to as being held "in street name." The full set of proxy materials would have been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record who is considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card included in the mailing or by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card for voting online or by telephone. You will not be able to vote these shares directly unless you obtain a signed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. 
How do I vote if I am the shareholder of record? 
As a shareholder of record, you may vote your shares in any one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone: Call the toll-free number shown on the proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• On the Internet: Vote on the Internet on the website shown on the proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail: Mark, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In Person: Vote in person at our Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Whether or not you plan to attend our Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote. Returning the proxy card or voting by telephone or online will not affect your right to attend our Annual Meeting and vote in person. 
How do I vote if I am a beneficial owner? 
As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares by following the instructions that your broker, bank or other nominee sent to you. You will receive proxy materials and voting instructions for each account that you have with a broker, bank or other nominee. As a beneficial owner, if you wish to change the voting instructions that you have provided your broker, bank or other nominee, you should follow the instructions that your broker, bank or other nominee sent to you. 
As a beneficial owner, you are also invited to attend our Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a signed legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee giving you the right to vote the shares. 
How can I attend our Annual Meeting? 
You are entitled to attend our Annual Meeting only if you were a shareholder of record as of the Record Date or you hold a valid proxy for our Annual Meeting as described in the previous question. Because seating is limited, admission to the meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. You should be prepared to present photo identification for admittance. If you are not a shareholder of record but hold shares as a beneficial owner, you should provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the Record Date, such as your most recent account statement prior to February 15, 2019, a copy of the voting instruction card provided by your broker, bank or other nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership.  What can I do if I change my mind after I vote? 
If you are a shareholder of record, you can revoke your proxy and/or change your vote any time before completion of voting at our Annual Meeting as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revoke your proxy: Mail written notice of revocation of your proxy to our Executive Vice President, General  Counsel and Secretary at 410 North 44th Street, Suite 700, Phoenix, Arizona 85008;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change your vote by Internet or telephone: Vote again over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m.,  Eastern Time, on April 8, 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change your vote by mail: Sign and mail on a timely basis another proxy card with a later date; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change your vote at our Annual Meeting: Attend our Annual Meeting and vote in person by ballot.   
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, you can revoke your proxy and/or change your vote as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Give new voting instructions: Submit new voting instructions in the manner provided by your bank, broker or other  nominee; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change your vote at our Annual Meeting: Contact your bank, broker or other nominee to obtain a legal proxy, as  described in the answer to the question "How do I vote if I am a beneficial owner?" above, so that you may vote your shares in person at our Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
All shares represented by valid proxies received and not revoked will be voted at our Annual Meeting in accordance with the shareholder's specific voting instructions. 
What if I return my proxy card or vote by Internet or telephone but do not specify how I want to vote? 
If you are a shareholder of record and sign and return your proxy card or complete the online or telephone voting procedures, but do not specify how you want to vote your shares, we will vote them as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of each of our director nominees, Jonathan G. Ornstein, G. Grant Lyon, Ellen  N. Artist, Mitchell I. Gordon, Dana J. Lockhart, Spyridon Skiados and Harvey W. Schiller;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval of the Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent  registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at our Annual Meeting? 
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, a quorum will exist at our Annual Meeting if shareholders holding a majority of the shares entitled to vote at our Annual Meeting are present in person or by proxy. Shareholders of record who return a proxy or vote in person at our Annual Meeting will be considered part of the quorum. Abstentions are counted as "present" for determining a quorum. 
How are votes counted? 
In the election of the seven directors, your vote may be cast "FOR" all of the nominees or your vote may be "WITHHELD" with respect to one or more of the nominees. If you withhold your vote with respect to any nominee, your shares will not be considered to have been voted for or against the nominee.  For all other proposals, your vote may be cast "FOR" or "AGAINST," or you may "ABSTAIN." If you "ABSTAIN," it has the same effect as a vote "AGAINST." If you sign your proxy card with no further instructions and you are a shareholder of record, then your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of our Board. 
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals? 
The following table sets forth the voting requirements with respect to each of the proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal     Description     Voting Requirement 
 Proposal 1     The election of our seven director nominees, Jonathan G. Ornstein, G. Grant Lyon, Ellen N. Artist, Mitchell I. Gordon, Dana J.  Lockhart, Spyridon Skiados and Harvey W. Schiller, each for a one-year term or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified.     Each director must be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. A plurality means that the nominees with the largest number of votes  are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be elected at our Annual Meeting. A "WITHHOLD" vote will have no effect on the vote. 
 Proposal 2     The approval of the Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan.     To be approved, this proposal must be approved by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders present in person or by proxy and  entitled to vote on the proposal, meaning that the votes cast by the shareholders "FOR" the approval of the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" the approval of the proposal. If a shareholder  votes to "ABSTAIN," it has the same effect as a vote "AGAINST." 
 Proposal 3     The ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the  fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.     To be approved, this proposal must be approved by a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders present in person or by proxy and  entitled to vote on the proposal, meaning that the votes cast by the shareholders "FOR" the approval of the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" the approval of the proposal. If a shareholder  votes to "ABSTAIN," it has the same effect as a vote "AGAINST." If you are a beneficial owner, your broker, bank or other nominee may vote your shares on this proposal without receiving voting instructions from  you. 
[END TABLE]
Other matters that may properly come before our Annual Meeting may require more than a majority vote under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, the laws of Nevada or other applicable laws. We do not know of any such matters as of the date of this Proxy Statement.  Who will count the votes? 
Our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, Brian S. Gillman, will tabulate the votes and act as the inspector of election. 
Where can I find the voting results? 
We will announce the preliminary voting results at our Annual Meeting. We will also publish voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days of our Annual Meeting. If on the date of such Form 8-K filing the inspector of election for our Annual Meeting has not certified the voting results as final, we will note in the filing that the results are preliminary and publish the final results in a subsequent Form 8-K filing within four business days after the final voting results are known. 
Who will pay the costs of soliciting these proxies? 
We will bear the entire cost of solicitation of proxies, including preparation, assembly, printing and mailing of this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and any additional information furnished to shareholders. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokers and other nominees holding shares of voting stock beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. We may reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees for their reasonable costs of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies may be supplemented by electronic means, mail, facsimile, telephone or personal solicitation by our directors, officers or other employees. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or other employees for such services. 
Are you "householding" for shareholders sharing the same address? 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or annual report, as applicable, addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. 
We have not instituted householding for shareholders of record. However, certain brokerage firms may have instituted householding for beneficial owners of shares of our common stock held through brokerage firms. If your household has multiple accounts holding shares of our common stock, you may have already received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have any questions or require additional copies of this Proxy Statement. The broker will arrange for delivery of a separate copy of this Proxy Statement promptly upon your request. Our shareholders may decide at any time to revoke a decision to household, and thereby receive multiple copies. 
What is the deadline for shareholders to propose actions for consideration at our annual meeting of shareholders for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019? 
Shareholders who wish to nominate persons for election to our Board or propose other matters to be considered at our annual meeting of shareholders for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 must provide us advance notice of the director nomination or shareholder proposal, as well as the information specified in our Amended and Restated Bylaws, no earlier than December 11, 2019, and no later than January 10, 2020. Shareholders are advised to review our Amended and Restated Bylaws, which contain the requirements for advance notice of director nominations and shareholder   proposals. Notice of director nominations and shareholder proposals must be mailed to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary at 410 North 44th Street, Suite 700, Phoenix, Arizona 85008. The requirements for advance notice of shareholder proposals under our Amended and Restated Bylaws do not apply to proposals properly submitted under Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as those shareholder proposals are governed by Rule 14a-8. We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order or take other appropriate action with respect to any director nomination or shareholder proposal that does not comply with our Amended and Restated Bylaws and other applicable requirements. 
October 28, 2019 is the deadline for shareholders to submit proposals to be included in our proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. However, if the date of our annual meeting of shareholders for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 is changed by more than 30 days from the anniversary of the date of the previous year's meeting, then the deadline will be a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy statement for our annual meeting of shareholders for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Proposals by shareholders must comply with all requirements of applicable rules of the SEC, including Rule 14a-8, and be mailed to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary at 410 North 44th Street, Suite 700, Phoenix, Arizona 85008. We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with Rule 14a-8 and other applicable requirements. 
What are the implications of being an "emerging growth company"? 
We are an "emerging growth company" under applicable federal securities laws and are therefore permitted to take advantage of certain reduced public company reporting requirements. As an emerging growth company, we provide in this Proxy Statement the scaled disclosure permitted under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, including certain executive compensation disclosures required of a "smaller reporting company," as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are not required to conduct votes seeking approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our NEOs or the frequency with which such votes must be conducted. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering (our "IPO"), (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous rolling three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer" as defined in the Exchange Act. 
Who should I call if I have any questions? 
If you have any questions about our Annual Meeting or your ownership of our voting stock, please contact our transfer agent at:

We are strongly committed to good corporate governance practices. These practices provide an important framework within which our Board and management can pursue our strategic objectives for the benefit of our shareholders. Our Board has adopted Amended and Restated Corporate Governance Guidelines (our "Corporate Governance Guidelines") that set forth the role of our Board, director independence standards, Board structure and functions, director selection considerations and other governance policies. In addition, our Board has adopted written charters for each of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, as well as the Mesa Air Group, Inc. Code of Conduct and Ethics (our "Code of Conduct") that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews our Corporate Governance Guidelines annually, and recommends changes to our Board as warranted. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our committee charters, and our Code of Conduct, and any waivers or amendments to our Code of Conduct, are all available on our investor relations website (http://investor.mesa-air.com) in the "Corporate Governance – Governance Overview" section. 
Director Independence 
Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"). Under the listing requirements and rules of Nasdaq, independent directors must comprise a majority of our Board. In addition, the rules of Nasdaq require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees be independent. Under Nasdaq rules, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of that company's board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Compensation committee members must not have a relationship with us that is material to the director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member. Additionally, audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. To be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. 
Our Board has undertaken a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our Board has determined that other than Jonathan G. Ornstein, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, our directors do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing requirements and rules of Nasdaq. Accordingly, a majority of our directors are independent, as required under applicable Nasdaq listing rules. In making this determination, our Board considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with the Company and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence. 
Board Leadership 
Although our Board does not have a formal policy as to whether the roles of Chairman of our Board and Chief Executive Officer should be combined or separated, Mr. Ornstein serves as both the Chairman of our Board and our Chief Executive Officer. Our Board believes that the current board   leadership structure, coupled with a strong emphasis on board independence, provides effective independent oversight of management while allowing our Board and management to benefit from Mr. Ornstein's extensive executive leadership and operational experience. We do not currently have a lead independent director. Our Board has determined that this leadership structure is appropriate as our Board believes that its other structural features, including eight independent, non-employee directors on a board currently consisting of nine directors and key committees consisting wholly of independent directors, provide for substantial independent oversight of the Company's management. Independent directors and management sometimes have different perspectives and roles in strategy development. Our independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from outside of the Company, while Mr. Ornstein brings experience and expertise specific to Mesa Air Group. 
Executive Sessions of Non-Employee Directors 
To encourage and enhance communication among non-employee directors, and as required under applicable Nasdaq rules, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the non-employee directors will meet in executive sessions without management directors or our management on a periodic basis. Accordingly, our Board holds executive sessions at which only those directors who are "independent," within the meaning of currently applicable Exchange Act rules and the Nasdaq Listing Rules, are present. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the presiding director at the executive sessions is designated by our non-employee directors. 
Communications with our Board of Directors 
Shareholders or interested parties who wish to communicate with our Board or with an individual director may do so by mail to our Board or the individual director, care of our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary at 410 North 44th Street, Suite 700, Phoenix, Arizona 85008. The communication should indicate that it contains a shareholder or interested party communication. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, all such communication will be reviewed by our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, in consultation with appropriate directors as necessary, and, if appropriate, will be forwarded to the director or directors to whom the communications are addressed or, if none are specified, to the Chairman of our Board. 
Committees of our Board of Directors 
Our Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee which have the composition and responsibilities described below. Our Board may establish other committees to facilitate the management of our business. Copies of the charters of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are available in the "Corporate Governance – Governance Overview" section of our investor relations website (http://investor.mesa-air.com). Members serve on these committees until their resignation or until otherwise determined by our Board.  The following table sets forth the standing committees of our Board and the members of each such committee for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and as of the date of this Proxy Statement:

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee 
Our Audit Committee consists of Ms. Artist and Messrs. Gordon and Lockhart, with Ms. Artist serving as our Audit Committee Chair. Pursuant to our Audit Committee charter, Audit Committee membership shall consist of at least three Board members, all of whom qualify as independent within the meaning of our Corporate Governance Guidelines and satisfy the independence requirements of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. Our Audit Committee charter also requires members to have financial literacy and familiarity with fundamental financial statements that would allow them to understand key business and financial controls in the primary industries in which we operate. 
Our Board has determined that Ms. Artist and Messrs. Gordon and Lockhart are independent under the Nasdaq Listing Rules and Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. In addition, our Board has determined that Ms. Artist is an "audit committee financial expert" within the meaning of SEC regulations. We are permitted to phase-in our compliance with the independent audit committee requirements set forth in Nasdaq rules and relevant SEC rules as follows: (1) one independent member at the time of listing, (2) a majority of independent members within 90 days of listing and (3) all independent members within one year of listing. Our Board has also determined that each member of our Audit Committee can read and understand fundamental financial statements in accordance with applicable requirements. In arriving at these determinations, our Board has examined each Audit Committee member's scope of experience and the nature of their employment in the corporate finance sector. 
The primary purpose of our Audit Committee is to discharge the responsibilities of our Board with respect to our accounting, financial and other reporting and internal control practices and to oversee our independent registered public accounting firm.

Board and Committee Meetings and Attendance 
Our Board is responsible for the oversight of Company management, the strategy of the Company and establishing corporate policies. Our Board and its committees meet throughout the year on a regular schedule, and also hold special meetings and act by written consent from time to time. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, our Board met seven times. Our Audit Committee met five times during the last fiscal year. Our Compensation Committee met four times during the last fiscal year. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met five times during the last fiscal year. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, each director attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served. We encourage our directors and director nominees to attend our Annual Meeting. We completed our IPO in August 2018; accordingly we did not have an annual meeting of our shareholders as a public company in 2018. 
Risk Oversight 
Our Board oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and to enhance shareholder value. A fundamental part of risk management   is not only understanding the most significant risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for a given company. Our Board, as a whole, determines the appropriate level of risk for us, assesses the specific risks that we face and reviews management's strategies for adequately mitigating and managing the identified risks. Although our Board administers this risk management oversight function, the committees of our Board support our Board in discharging its oversight duties and addressing risks inherent in their respective areas. 
Our Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management is undertaken. Our Audit Committee monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Our Audit Committee also monitors management's preparedness for and responses to data security incidents. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee monitors the effectiveness of our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Our Compensation Committee assesses and monitors whether our compensation philosophy and practices have the potential to encourage excessive risk-taking and evaluates compensation policies and practices that could mitigate such risks. 
At periodic meetings of our Board and its committees, management reports to and seeks guidance from our Board and its committees with respect to the most significant risks that could affect our business, such as legal, financial, tax and audit-related risks. In addition, among other matters, management provides our Audit Committee periodic reports on our compliance programs and investment policy and practices. 
Nominations Process and Director Qualifications 
Nomination to our Board of Directors 
Candidates for nomination to our Board are selected by our Board based on the recommendations of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter, our policies, our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the criteria adopted by our Board regarding director candidate qualifications. In recommending candidates for nomination, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates recommended by directors, officers and employees, as well as candidates that are properly submitted by shareholders in accordance with our policies and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, using the same criteria to evaluate all such candidates. Evaluations of candidates generally involve a review of background materials, internal discussions and interviews with selected candidates as appropriate and, in addition, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may engage consultants or third-party search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating potential director nominees. 
Additional information regarding the process for properly submitting shareholder nominations for candidates for membership on our Board is set forth above under "Questions and Answers About Proxy Materials and Voting." 
Director Qualifications 
With the goal of developing a diverse, experienced and highly qualified board of directors, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for developing and recommending to our Board the desired qualifications, expertise and characteristics of members of our Board, including qualifications that our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes must be met by a committee-recommended nominee for membership on our Board and specific qualities or skills that our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes are necessary for one or more of the members of our Board to possess.  In addition to the qualifications, qualities, and skills that are necessary to meet U.S. legal and regulatory requirements, Nasdaq's listing requirements, the provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and each of the charters of our Board committees, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee requires the following minimum qualifications to be satisfied by any nominee for a position on our Board: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal and professional ethics and integrity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• proven achievement and competence in the nominee's field and the ability to exercise sound business judgment;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• skills that are complementary to those of the existing Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability to assist and support management and make significant contributions to our success;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an understanding of the fiduciary responsibilities that are required of a member of our Board; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the commitment of time and energy necessary to diligently carry out these responsibilities.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that a diverse, experienced and highly qualified board of directors fosters a robust, comprehensive and balanced decision-making process for the continued effective functioning of our Board and success of the Company. Accordingly, through the nomination process, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to promote Board membership that reflects diversity, factoring in gender, race, ethnicity, differences in professional background, education, skill, experience and other individual qualities and attributes that contribute to the total mix of viewpoints and experience. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the foregoing factors, among others, and does not assign any particular weighting or priority to any of the factors. 
Proposal 1 sets forth a brief biographical description of each nominee's primary individual experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led our Board to recommend such nominee to serve as a member of our Board.  PROPOSAL 1: 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Composition of our Board of Directors 
Our Board currently consists of nine directors. All directors serve a one-year term and are subject to re-election each year. Two current directors, Messrs. Altobello and Picco, are not standing for re-election at our Annual Meeting. Accordingly, pursuant to our Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Board has adopted a resolution to reduce the size of our Board from nine directors to seven effective as of our Annual Meeting. 
On the recommendation of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board has nominated the following persons for election as directors at our Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Jonathan G. Ornstein

If elected, each nominee will serve until his or her term expires at our annual meeting of shareholders for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. See "Director Nominees" below for more information about each nominee. 
All of the nominees are currently serving as directors of Mesa Air Group and have consented to being named as nominees. Shareholders voting in person or by proxy at our Annual Meeting may only vote for seven nominees. If, prior to our Annual Meeting, any of the nominees becomes unable to serve as a director, our Board may designate a substitute nominee. In that event, the persons named as proxies intend to vote for the substitute nominee designated by our Board. 
Our Board and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believe that each of the following nominees possesses the experience and qualifications that directors of Mesa Air Group should possess, as described in detail above, and that the experience and qualifications of each nominee compliments the experience and qualifications of the other nominees. The experience and qualifications of each nominee, including information regarding the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led our Board and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to conclude that he or she should serve as a director of Mesa Air Group at the present time, in light of our business and structure, are set forth below 
Vote Required 
If a quorum is present, directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of the holders of shares present at the meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Accordingly, the nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected. Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the nominees named below. If a nominee becomes unavailable for election as a result of an unexpected occurrence,   shares that would have been voted for that nominee will instead will be voted for the election of a substitute nominee proposed by us. 
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the election of all seven nominees listed below.

 PROPOSAL 2: 
APPROVAL OF THE MESA AIR GROUP, INC. 2019 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
On January 28, 2019, our Board adopted the Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). If approved by our shareholders, the ESPP authorizes the issuance of up to 500,000 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment for certain changes in our capital structure) to eligible employees. 
Our Board believes that the ESPP advances our interests and the interests of our shareholders by providing our employees with an opportunity through payroll deductions to purchase shares and is helpful in attracting, retaining and rewarding valued employees. To provide an adequate reserve to permit us to continue offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares, our Board has adopted the ESPP, subject to and effective upon the date of shareholder approval. 
Summary of the ESPP 
The following is a summary of the material features of the ESPP and does not describe all of the ESPP's provisions. We encourage you to read the complete text of the ESPP that is included as an appendix to this Proxy Statement. 
General 
The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code, but also permits us to include non-United States employees, if any, in offerings not intended to qualify under Section 423. Each participant in the ESPP is granted at the beginning of each offering under the ESPP (an "Offering") the right to purchase (a "Purchase Right") through accumulated post-tax payroll deductions up to a number of shares determined on the first day of the Offering. The Purchase Right is automatically exercised on each purchase date during the Offering, unless the participant has withdrawn from participation in the ESPP prior to such date. 
Administration 
The ESPP is administered by our Compensation Committee or other committee or subcommittee duly appointed by our Board to administer the ESPP. Subject to the provisions of the ESPP, our Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of Purchase Rights granted under the ESPP. Our Compensation Committee will interpret the ESPP and the Purchase Rights granted, and all determinations of our Compensation Committee will be final and binding on all persons having an interest in the ESPP or any Purchase Right. We will pay all expenses and liabilities incurred in the administration of the ESPP. 
Shares Subject to the ESPP 
The ESPP authorizes the sale of an aggregate of up to 500,000 shares, subject to adjustment, which shares shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares, or any combination thereof. Any shares issued under the ESPP will reduce, on a share-for-share basis, the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP. If any Purchase Right expires, terminates or is canceled, the shares allocable to the unexercised portion of such Purchase Right will again be available for issuance under the ESPP. To prevent dilution or enlargement of the rights of participants under the ESPP, appropriate and proportionate adjustments to the number of shares subject to the ESPP will be made if any change is made to the outstanding shares by reason of merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares or any similar change in our capital structure not involving the receipt of consideration by us.  Offerings 
The ESPP operates by offering eligible employees options through a series of successive offering periods beginning on or about each February 16 and August 16 (each, an "Offering Period"). Our Compensation Committee may establish a different term for one or more Offerings, not to exceed 27 months, or different beginning or ending dates for any Offering Period. The last day of each Offering Period shall be a purchase date. 
If the fair market value of the shares on any purchase date (other than the last purchase date of an Offering Period) is less than on the first day of the Offering Period, then all participants will be withdrawn from the Offering Period after the exercise of their Purchase Rights on such purchase date and enrolled as participants in a new Offering Period beginning on the next trading day following such purchase date, provided that the participant remains an eligible employee. 
Eligibility 
An eligible participant in the ESPP in the U.S. includes any of our employees (or any employees of our designated subsidiaries) (a) whose customary employment is more than 20 hours per week and more than five months in a calendar year and (b) who after the granting of a Purchase Right would not be deemed for purposes of Section 423 of the Code to possess five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our stock or the stock of any of our subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions in accordance with applicable law). If any local laws applicable to any of our non-United States employees require that participation in the ESPP be extended to additional classes of employees or otherwise impose different terms or restrictions on their participation, those requirements may be satisfied through separate Offerings under the ESPP not intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, and such separate Offerings will be treated as part of a "Non-423 Plan" component of the ESPP. Employees in certain jurisdictions having unfavorable laws regarding stock purchase plans may be excluded from participating in the ESPP. As of September 30, 2018, approximately 3,408 employees, excluding four executive officers, would have been eligible to participate in the ESPP were it then in effect. 
Participation and Purchase of Shares 
Participation in an Offering under the ESPP is limited to eligible employees who deliver a properly completed subscription agreement and, with the exception of non-United States employees, if any, for whom local law will not permit such deductions, who authorize payroll deduction contributions under the ESPP prior to the first day of the Offering Period (the "Offering Date"). Payroll deductions may not exceed 15% (or such other rate as our Compensation Committee determines) of an employee's compensation on any payday during the Offering Period. Our Compensation Committee will specify alternative means for funding Share purchases under the ESPP by non-United States employees, if any, in jurisdictions where local law will not permit payroll deductions. An employee who becomes a participant in the ESPP will automatically participate in each subsequent Offering Period beginning immediately after the last day of the Offering Period in which he or she is a participant until the employee withdraws from the ESPP, becomes ineligible to participate or terminates employment. For purposes of the ESPP, eligible compensation generally includes regular base pay, but does not include (a) bonuses, (b) contributions to and payments from any plan of deferred compensation, (c) premiums paid for group insurance coverages, welfare benefits, care and expense allowances and similar payments, (d) moving expense reimbursements, (e) severance payments or (f) accrued but unused vacation pay. 
Subject to any uniform limitations or notice requirements imposed by us, a participant may increase or decrease his or her rate of payroll deductions or withdraw from the ESPP at any time during an   Offering. Upon withdrawal, we will refund without interest the participant's accumulated payroll deductions not previously applied to the purchase of shares. Once a participant withdraws from an Offering, that participant may not again participate in the same Offering. 
Subject to certain limitations, and unless different terms are specified by our Compensation Committee, each participant in an Offering is granted a Purchase Right for a number of whole shares determined by dividing the product of $2,083.33 and the number of months in the Offering Period by the fair market value of a share on the Offering Date, provided that no participant's Purchase Right may exceed 300 shares multiplied by the number of months in the Offering Period. In any event, no participant may be granted a Purchase Right that would allow the participant to purchase shares under the ESPP or any other employee stock purchase plan of Mesa Air Group or any of our subsidiaries having a fair market value (measured on the first day of the Offering Period in which the shares are purchased) exceeding $25,000 for each calendar year in which the Purchase Right is outstanding at any time. Purchase Rights are nontransferable and may only be exercised by the participant. 
On each purchase date, we will issue to each participant in the Offering the number of shares determined by dividing the amount of payroll deductions (or other funds that may have been contributed by certain non-United States participants) accumulated for the participant during the Offering Period by the purchase price, limited in any case by the number of shares subject to the participant's Purchase Right for that Offering. The price at which shares are sold under the ESPP is established by our Compensation Committee but may not be less than 90% of the fair market value per share on the Offering Date or the purchase date, whichever is less. The fair market value of the shares on any relevant date generally will be the closing price per share as reported on Nasdaq. Any amounts credited to a participant's plan account not applied to the purchase of shares will be returned to the participant without interest, unless the amount remaining is less than the amount necessary to purchase a whole share, in which case the remaining amount may be applied to the next Offering Period, or will be refunded in the event the employee chooses not to participate in the ESPP during such Offering Period. 
Change in Control of Mesa Air Group 
The ESPP provides that a "Change in Control" occurs upon (a) a person or entity (with certain exceptions described in the ESPP) becoming the direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 50% of our voting stock; (b) shareholder approval of a liquidation or dissolution of Mesa Air Group; or (c) the occurrence of any of the following events upon which our shareholders immediately before the event do not retain immediately after the event direct or indirect beneficial ownership of more than 50% of the voting securities of Mesa Air Group, its successor or the entity to which our assets were transferred: (i) a sale or exchange by our shareholders in a single transaction or series of related transactions of more than 50% of our voting stock; (ii) a merger or consolidation in which we are a party; or (iii) the sale, exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of our assets (other than a sale, exchange or transfer to one or more of our subsidiaries). If a Change in Control occurs, then, unless the surviving or acquiring corporation assumes or continues the outstanding Purchase Rights or substitutes equivalent rights for such corporation's shares, the ESPP participants' accumulated payroll deductions will be applied to purchase shares on a date in the current Offering Period before the Change in Control, as specified by our Compensation Committee. 
Termination or Amendment 
Our Compensation Committee may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the ESPP, except that the approval of our shareholders is required within twelve months of the adoption of any amendment that either increases the number of shares authorized for issuance under the ESPP or changes the definition of the corporations whose employees may participate in the ESPP.  Term 
The ESPP will continue until terminated by our Compensation Committee. 
Market Value 
The closing price of a share on December 31, 2018 was $7.71. 
Summary of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following summary is intended only as a general guide to the United States federal income tax consequences of participation in the ESPP and does not attempt to describe all possible federal or other tax consequences of such participation or tax consequences based on particular circumstances. 
Generally, there are no tax consequences to an employee of either becoming a participant in the ESPP or purchasing shares under the ESPP. The tax consequences of a disposition of shares vary depending on the period such stock is held before its disposition. If a participant disposes of shares within two years after the Offering Date or within one year after the purchase date on which the shares are acquired (a "Disqualifying Disposition"), the participant recognizes ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date and the purchase price. Such income may be subject to withholding of tax. Any additional gain or resulting loss recognized by the participant from the disposition of the shares is a capital gain or loss. 
If the participant disposes of shares at least two years after the Offering Date and at least one year after the purchase date on which the shares are acquired, the participant recognizes ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of disposition and the purchase price or (ii) the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the Offering Date and the purchase price (determined as if the Purchase Right were exercised on the Offering Date). Any additional gain recognized by the participant on the disposition of the shares is a capital gain. If the fair market value of the shares on the date of disposition is less than the purchase price, there is no ordinary income, and the loss recognized is a capital loss. If the participant owns the shares at the time of the participant's death, the lesser of (i) the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of death and the purchase price or (ii) the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the Offering Date and the purchase price (determined as if the Purchase Right were exercised on the Offering Date) is recognized as ordinary income in the year of the participant's death. 
If the exercise of a Purchase Right does not constitute an exercise pursuant to an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code, the exercise of the Purchase Right will be treated as the exercise of a nonstatutory stock option. The participant would therefore recognize ordinary income on the purchase date equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the purchase price. Such income is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Any gain or loss recognized on a subsequent sale of the shares, as measured by the difference between the sale proceeds and the sum of (i) the purchase price for such shares and (ii) the amount of ordinary income recognized on the exercise of the Purchase Right, will be treated as a capital gain or loss, as the case may be. 
If the participant disposes of the shares in a Disqualifying Disposition, we would be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant as a result of the disposition, except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code or the regulations thereunder. In all other cases, we are allowed no other deduction.  New Plan Benefits and Additional Information 
Because benefits under the ESPP will depend on employees' elections to participate and the fair market value of the shares at various future dates, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by employees if the ESPP is approved by our shareholders. None of the 500,000 shares reserved for issuance pursuant to the ESPP have previously been issued. Non-employee directors are not eligible to participate in the ESPP. 
Vote Required and our Board's Recommendation 
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this proposal. If you hold your shares in your own name and abstain from voting on this matter, your abstention will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. If you hold your shares through a broker and you do not instruct the broker on how to vote on this proposal, your broker will not have authority to vote your shares. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. 
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval of the ESPP.  PROPOSAL 3: 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our Audit Committee has re-appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and has further directed that management submit this selection for ratification by our shareholders at our Annual Meeting. Although ratification by shareholders is not required by law, we have determined that it is good practice to request ratification of this selection by our shareholders. In the event that Deloitte & Touche LLP is not ratified by our shareholders, our Audit Committee will review its future appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our financial statements since 2010. 
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to be present during our Annual Meeting, where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. Our Board is submitting this selection as a matter of good corporate governance and because we value our shareholders' views on our independent registered public accounting firm. Neither our Amended and Restated Bylaws nor other governing documents or law require shareholder ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. If our shareholders fail to ratify this selection, our Board will reconsider whether or not to retain Deloitte & Touche LLP. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Board may direct the appointment of different independent auditors at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of Mesa Air Group and its shareholders. 
Vote Required 
An affirmative vote from holders of a majority in voting power of the shares present at the meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal will be required to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
Consistent with the requirements of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") regarding auditor independence, our Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation, retaining and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, our Audit Committee has adopted a policy and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. The policy generally pre-approves specified services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of our Audit Committee's approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent auditor or on an individual, explicit and case-by-case basis before the independent auditor is engaged to provide each service. All of the services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 described above were pre-approved by our Audit Committee or our Board. Our Audit Committee has determined that the rendering of services other than audit services by Deloitte & Touche LLP is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence. 
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September  30, 2019. 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 with the management of Mesa Air Group. The Audit Committee has discussed with its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standards No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees." The Audit Committee has also received the written disclosures and the letter from its independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the accounting firm's independence. Based on the foregoing, the Audit Committee has recommended to our Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018.

The material in this report is not "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC and is not to be incorporated by reference in any filing of Mesa Air Group under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, whether made before or after the date hereof and irrespective of any general incorporation language in any such filing.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
The table below sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of our NEOs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of our directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all of our directors and executive officers as a group; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each person, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock.   
[END TABLE]
The percentage of shares beneficially owned listed in the table below is based on 23,902,903 shares of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned and the percentage ownership of each of the beneficial owners listed in the table below, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of restricted common stock that have vested or will vest within 60 days of December 31, 2018, and all warrants exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2018. In some cases, we believe that foreign ownership may limit the ability of warrant holders to exercise warrants they hold, meaning that such holder may not be required, under relevant rules and regulations, to report beneficial ownership, as the holder would not be entitled to receive the underlying shares of common stock. 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. Unless otherwise indicated, the persons or entities identified in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown to be beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws. The information contained in the table below is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose, and the inclusion of any shares in the table below does not constitute an admission of beneficial ownership of those shares. Except as otherwise noted below, the address for persons listed in the table below is c/o Mesa Air Group, Inc., 410 North 44th Street, Suite 700, Phoenix, Arizona 85008.

Processes and Procedures for Compensation Decisions 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for the executive compensation programs for our executive officers and reports to our Board on its discussions, decisions and other actions. Typically, our Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to our Compensation Committee, often attends Compensation Committee meetings and is involved in the determination of compensation for our executive officers, except that our Chief Executive Officer does not make recommendations as to his own compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer, and from time to time as necessary, in consultation with our Chief Financial Officer, makes recommendations to our Compensation Committee regarding short-term and long-term compensation for all of our executive officers (other than himself) based on our results, as well as an individual executive officer's contribution toward these results and their performance toward individual goal achievement. Our Compensation Committee then reviews the recommendations and other data and makes decisions as to the total compensation for each executive officer, as well as each individual compensation component. 
Our Compensation Committee is authorized, in its sole discretion, to retain the services of one or more compensation consultants, outside legal counsel and such other advisors as necessary to assist with the execution of its duties and responsibilities. Although our Compensation Committee has not retained a compensation consultant to date, it may do so in the future.

Employment and Separation Agreements with Named Executive Officers 
Jonathan G. Ornstein 
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Ornstein on February 23, 2011, effective as of March 1, 2011, to serve as the Chairman of our Board and as our Chief Executive Officer, which agreement was amended first effective as of January 22, 2014, again effective as of June 1, 2016, and again on July 26, 2018, to consolidate the prior amendments. Under Mr. Ornstein's employment agreement, as amended and restated, we may terminate Mr. Ornstein's employment at any time with prior written notice at least one year before the intended termination date. Mr. Ornstein's employment agreement entitles him to a base salary and an opportunity to earn a cash incentive bonus, paid on a quarterly basis based upon achievement of certain benchmarks mutually agreed upon by our Board and Mr. Ornstein. Mr. Ornstein is also entitled to receive an annual equity award pursuant to the terms of our then-existing equity incentive plan, as determined by our Board or our Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, provided that such award shall have a grant date value of not less   than $800,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and any fiscal year thereafter during the term of the agreement. Mr. Ornstein's employment agreement entitles him to participate in all employee benefit plans and arrangements available to our executive officers, including flight benefits. It also contains certain confidential information covenants prohibiting Mr. Ornstein from using or disclosing any of our confidential information, other than as required in the performance of his duties as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, during the term of his employment and for two years thereafter. 
Mr. Ornstein's employment agreement also provides him with severance in the event his employment is terminated without Cause (as defined below) by us (or, in certain circumstances, by our successor-in-interest) or if he resigns for Good Reason (as defined below). If Mr. Ornstein's employment is terminated by us without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason he is entitled to payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary, plus an amount equal to the greater of (i) his target annual performance bonus or (ii) half the bonuses (incentive or otherwise) earned by Mr. Ornstein with respect to the two fiscal years immediately preceding his termination. If Mr. Ornstein is terminated by us or our successor-in-interest without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason within 12 months following a Change of Control (as defined below), he is entitled to payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary, plus the greater of (i) his target performance bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs or (ii) the highest amount of the bonuses (incentive or otherwise) paid to Mr. Ornstein with respect to the three fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which his termination occurs. Upon Mr. Ornstein's termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason, he is also entitled to the payment of continued health, dental and vision insurance premiums for himself and any covered dependents for 24 months following termination, and he is entitled to immediate vesting of any unvested equity awards. 
For purposes of Mr. Ornstein's employment agreement, "Cause" means (i) Mr. Ornstein's willful misconduct, including, but not limited to, misappropriation of trade secrets, fraud or embezzlement; (ii) Mr. Ornstein's commission of a felony offense or any crime involving dishonesty or physical harm to any person; (iii) Mr. Ornstein's material breach of his employment agreement that, if curable, is not cured within 30 days following written notice from us; or (iv) Mr. Ornstein's willful refusal to follow a lawful directive of us, which refusal is not cured within 30 days following written notice from us. "Change of Control" means that (i) any person acquires more than 50% of the voting power of our then-outstanding securities; (ii) a majority of the members of our Board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of our Board before the date of appointment or election; (iii) a tender offer or exchange offer is made where the intent of such offer is to take over control of Mesa Air Group, and such offer is consummated for the securities representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of our then-outstanding voting securities over a twelve-month period; or (iv) a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. Finally, "Good Reason" means any of the following, if not cured within 20 days of our receipt of a notice of termination by Mr. Ornstein: (i) any change by us in Mr. Ornstein's title, or any significant diminishment in Mr. Ornstein's function, duties or responsibilities from those associated with his functions, duties or responsibilities as of January 1, 2011; (ii) any material breach of the employment agreement or any other agreement between us and Mr. Ornstein which remains uncured for a period of 10 days after Mr. Ornstein gives us notice of such breach; (iii) except with Mr. Ornstein's prior written consent, relocation of Mr. Ornstein's principal place of employment to a location greater than 50 miles from Phoenix, Arizona, or requiring Mr. Ornstein to provide his services outside of Maricopa County, Arizona, for more than 50% of his working days during any consecutive six-month period; or (iv) any reduction of Mr. Ornstein's base salary, bonus opportunity or benefits, other than under circumstances in which we have imposed cuts in salary of other officers on an across-the-board basis (in which case the cuts to Mr. Ornstein's compensation must not be in a greater percentage than the reduction imposed on any other officer).  Michael J. Lotz 
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Lotz on February 23, 2011, effective as of March 1, 2011, to serve as our President and Chief Financial Officer, which agreement was amended first effective as of January 22, 2014, again effective as of June 1, 2016, and again on July 26, 2018, to consolidate the prior amendments. Under Mr. Lotz's employment agreement, as amended and restated, we may terminate Mr. Lotz's employment at any time with prior written notice at least one year before the intended termination date. Mr. Lotz's employment agreement entitles him to a base salary and an opportunity to earn a cash incentive bonus paid on a quarterly basis based upon achievement of certain benchmarks mutually agreed upon by our Board and Mr. Lotz. Mr. Lotz is also entitled to receive an annual equity award pursuant to the terms of our then-existing equity incentive plan, as determined by our Board or our Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, provided that such award shall have a grant date value of not less than $633,600 for any fiscal year following the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Mr. Lotz's employment agreement entitles him to participate in all employee benefit plans and arrangements available to our executive officers, including the flight benefits discussed above. It also contains certain confidential information covenants prohibiting Mr. Lotz from using or disclosing any of our confidential information, other than as required in the performance of his duties as our President and Chief Financial Officer, during the term of his employment and for two years thereafter. 
Mr. Lotz's employment agreement also provides him with severance in the event his employment is terminated without Cause (as defined below) by us (or, in certain circumstances, by our successor-in-interest) or if he resigns for Good Reason (as defined below). If Mr. Lotz's employment is terminated by us without Cause or if he resigns with Good Reason, he is entitled to payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary, plus the greater of (i) his target annual performance bonus or (ii) half the sum of the bonuses (incentive or otherwise) earned by Mr. Lotz with respect to the two fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which his resignation occurs. If Mr. Lotz is terminated by us or our successor-in-interest without Cause or he resigns for Good Reason within 12 months following a Change of Control (as defined below), Mr. Lotz is entitled to payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary, plus the greater of (i) his target performance bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs or (ii) the highest amount of the bonuses (incentive or otherwise) paid to Mr. Lotz with respect to the three fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which his termination occurs. Upon Mr. Lotz's termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason, he is also entitled to the payment of continued health, dental and vision insurance premiums for himself and any covered dependents for 24 months following termination, and he is entitled to immediate vesting of any unvested equity awards. 
For purposes of Mr. Lotz's employment agreement, "Cause," "Change of Control" and "Good Reason" have identical meanings to those contained in Mr. Ornstein's employment agreement, as set forth above. 
Brian S. Gillman 
We entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Gillman on April 23, 2014, effective as of September 3, 2013, to serve as our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, which agreement was amended effective as of June 1, 2016, and again on July 26, 2018, to consolidate the prior amendments. Under Mr. Gillman's employment agreement, as amended and restated, we may terminate Mr. Gillman's employment at any time with prior written notice at least one year before the intended termination date. Mr. Gillman's employment agreement entitles him to a base salary and an opportunity to earn a cash incentive bonus paid on a quarterly basis based upon achievement of certain benchmarks identical to those in Mr. Lotz's and Mr. Ornstein's employment agreements. Mr. Gillman is also entitled to receive an annual equity award pursuant to the terms of our then-existing   equity incentive plan, as determined by our Board or our Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, provided that such award shall have a grant date value of not less than $125,000 for any fiscal year following the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016. Mr. Gillman's employment agreement entitles him to participate in all employee benefit plans and arrangements available to our executive officers, including the flight benefits discussed above. It also contains certain confidential information covenants prohibiting Mr. Gillman from using or disclosing any of our confidential information, other than as required in the performance of his duties as our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, during the term of his employment and for two years thereafter. 
Mr. Gillman's employment agreement also provides him with severance in the event his employment is terminated without Cause (as defined below) by us (or, in certain circumstances, by our successor-in-interest) or if he resigns for Good Reason (as defined below). If Mr. Gillman is terminated without Cause or if he resigns with Good Reason, he is entitled to payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary, plus an amount equal to the greater of (i) his target annual performance bonus or (ii) half the sum of the bonuses (incentive or otherwise) earned by Mr. Gillman with respect to the two fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which his termination occurs. If Mr. Gillman is terminated by us or our successor-in-interest without Cause or he resigns with Good Reason within 12 months following a Change of Control (as defined below), he is entitled to payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary, plus the greater of (i) his maximum target performance bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs or (ii) the amount of all bonuses (incentive or otherwise) paid to Mr. Gillman with respect to the three fiscal years immediately preceding the year in which his termination occurs. Upon Mr. Gillman's termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason, he is also entitled to the payment of continued health, dental and vision insurance premiums for himself and any covered dependents for 24 months following termination, and he is entitled to immediate vesting of any unvested equity awards. 
For purposes of Mr. Gillman's employment agreement, "Cause," "Change of Control" and "Good Reason" have identical meanings to those contained in Mr. Ornstein's employment agreement, as set forth above.  Outstanding Equity Awards as of September 30, 2018

 Transactions With Related Persons in 2018 
Related Party Transaction Policy 
Our Board has a written policy and procedures for review and approval of transactions involving the Company and "related persons" (which includes our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members, or shareholders and their immediate family members owning 5% or more of our common stock). The policy applies to any transaction in which the Company is a participant and any related person has a direct or indirect material interest, excluding transactions: (a) involving payment or reimbursement of expenses of the related person incurred in the ordinary course of the related person's service as a director or officer of the Company; (b) where the financial or compensatory arrangements are approved or ratified by our Board; (c) where the related person's interest arises (i) only from such person's position as a director of a corporation or organization which is a party to the transaction; (ii) only from such person's direct or indirect ownership of less than a 10% equity interest in another person (other than a partnership, limited liability company, trust or similar entity) that is a party to the transaction; or (iii) from both such position and such ownership; (d) where the related person's interest arises only from the ownership of a class of equity securities of the Company and all holders of that class receive the same benefits on a pro rata basis; and (e) where an immediate family member's interest arises from his or her status as an employee of a firm, corporation or other entity for which he or she is not also an officer, director, general partner, or principal. 
Our Audit Committee reviews and approves in advance all related person transactions. In determining whether to approve a related person transaction, our Audit Committee looks to whether the related person transaction is on terms and conditions no less favorable to the Company than may reasonably be expected in arm's-length transactions with unrelated parties. Our Audit Committee will also consider such other factors as it may determine in circumstances of a particular transaction. 
Our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the material facts of all related person transactions, subject to the exceptions described above. Our Audit Committee will either approve or disapprove the entry into the related person transaction. If advance approval is not feasible, the transaction will be considered and, if our Audit Committee determines it to be appropriate, ratified at our Audit Committee's next regularly scheduled meeting. In determining whether to approve or ratify a transaction with a related person, our Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors that it determines to be appropriate, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. Information relating to our transactions with related persons is set forth immediately below. 
Transactions With Related Persons in 2018 
The following is a summary, since the beginning of our the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, of the transactions to which we have been a participant in which the amount involved, exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
American Capacity Purchase Agreement 
As of September 30, 2018, we operated 64 CRJ-900 aircraft for American under our capacity purchase agreement with American (our "American Capacity Purchase Agreement"). In exchange for providing flight services under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement, we receive a fixed monthly minimum amount per aircraft under contract plus certain additional amounts based upon the number of flights and block hours flown during each month. In addition, we may also receive incentives   or incur penalties based upon our operational performance, including controllable on-time departures and controllable completion percentages. American also reimburses us for certain costs on an actual basis, including passenger liability and hull insurance and aircraft property taxes, all as set forth in our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. Other expenses, including fuel and certain landing fees, are directly paid to suppliers by American. In addition, American also provides, at no cost to us, certain ground handling and customer service functions, as well as airport-related facilities and gates at American hubs and cities where we operate. As of December 31, 2018, American held approximately 10.5% of our outstanding common stock, which interest American received in exchange for its claims in our bankruptcy proceeding. During our fiscal 2018, we recognized approximately $359.4 million of revenue under our American Capacity Purchase Agreement. 
Indemnification Agreements 
Our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation compel indemnification of our directors and officers and permit indemnification of our employees and other agents, in each case to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for indemnification of our directors, officers, employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by Nevada law. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and NEOs containing provisions which are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in Nevada law. The indemnification agreements may require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors and officers against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors and officers and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. 
Termination of Shareholders' Agreements 
In January 2019, we agreed to terminate various shareholders' agreements with our 5% shareholders, including American Airlines, Inc., Penguin Lax, Inc. and P Marblegate Ltd., that contained voting covenants and irrevocable proxies in favor of our Board.  Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) under the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such reports furnished to us and written representations that no other reports were required, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with, except that (1) due to an inadvertent mistake, Mr. Skiados filed a late report on Form 4 related to the acquisition of restricted common stock awards under our 2018 Plan in August 2018 in exchange for the cancellation of all outstanding equity grants awarded to him, and (2) American Airlines, Inc. failed to timely file a Form 3 to report its initial statement of beneficial ownership of 2,500,000 shares of our common stock. 
Other Matters 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, our Board knows of no other business that will be conducted at our Annual Meeting other than as described in this Proxy Statement. If any other matter or matters are properly brought before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
We have filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 with the SEC. It is available free of charge at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Shareholders can also access this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K in the "Financial Information – SEC Filings" section of our investor relations website (http://investor.mesa-air.com). We will provide, free of charge, a copy of any of our corporate documents listed above upon written request to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary at 410 North 44th Street, Suite 700, Phoenix, Arizona 85008.

The Plan is comprised of the Section 423 Plan and the Non-423 Plan. The Company intends that the Section 423 Plan qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code (including any amendments or replacements of such section), and the Section 423 Plan shall be so construed. The Non-423 Plan, which is not intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code, is intended to provide Eligible Employees employed by Participating Companies outside the United States with an opportunity to purchase shares of Stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Plan but not necessarily in compliance with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code.

Any and all actions, decisions and determinations taken or made by the Committee in the exercise of its discretion pursuant to the Plan or any agreement thereunder (other than determining questions of interpretation pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 3.1) shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all persons having an interest therein.

Except as superseded by the provisions of a sub-plan, the provisions of this Plan shall govern such sub-plan. 
3.4    Power to Vary Terms with Respect to Non-U.S. Employees. In order to comply with the laws of a foreign jurisdiction, the Committee shall have the power, in its discretion and as permitted by Section 423 of the Code, to grant Purchase Rights in an Offering under the Section 423 Plan to

 citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens) that provide terms which are less favorable than the terms of Purchase Rights granted under the same Offering to Employees resident in the United States. 
3.5    Power to Establish Separate Offerings with Varying Terms. The Committee shall have the power, in its discretion, to establish separate, simultaneous or overlapping Offerings having different terms and conditions and to designate the Participating Company or Companies that may participate in a particular Offering, provided that each Offering under the Section 423 Plan shall individually comply with the terms of the Plan and the requirements of Section 423(b)(5) of the Code that all Participants granted Purchase Rights pursuant to such Offering shall have the same rights and privileges within the meaning of such section, other than for such variations in terms of Purchase Rights as permitted by Section 3.4.

All such actions by the Company with respect to the Section 423 Plan shall be taken consistent with the requirements under Section 423(b)(5) of the Code that all Participants granted Purchase Rights pursuant to an Offering shall have the same rights and privileges within the meaning of such section, except as otherwise permitted by Section 3.4 and the regulations under Section 423 of the Code.

In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of the Board or the Committee or as officers or employees of the Participating Company Group, to the extent permitted by applicable law, members of the Board or the Committee and any officers or employees of the Participating Company Group to whom authority to act for the Board, the Committee or the Company is delegated shall be indemnified by the Company against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the Plan, or any right granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable for gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct in duties; provided, however, that within sixty (60) days after the institution of such action, suit or proceeding, such person shall offer to the Company, in writing, the opportunity at its own expense to handle and defend the same. 
4.    SHARES SUBJECT TO PLAN. 
4.1    Maximum Number of Shares Issuable. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.3, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be issued under the Plan 
A-6 
 shall be 500,000. Shares issued under the Plan shall consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of Stock, or any combination thereof. If an outstanding Purchase Right for any reason expires or is terminated or canceled, the shares of Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of that Purchase Right shall again be available for issuance under the Plan. 
4.2    Adjustments for Changes in Capital Structure. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company and the requirements of Section 424 of the Code to the extent applicable, in the event of any change in the Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company, whether through merger, consolidation, reorganization, reincorporation, recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split-up, split-off, spin-off, combination of shares, exchange of shares, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of payment of a dividend or distribution to the stockholders of the Company in a form other than Stock (excepting regular, periodic cash dividends) that has a material effect on the Fair Market Value of shares of Stock, appropriate and proportionate adjustments shall be made in the number and kind of shares subject to the Plan, any limit on the number of shares which may be purchased by any Participant during an Offering Period (as described in Section 8.2), the number of shares subject to each Purchase Right, and in the Purchase Price in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of Participants' rights under the Plan. For purposes of the foregoing, conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as "effected without receipt of consideration by the Company." If a majority of the shares which are of the same class as the shares that are subject to outstanding Purchase Rights are exchanged for, converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to an Ownership Change Event) shares of another corporation (the "New Shares"), the Committee may unilaterally amend the outstanding Purchase Rights to provide that such Purchase Rights are for New Shares. In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares subject to, and the exercise price per share of, the outstanding Purchase Rights shall be adjusted in a fair and equitable manner as determined by the Committee, in its discretion. Any fractional share resulting from an adjustment pursuant to this Section shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and in no event may the Purchase Price be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the stock subject to the Purchase Right. The adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
5.    ELIGIBILITY. 
5.1    Employees Eligible to Participate. Each Employee of a Participating Company is eligible to participate in the Plan and shall be deemed an Eligible Employee, except the following: 
(a)    Any Employee who is customarily employed by the Participating Company Group for twenty (20) hours or less per week; 
(b)    Any Employee who is customarily employed by the Participating Company Group for not more than five (5) months in any calendar year; or 
(c)    Any highly compensated employee of a Participating Company (within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code) who is also required to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
An Eligible Employee shall be eligible to participate in the Section 423 Plan or the Non-423 Plan in accordance with the designation in Appendix A of the Employee's employer as either a Section 423 Plan Participating Company or a Non-423 Plan Participating Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Employee of a Participating Company designated in Appendix A as a Section 423 Plan Participating Company who is a citizen or resident of a non-United States jurisdiction (without regard to whether the Employee is also a citizen of the United States or a resident alien) may be excluded from participation 
A-7 
 in the Section 423 Plan or an Offering thereunder if either (i) the grant of a Purchase Right under the Section 423 Plan or Offering to a citizen or resident of the foreign jurisdiction is prohibited under the Local Law of such jurisdiction or (ii) compliance with the Local Law of such jurisdiction would cause the Section 423 Plan or Offering to violate the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. For purposes of participation in the Non-423 Plan, Eligible Employees shall include any other Employees of the applicable Non-423 Plan Participating Company to the extent that applicable Local Law requires participation in the Plan to be extended to such Employees, as determined by the Company. 
5.2    Exclusion of Certain Stockholders. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Employee shall be treated as an Eligible Employee and granted a Purchase Right under the Section 423 Plan if, immediately after such grant, the Employee would own, or hold options to purchase, stock of the Company or of any Parent Corporation or Subsidiary Corporation possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of such corporation, as determined in accordance with Section 423(b)(3) of the Code. For purposes of this Section 5.2, the attribution rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply in determining the stock ownership of such Employee. 
5.3    Determination by Company. The Company shall determine in good faith and in the exercise of its discretion whether an individual has become or has ceased to be an Employee or an Eligible Employee and the effective date of such individual's attainment or termination of such status, as the case may be. For purposes of an individual's participation in or other rights, if any, under the Plan as of the time of the Company's determination of whether or not the individual is an Employee, all such determinations by the Company shall be final, binding and conclusive as to such rights, if any, notwithstanding that the Company or any court of law or governmental agency subsequently makes a contrary determination as to such individual's status as an Employee. 
6.    OFFERINGS. 
6.1    Offering Periods. The Plan shall be implemented by sequential Offerings of approximately six (6) months' duration or such other duration as the Committee shall determine. Offering Periods shall commence on or about the sixteenth (16th) day of February and August of each year and end on or about the fifteenth (15th) day of the next August and February, respectively, occurring thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may establish additional or alternative concurrent, sequential or overlapping Offering Periods, a different duration for one or more Offering Periods or different commencing or ending dates for such Offering Periods; provided, however, that no Offering Period may have a duration exceeding twenty-seven (27) months. No Offering shall commence, and the Company shall not require or permit any Participant to deliver a Subscription Agreement for participation in an Offering, prior to the Registration Date. 
6.2    Non-United States Offerings. The Committee shall communicate to the Employees eligible to participate in a Non-United States Offering those terms of the Non-United States Offering that differ from the terms otherwise applicable to the relevant Offering under the Section 423 Plan a reasonable period of time prior to the Subscription Date for such Non-United States Offering. 
7.    PARTICIPATION IN THE PLAN. 
7.1    Initial Participation. An Eligible Employee may become a Participant in an Offering Period by delivering a properly completed written or electronic Subscription Agreement to the Company office or representative designated by the Company (including a third-party administrator designated by the Company) not later than the close of business on the Subscription Date established by the Company for that Offering Period. An Eligible Employee who does not deliver a properly completed Subscription Agreement in the manner permitted or required on or before the Subscription 
A-8 
 Date for an Offering Period shall not participate in the Plan for that Offering Period or for any subsequent Offering Period unless the Eligible Employee subsequently delivers a properly completed Subscription Agreement to the appropriate Company office or representative on or before the Subscription Date for such subsequent Offering Period. An Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee after the Offering Date of an Offering Period shall not be eligible to participate in that Offering Period but may participate in any subsequent Offering Period provided the Employee is still an Eligible Employee as of the Offering Date of such subsequent Offering Period. 
7.2    Continued Participation. A Participant shall automatically participate in the next Offering Period commencing immediately after the final Purchase Date of each Offering Period in which the Participant participates provided that the Participant remains an Eligible Employee on the Offering Date of the new Offering Period and has not either (a) withdrawn from the Plan pursuant to Section 12.1, or (b) terminated employment or otherwise ceased to be an Eligible Employee as provided in Section 13. A Participant who may automatically participate in a subsequent Offering Period, as provided in this Section, is not required to deliver any additional Subscription Agreement for the subsequent Offering Period in order to continue participation in the Plan. However, a Participant may deliver a new Subscription Agreement for a subsequent Offering Period in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7.1 if the Participant desires to change any of the elections contained in the Participant's then effective Subscription Agreement. 
8.    RIGHT TO PURCHASE SHARES. 
8.1    Grant of Purchase Right. Except as otherwise provided below, on the Offering Date of each Offering Period, each Participant in such Offering Period shall be granted automatically a Purchase Right consisting of an option to purchase the lesser of (a) that number of whole shares of Stock determined by dividing the Dollar Limit (determined as provided below) by the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on such Offering Date or (b) the Share Limit (determined as provided below). The Committee may, in its discretion and prior to the Offering Date of any Offering Period, (i) change the method of, or any of the foregoing factors in, determining the number of shares of Stock subject to Purchase Rights to be granted on such Offering Date, or (ii) specify a maximum aggregate number of shares that may be purchased by all Participants in an Offering or on any Purchase Date within an Offering Period. No Purchase Right shall be granted on an Offering Date to any person who is not, on such Offering Date, an Eligible Employee. For the purposes of this Section, the "Dollar Limit" shall be determined by multiplying $2,083.33 by the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in the Offering Period and rounding to the nearest whole dollar, and the "Share Limit" shall be determined by multiplying 300 shares by the number of months (rounded to the nearest whole month) in the Offering Period and rounding to the nearest whole share. 
8.2    Calendar Year Purchase Limitation. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, no Participant (whether participating in the Section 423 Plan or the Non-423 Plan) shall be granted a Purchase Right which permits his or her right to purchase shares of Stock under the Plan to accrue at a rate which, when aggregated with such Participant's rights to purchase shares under all other employee stock purchase plans of a Participating Company intended to meet the requirements of Section 423 of the Code, exceeds Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) in Fair Market Value (or such other limit, if any, as may be imposed by the Code) for each calendar year in which such Purchase Right is outstanding at any time. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Fair Market Value of shares purchased during a given Offering Period shall be determined as of the Offering Date for such Offering Period. The limitation described in this Section shall be applied in conformance with Section  423(b)(8) of the Code or any successor thereto and the regulations thereunder. 
8.3     Aggregate Purchase Date Share Limit. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee prior to the Offering Date of any Offering Period, the aggregate number of shares that may 
A-9 
 be purchased by all Participants on any Purchase Date shall not exceed one million (1,000,000) shares. Unless otherwise specified by the Committee, such limit shall apply in the aggregate to all purchases occurring under the Plan on the same date. 
9.    PURCHASE PRICE. 
The Purchase Price at which each share of Stock may be acquired in an Offering Period upon the exercise of all or any portion of a Purchase Right shall be established by the Committee; provided, however, that the Purchase Price on each Purchase Date shall not be less than ninety percent (90%) of the lesser of (a) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Offering Date of the Offering Period or (b) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Purchase Date. Subject to adjustment as provided by the Plan and unless otherwise provided by the Committee, the Purchase Price for each Offering Period shall be ninety percent (90%) of the lesser of (a) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Offering Date of the Offering Period or (b) the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Purchase Date. 
10.    ACCUMULATION OF PURCHASE PRICE THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTION. 
Except as provided in Section 11.1(b) with respect to a Non-United States Offering or except as otherwise provided by the Committee in connection with an Offering under the Non-423 Plan, shares of Stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of all or any portion of a Purchase Right may be paid for only by means of payroll deductions from the Participant's Compensation accumulated during the Offering Period for which such Purchase Right was granted, subject to the following: 
10.1    Amount of Payroll Deductions. Except as otherwise provided herein, the amount to be deducted under the Plan from a Participant's Compensation on each pay day during an Offering Period shall be determined by the Participant's Subscription Agreement. The Subscription Agreement shall set forth the percentage of the Participant's Compensation to be deducted on each pay day during an Offering Period in whole percentages of not less than one percent (1%) (except as a result of an election pursuant to Section 10.3 to stop payroll deductions effective following the first pay day during an Offering) or more than fifteen percent (15%). The Committee may change the foregoing limits on payroll deductions effective as of any Offering Date. 
10.2    Commencement of Payroll Deductions. Payroll deductions shall commence on the first pay day occurring on or following the Offering Date and shall continue to the end of the Offering Period unless sooner altered or terminated as provided herein. 
10.3    Election to Change or Stop Payroll Deductions. During an Offering Period, a Participant may elect to increase or decrease the rate of or to stop deductions from his or her Compensation by delivering to the Company office or representative designated by the Company (including a third-party administrator designated by the Company) an amended Subscription Agreement authorizing such change on or before the "Change Notice Date." The "Change Notice Date" shall be a date prior to the beginning of the first pay period for which such election is to be effective as established by the Company from time to time and announced to the Participants. A Participant who elects, effective following the first pay day of an Offering Period, to decrease the rate of his or her payroll deductions to zero percent (0%) shall nevertheless remain a Participant in such Offering Period unless the Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 12. 
10.4    Administrative Suspension of Payroll Deductions. The Company may, in its discretion, suspend a Participant's payroll deductions under the Plan as the Company deems advisable to avoid accumulating payroll deductions in excess of the amount that could reasonably be anticipated to purchase the maximum number of shares of Stock permitted (a) under the Participant's 
A-10 
 Purchase Right, or (b) during a calendar year under the limit set forth in Section 8.2. Unless the Participant has either withdrawn from the Plan as provided in Section 12.1 or has ceased to be an Eligible Employee, suspended payroll deductions shall be resumed at the rate specified in the Participant's then effective Subscription Agreement either (i) at the beginning of the next Offering Period if the reason for suspension was clause (a) in the preceding sentence, or (ii) at the beginning of the next Offering Period having a first Purchase Date that falls within the subsequent calendar year if the reason for suspension was clause (b) in the preceding sentence. 
10.5    Participant Accounts. Individual bookkeeping accounts shall be maintained for each Participant. All payroll deductions from a Participant's Compensation (and other amounts received from a non-United States Participant pursuant to Section 11.1(b) or pursuant to an Offering under the Non-423 Plan) shall be credited to such Participant's Plan account and shall be deposited with the general funds of the Company (except as otherwise required by Local Law in connecting with an Offering under the Non-423 Plan). All such amounts received or held by the Company may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose. 
10.6    No Interest Paid. Interest shall not be paid on sums deducted from a Participant's Compensation pursuant to the Plan or otherwise credited to the Participant's Plan account (except as otherwise required by Local Law in connection with an Offering under the Non-423 Plan). 
10.7    Voluntary Withdrawal from Plan Account. A Participant may withdraw all or any portion of the payroll deductions credited to his or her Plan account and not previously applied toward the purchase of Stock by delivering to the Company a written notice on a form provided by the Company for such purpose. A Participant who withdraws the entire remaining balance credited to his or her Plan account shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the Plan in accordance with Section 12.1. Amounts withdrawn shall be returned to the Participant as soon as practicable after the withdrawal and may not be applied to the purchase of shares in any Offering under the Plan. The Company may from time to time establish or change limitations on the frequency of withdrawals permitted under this Section, establish a minimum dollar amount that must be retained in the Participant's Plan account, or terminate the withdrawal right provided by this Section. 
11.    PURCHASE OF SHARES.
11.1    Exercise of Purchase Right. 
(a)    Generally. Except as provided in Section 11.1(b), on each Purchase Date of an Offering Period, each Participant who has not withdrawn from the Plan and whose participation in the Offering has not otherwise terminated before such Purchase Date shall automatically acquire pursuant to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right the number of whole shares of Stock determined by dividing (a) the total amount of the Participant's payroll deductions accumulated in the Participant's Plan account during the Offering Period and not previously applied toward the purchase of Stock by (b) the Purchase Price. However, in no event shall the number of shares purchased by the Participant during an Offering Period exceed the number of shares subject to the Participant's Purchase Right. No shares of Stock shall be purchased on a Purchase Date on behalf of a Participant whose participation in the Offering or the Plan has terminated before such Purchase Date. 
(b)    Purchase by Non-United States Participants for Whom Payroll Deductions Are Prohibited by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding Section 11.1(a), where payroll deductions on behalf of Participants who are citizens or residents of countries other than the United States (without regard to whether they are also citizens of the United States or resident aliens) are prohibited or made impracticable by applicable Local Law, the Committee may establish a separate Offering (a "Non-United States Offering") covering all Eligible Employees of one or more Participating 
A-11 
 Companies subject to such prohibition or restrictions on payroll deductions. The Non-United States Offering shall provide another method for payment of the Purchase Price with such terms and conditions as shall be administratively convenient and comply with applicable Local Law. On each Purchase Date of the Offering Period applicable to a Non-United States Offering, each Participant who has not withdrawn from the Plan and whose participation in such Offering Period has not otherwise terminated before such Purchase Date shall automatically acquire pursuant to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right a number of whole shares of Stock determined in accordance with Section 11.1(a) to the extent of the total amount of the Participant's Plan account balance accumulated during the Offering Period in accordance with the method established by the Committee and not previously applied toward the purchase of Stock. However, in no event shall the number of shares purchased by a Participant during such Offering Period exceed the number of shares subject to the Participant's Purchase Right. The Company shall refund to a Participant in a Non-United States Offering in accordance with Section 11.4 any excess Purchase Price payment received from such Participant. 
11.2    Pro Rata Allocation of Shares. If the number of shares of Stock which might be purchased by all Participants on a Purchase Date exceeds the number of shares of Stock remaining available for issuance under the Plan or the maximum aggregate number of shares of Stock that may be purchased on such Purchase Date pursuant to a limit established by the Committee pursuant to Section 8.1 or Section 8.3, the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the shares available in as uniform a manner as practicable and as the Company determines to be equitable. Any fractional share resulting from such pro rata allocation to any Participant shall be disregarded. 
11.3    Delivery of Title to Shares. Subject to any governing rules or regulations, as soon as practicable after each Purchase Date, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued to or for the benefit of each Participant the shares of Stock acquired by the Participant on such Purchase Date by means of one or more of the following: (a) by delivering to the Participant evidence of book entry shares of Stock credited to the account of the Participant, (b) by depositing such shares of Stock for the benefit of the Participant with any broker with which the Participant has an account relationship, or (c) by delivering such shares of Stock to the Participant in certificate form. 
11.4    Return of Plan Account Balance. Any cash balance remaining in a Participant's Plan account following any Purchase Date shall be refunded to the Participant as soon as practicable after such Purchase Date. However, if the cash balance to be returned to a Participant pursuant to the preceding sentence is less than the amount that would have been necessary to purchase an additional whole share of Stock on such Purchase Date, the Company may retain the cash balance in the Participant's Plan account to be applied toward the purchase of shares of Stock in the subsequent Purchase Period or Offering Period. 
11.5    Tax Withholding. At the time a Participant's Purchase Right is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time a Participant disposes of some or all of the shares of Stock he or she acquires under the Plan, the Participant shall make adequate provision for the federal, state, local and foreign taxes (including social insurance), if any, required to be withheld by any Participating Company upon exercise of the Purchase Right or upon such disposition of shares, respectively. A Participating Company may, but shall not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant's compensation the amount necessary to meet such withholding obligations. The Company or any other Participating Company shall have the right to take such other action as it determines to be necessary or advisable to satisfy withholding obligations for such taxes. 
11.6    Expiration of Purchase Right. Any portion of a Participant's Purchase Right remaining unexercised after the end of the Offering Period to which the Purchase Right relates shall expire immediately upon the end of the Offering Period. 
A-12 
11.7    Provision of Reports and Stockholder Information to Participants. Each Participant who has exercised all or part of his or her Purchase Right shall receive, as soon as practicable after the Purchase Date, a report of such Participant's Plan account setting forth the total amount credited to his or her Plan account prior to such exercise, the number of shares of Stock purchased, the Purchase Price for such shares, the date of purchase and the cash balance, if any, remaining immediately after such purchase that is to be refunded or retained in the Participant's Plan account pursuant to Section 11.4. The report required by this Section may be delivered or made available in such form and by such means, including by electronic transmission, as the Company may determine. In addition, each Participant shall be provided information concerning the Company equivalent to that information provided generally to the Company's common stockholders. 
12.    WITHDRAWAL FROM PLAN.
12.1    Voluntary Withdrawal from the Plan. A Participant may withdraw from the Plan by signing and delivering to the Company office or representative designated by the Company (including a third-party administrator designated by the Company) a written or electronic notice of withdrawal on a form provided by the Company for this purpose. Such withdrawal may be elected at any time prior to the end of an Offering Period; provided, however, that if a Participant withdraws from the Plan after a Purchase Date, the withdrawal shall not affect shares of Stock acquired by the Participant on such Purchase Date. A Participant who voluntarily withdraws from the Plan is prohibited from resuming participation in the Plan in the same Offering from which he or she withdrew, but may participate in any subsequent Offering by again satisfying the requirements of Sections 5 and 7.1. The Company may impose, from time to time, a requirement that the notice of withdrawal from the Plan be on file with the Company office or representative designated by the Company for a reasonable period prior to the effectiveness of the Participant's withdrawal. 
12.2    Automatic Withdrawal from Offering and Re-enrollment. If the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on a Purchase Date within an Offering Period (the "Old Offering Period"), other than the final Purchase Date of the Old Offering Period, is less than the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Offering Date of the Old Offering Period, then every Participant in the Old Offering Period automatically shall be (a) withdrawn from the Old Offering Period immediately after the purchase of shares on such Purchase Date and (b) enrolled in a new Offering Period of the same duration as the full term of the Old Offering Period commencing on the trading day immediately following the purchase of shares (which shall be the Offering Date of the new Offering Period), provided that the Participant then remains an Eligible Employee. 
12.3    Return of Plan Account Balance. Upon a Participant's voluntary withdrawal from the Plan pursuant to Section 12.1, the Participant's accumulated Plan account balance which has not been applied toward the purchase of shares of Stock shall be refunded to the Participant as soon as practicable after the withdrawal, without the payment of any interest (except as otherwise required by Local Law in connection with an Offering under the Non-423 Plan), and the Participant's interest in the Plan and the Offering shall terminate. Such amounts to be refunded in accordance with this Section may not be applied to any other Offering under the Plan. 
13.    TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENTOR ELIGIBILITY. 
Upon a Participant's ceasing, prior to a Purchase Date, to be an Employee of the Participating Company Group for any reason, including retirement, disability or death, or upon the failure of a Participant to remain an Eligible Employee, the Participant's participation in the Plan shall terminate immediately. In such event, the Participant's Plan account balance which has not been applied toward the purchase of shares of Stock shall, as soon as practicable, be returned to the Participant or, in the case of the Participant's death, to the Participant's beneficiary designated in accordance with 
A-13 
 Section 20, if any, or legal representative, and all of the Participant's rights under the Plan shall terminate. Interest shall not be paid on sums returned pursuant to this Section 13 (except as otherwise required by Local Law in connection with an Offering under the Non-423 Plan). A Participant whose participation has been so terminated may again become eligible to participate in the Plan by satisfying the requirements of Sections 5 and 7.1. 
14.    EFFECT OF CHANGEIN CONTROL ON PURCHASE RIGHTS. 
In the event of a Change in Control, the surviving, continuing, successor, or purchasing corporation or parent thereof, as the case may be (the "Acquiring Corporation"), may, without the consent of any Participant, assume or continue the Company's rights and obligations under outstanding Purchase Rights or substitute substantially equivalent purchase rights for the Acquiring Corporation's stock. If the Acquiring Corporation elects not to assume, continue or substitute for the outstanding Purchase Rights, the Purchase Date of the then current Offering Period shall be accelerated to a date before the date of the Change in Control specified by the Committee, but the number of shares of Stock subject to outstanding Purchase Rights shall not be adjusted. All Purchase Rights which are neither assumed or continued by the Acquiring Corporation in connection with the Change in Control nor exercised as of the date of the Change in Control shall terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the Change in Control. 
15.    NONTRANSFERABILITY OF PURCHASE RIGHTS. 
Neither payroll deductions or other amounts credited to a Participant's Plan account nor a Participant's Purchase Right may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any manner other than as provided by the Plan or by will or the laws of descent and distribution. (A beneficiary designation pursuant to Section 20 shall not be treated as a disposition for this purpose.) Any such attempted assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw from the Plan as provided in Section 12.1. A Purchase Right shall be exercisable during the lifetime of the Participant only by the Participant. 
16.    COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAW. 
The issuance of shares of Stock or other property under the Plan shall be subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state and foreign securities law and other applicable laws, rules and regulations, and approvals by government agencies as may be required or as the Company deems necessary or advisable. A Purchase Right may not be exercised if the issuance of shares upon such exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws or other law or regulations or the requirements of any securities exchange or market system upon which the Stock may then be listed. In addition, no Purchase Right may be exercised unless (a) a registration statement under the Securities Act shall at the time of exercise of the Purchase Right be in effect with respect to the shares issuable upon exercise of the Purchase Right, or (b) in the opinion of legal counsel to the Company, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Purchase Right may be issued in accordance with the terms of an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The inability of the Company to obtain from any regulatory body having jurisdiction the authority, if any, deemed by the Company's legal counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any shares under the Plan shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. As a condition to the exercise of a Purchase Right, the Company may require the Participant to satisfy any qualifications that may be necessary or appropriate, to evidence compliance with any applicable law or regulation, and to make any representation or warranty with respect thereto as may be requested by the Company. 
A-14 
17.    RIGHTSAS A STOCKHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE. 
A Participant shall have no rights as a stockholder by virtue of the Participant's participation in the Plan until the date of the issuance of the shares of Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right (as evidenced by the appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company). No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date such shares are issued, except as provided in Section 4.3. Nothing herein shall confer upon a Participant any right to continue in the employ of the Participating Company Group or interfere in any way with any right of any Participating Company to terminate the Participant's employment at any time. 
18.    NOTIFICATIONOF DISPOSITION OF SHARES. 
The Company may require the Participant to give the Company prompt notice of any disposition of shares of Stock acquired by exercise of a Purchase Right. The Company may require that until such time as a Participant disposes of shares of Stock acquired upon exercise of a Purchase Right, the Participant shall hold all such shares in the Participant's name until the later of two years after the date of grant of such Purchase Right or one year after the date of exercise of such Purchase Right. The Company may direct that the certificates evidencing shares of Stock acquired by exercise of a Purchase Right refer to such requirement to give prompt notice of disposition. 
19.    LEGENDS. 
The Company may at any time place legends or other identifying symbols referencing any applicable federal, state or foreign securities law restrictions or any provision convenient in the administration of the Plan on some or all of the certificates representing shares of Stock issued under the Plan. The Participant shall, at the request of the Company, promptly present to the Company any and all certificates representing shares acquired pursuant to a Purchase Right in the possession of the Participant in order to carry out the provisions of this Section. Unless otherwise specified by the Company, legends placed on such certificates may include but shall not be limited to the following: 
"THE SHARES EVIDENCED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED BY THE CORPORATION TO THE REGISTERED HOLDER UPON THE PURCHASE OF SHARES UNDER AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AS DEFINED IN SECTION 423 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED. THE TRANSFER AGENT FOR THE SHARES EVIDENCED HEREBY SHALL NOTIFY THE CORPORATION IMMEDIATELY OF ANY TRANSFER OF THE SHARES BY THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF. THE REGISTERED HOLDER SHALL HOLD ALL SHARES PURCHASED UNDER THE PLAN IN THE REGISTERED HOLDER'S NAME (AND NOT IN THE NAME OF ANY NOMINEE)." 
20.    DESIGNATION OF BENEFICIARY. 
20.1    Designation Procedure. Subject to applicable Local Law and procedures, a Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive (a) shares and cash, if any, from the Participant's Plan account if the Participant dies subsequent to a Purchase Date but prior to delivery to the Participant of such shares and cash, or (b) cash, if any, from the Participant's Plan account if the Participant dies prior to the exercise of the Participant's Purchase Right. If a married Participant designates a beneficiary other than the Participant's spouse, the effectiveness of such designation may be subject to the consent of the Participant's spouse. A Participant may change his or her beneficiary designation at any time by written notice to the Company. 
20.2    Absence of Beneficiary Designation. If a Participant dies without an effective designation pursuant to Section 20.1 of a beneficiary who is living at the time of the Participant's death, 
A-15 
 the Company shall deliver any shares or cash credited to the Participant's Plan account to the Participant's legal representative or as otherwise required by applicable law. 
21.    NOTICES. 
All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof. 
22.    AMENDMENT OR TERMINATIONOF THE PLAN. 
The Committee may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the Plan, except that (a) no such amendment, suspension or termination shall affect Purchase Rights previously granted under the Plan unless expressly provided by the Committee, and (b) no such amendment, suspension or termination may adversely affect a Purchase Right previously granted under the Plan without the consent of the Participant, except to the extent permitted by the Plan or as may be necessary to qualify the Section 423 Plan as an employee stock purchase plan pursuant to Section 423 of the Code or to comply with any applicable law, regulation or rule. In addition, an amendment to the Plan must be approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months of the adoption of such amendment if such amendment would authorize the sale of more shares than are then authorized for issuance under the Plan or would change the definition of the corporations that may be designated by the Committee as Participating Companies. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Committee determines that continuation of the Plan or an Offering would result in unfavorable financial accounting consequences to the Company, the Committee may, in its discretion and without the consent of any Participant, including with respect to an Offering Period then in progress: (i) terminate the Plan or any Offering Period, (ii) accelerate the Purchase Date of any Offering Period, (iii) reduce the discount or the method of determining the Purchase Price in any Offering Period (e.g., by determining the Purchase Price solely on the basis of the Fair Market Value on the Purchase Date), (iv) reduce the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be purchased in any Offering Period, or (v) take any combination of the foregoing actions. 
23.    NO REPRESENTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TAX QUALIFICATION. 
Although the Company may endeavor to (a) qualify Purchase Rights for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States (e.g., options granted under Section 423 of the Code) or (b) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, anything to the contrary in this Plan. The Company shall be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on Participants under the Plan. 
24.    CHOICE OF LAW. 
Except to the extent governed by applicable federal law, the validity, interpretation, construction and performance of the Plan and each Subscription Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Nevada, without regard to its conflict of law rules. 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Secretary of the Company certifies that the foregoing sets forth the Mesa Air Group, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan as duly adopted by the Board on January 28, 2019.
