Election of Directors 
(Resolutions 1 to 11) 
All of our current directors, other than Thomas W. Sidlik, who is retiring as of the Annual Meeting, are nominated for one-year terms to serve until the 2020 annual meeting, or until such director's earlier resignation, retirement or other termination of service. The Board extends its appreciation to Mr. Sidlik for his years of service, his many contributions and his thoughtful insight and advice. 
The Board has nominated Mr. Ortberg for election as a director. Mr. Ortberg joined the Board on September 13, 2018. In recruiting Mr. Ortberg, the Nominating and Governance Committee retained a search firm to help identify director prospects, perform candidate outreach, assist in reference and background checks, and provide other related services. The recruiting process typically involves either the search firm or a member of the Nominating and Governance Committee contacting a prospect to gauge his or her interest and availability. A candidate will then meet with several members of the Board. The Nominating and Governance Committee and the search firm will contact references for the prospect. A background check is completed before a final recommendation is made to the Board to appoint a candidate to the Board. 
The Board has been informed that each nominee is willing to continue to serve as a director. If a director does not receive a majority of the vote for his or her election, then that director will not be elected to the Board, and the Board may fill the vacancy with a different person, or the Board may reduce the number of directors to eliminate the vacancy. Each of Messrs. Donofrio, Frissora, Gupta, Mahoney and Zimmerman was a member of the Board prior to the Company's initial public offering in 2011, and information included in this Proxy Statement as to each member's tenure on our Board reflects that service. 
The Board believes that the combination of the various qualifications, skills, and breadth and depth of experiences of the director nominees contributes to an effective and well-functioning Board. The Board and the Nominating and Governance Committee believe that, individually and as a whole, the directors possess the necessary qualifications to provide effective oversight of the business and quality advice and counsel to the Company's management. 
Included in each director nominee's biography below is an assessment of each nominee's specific qualifications, attributes, skills and experience. Committee memberships listed below are as of the date of this Proxy Statement.

In order to help our shareholders better understand our Board practices, we are including the following description of current practices. The Nominating and Governance Committee ("Nom Gov Committee") regularly reviews these practices. 
Size of the Board 
As of the date of this mailing, the Board consists of 12 directors. Following the Annual Meeting and Mr. Sidlik's retirement, and assuming all nominated directors are elected, the Board will consist of 11 directors. Our Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that our Board must consist of a minimum of two directors. The exact number of directors will be determined from time to time by our full Board. 
Leadership Structure 
The Board believes it is important to retain flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the Chairman and CEO in a manner that is in the best interests of the Company. Currently, the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to separate the positions of CEO and Chairman and to have an independent Non-Executive Chairman. Rajiv L. Gupta was elected to this role on March 1, 2015. The Board believes this leadership structure affords the Company an effective combination of internal and external experience, continuity and independence, which serve the Board and the Company well. 
Director Independence 
The Board believes that a substantial majority of its members should be independent, non-employee directors. Mr. Clark, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is the only non-independent director. The current non-employee directors of the Company are Nancy E. Cooper, Frank J. Dellaquila, Nicholas M. Donofrio, Mark P. Frissora, Rajiv L. Gupta, Sean O. Mahoney, Robert K. Ortberg, Colin J. Parris, Ana G. Pinczuk, Thomas W. Sidlik and Lawrence A. Zimmerman. The Board has determined that all of its non-employee directors meet the requirements for independence under the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards. Furthermore, the Board limits membership on the Audit, Compensation and Human Resources, and Nominating and Governance Committees to independent directors. 
Audit Committee Financial Expert 
The Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and meet the independence rules required for Audit Committee members by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Messrs. Zimmerman and Dellaquila and Ms. Cooper met the qualifications of audit committee financial experts, as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Ms. Cooper serves on the audit committees of three additional public companies, and the Board has determined that such simultaneous service will not impair Ms. Cooper's ability to effectively serve on Aptiv's Audit Committee. 
Evaluation of Board Performance 
The Nom Gov Committee coordinates an annual evaluation process by which the directors evaluate the Board's and its Committees' performance and procedures. This self-evaluation leads to a full Board discussion of the results. Each Committee of the Board also conducts an annual evaluation of its performance and procedures, which culminates in a Committee discussion of the results.

Board Practices (continued) 
In addition, the Chairman conducts individual meetings with each director to obtain his or her assessment of director performance, Board dynamics and the effectiveness of the Board and its committees. These evaluations have consistently found that the Board and its committees are operating effectively, while identifying opportunities to improve the way the Board and its committees operate. 
Director Retirement 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the retirement age for directors is 75, unless waived by the Board. No director who is or would be over 75 at the expiration of his or her current term may be nominated to a new term, unless the Board waives the retirement age for the director. Once granted, such waiver must be renewed annually. The Board carefully considered the application of this policy with respect to Mr. Zimmerman, who is 76. Based upon the leadership value and strategic expertise he provides as Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committees, the Board authorized a waiver of the retirement age provided for in our Corporate Governance Guidelines to allow Mr. Zimmerman to serve one additional year. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that non-employee directors who significantly change their primary employment during their tenure as Board members must offer to tender their resignation to the Nom Gov Committee. The Nom Gov Committee will evaluate the continued appropriateness of Board membership under the new circumstances and make a recommendation to the Board as to any action to be taken with respect to such offer. 
Nomination of Directors 
The Nom Gov Committee recommends individuals for membership on the Board. The Nom Gov Committee considers a candidate's qualities and expertise, performance, personal characteristics, diversity (inclusive of age, gender, race and ethnicity) and professional responsibilities, and also reviews the composition of the Board relative to the long-term business strategy and the challenges and needs of the Board at that time. The Board is committed to searching for the best available candidates to fill vacancies and fully appreciates the value of diversity when evaluating prospective candidates. Ensuring the Board is composed of Directors who bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, exhibit a variety of skills, professional experience and backgrounds, and effectively represent the long-term interests of shareowners, is a top priority of the Board and the Nom Gov Committee. The Board as a whole is constituted to be strong in its collective knowledge and diversity of accounting and finance, management and leadership, vision and strategy, business operations, business judgment, technology, crisis management, risk assessment, industry knowledge, corporate governance and global markets. 
The Nom Gov Committee retains an independent executive search firm to help identify director prospects, perform candidate outreach, assist in reference and background checks, and provide other related services. The recruiting process typically involves either the search firm or a member of the Nom Gov Committee contacting a prospect to gauge his or her interest and availability. A candidate then meets with several members of the Board. The Nom Gov Committee and the search firm contacts references for the candidate, and a background check is completed before a final recommendation is made to the Board to appoint a candidate to the Board. 
The Nom Gov Committee views diversity in its broadest sense, including gender, race, ethnicity, experience, leadership qualities, education and age. The Nom Gov Committee will use the same selection process and criteria for evaluating all nominees, regardless of who submits the nominee for consideration. 
The Board's culture enables it to operate quickly and effectively in making key decisions. Board meetings are conducted in a collegial environment of trust, confidentiality, open dialogue, constructive commentary and mutual respect. 
In accordance with procedures set forth in our Memorandum and Articles of Association, shareholders holding at least ten percent of the ordinary shares outstanding and who have the right to vote at general meetings of the Company may propose, and the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider, nominees for election to the Board at the next annual meeting by giving timely written notice to the Corporate Secretary, which must be received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on March 5, 2020, and no earlier than November 26, 2019. The notice periods may change in accordance with the procedures set out in our Memorandum and Articles of Association. Any such notice must include the name of the nominee, a biographical sketch and resume, contact information and such other background materials as the Nominating and Governance Committee may request.

Board Practices (continued) 
Board Refreshment 
We believe that Board refreshment is critical as the Company's business strategy evolves. In the past three years, we have added five new independent directors, including three directors with extensive technology backgrounds. At the same time, we believe that we benefit from having several seasoned directors on our Board who are well-versed in the Company's business and help facilitate the transfer of institutional knowledge. We believe the average tenure for our independent directors of approximately five years reflects the balance the Board seeks between the perspectives brought by long-serving and new directors. 
Executive Sessions 
Independent directors meet in executive session each Board meeting, without the CEO or any other employees in attendance. The Chairman presides over each executive session of the Board. Each Committee meeting also includes an executive session at which Committee members meet without the CEO or any other employees in attendance. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board takes an active role in risk oversight related to the Company, both as a full Board and through its Committees, each of which has primary risk oversight responsibility with respect to all matters within the scope of its duties as contemplated by its charter. While the Company's management is responsible for day-to-day management of the various risks facing the Company, the Board is responsible for monitoring management's actions and decisions. Our Audit Committee regularly receives updates from management on risk-related matters and reports on these updates to our Board. These Committee reports provide our Board with insight about how Aptiv manages risk. In addition, our Board and Audit Committee regularly receives risk assessment reports from management that addresses and provides updates on key and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board, as apprised by the Audit Committee, determines that appropriate risk management and mitigation procedures are in place and that senior management takes the appropriate steps to manage all significant risks. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board believes that each director should hold a meaningful equity position in the Company, and it has established equity holding requirements for our non-employee directors. The holding requirement for each non-employee director is currently $500,000 in Aptiv shares. Each new director will have up to five full years from his or her date of appointment to fulfill this holding requirement. All current non-employee directors, other than Ms. Cooper and Mr. Ortberg, who joined the Board in 2018, and Mr. Dellaquila and Dr. Parris, who joined the Board in 2017, hold in excess of this minimum shareholding requirement. 
Governance Principles 
The Board adopted a formal statement of Corporate Governance Guidelines, which sets forth the corporate governance practices for Aptiv. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website at aptiv.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Governance Documents" under the heading "Governance." 
Code of Ethical Business Conduct 
Aptiv adopted a Code of Ethical Business Conduct, which applies to all employees and directors, including the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and controller, or persons performing similar functions. The Code of Ethical Business Conduct is available on Aptiv's website at aptiv.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Code of Conduct" under the heading "Governance." 
Copies of our Code of Ethical Business Conduct are also available to any shareholder who submits a request to the Corporate Secretary at Aptiv PLC, 5 Hanover Quay, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 2, Ireland. We intend to satisfy any disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K by posting on our website any amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of our Code of Ethical Business Conduct that applies to our directors or officers. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
Anyone who wishes to communicate with the Board or any individual member of the Board (or independent directors as a group) may do so by sending a letter addressed to the director or directors in care of the Corporate Secretary at Aptiv PLC, 5 Hanover Quay, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 2, Ireland. All correspondence, other than items such as junk mail that are unrelated to a director's duties and responsibilities, will be forwarded to the appropriate director or directors.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Our strategic, operational and financial performance over time is reflected in our results and returns to shareholders. This performance is shown in the following financial metrics and total shareholder return charts. We have aligned our 2018 performance-based annual and long-term incentive plans for executives with these metrics: 
Metric definitions: 
Adjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aptiv before discontinued operations, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. 
Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities from continuing operations plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses. 
Return on Net Assets is defined as tax-affected operating income [net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax expense, equity income (loss), net of tax, income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax], divided by average continuing operations net working capital plus average continuing operations net property, plant and equipment, measured each calendar year; not adjusted for restructuring expenses that are expected to provide future benefit to the Company. The decrease in return on net assets primarily reflects increased investments for revenue growth and increased profitability. 
Total Shareholder Return is measured by comparing the average closing price per share of the Company's ordinary shares for the specified trading days in the fourth quarter of the final year of the performance period to the average closing price per share of the Company's ordinary shares for the specified trading days in the fourth quarter of the year prior to the beginning of the performance period, including the reinvestment of dividends, relative to the companies in the Russell 3000 Auto Parts Index. 
Appendix A contains a reconciliation of these numbers to U.S. GAAP financial measures.

Executive Compensation Philosophy and Strategy 
General Philosophy in Establishing and Making Pay Decisions. Our executive compensation programs reflect our pay-for-performance philosophy and encourage executives to make sound decisions that drive short- and long-term shareholder value creation. The Compensation Committee utilizes a combination of fixed and variable pay elements in order to achieve the following objectives: 
Our goal for target total direct compensation (base salary, annual and long-term incentives) for our officers, including the NEOs, is to approximate the median (50th percentile) of our market. Compensation for individual roles may be positioned higher or lower than the market median where we believe it is appropriate, considering multiple factors such as each executive's roles and responsibilities, labor market dynamics, the individual's performance over time, and the experience and critical skills the individual may bring to his or her role with Aptiv. 
2018 Peer Group Analysis. We use a group of peer companies to compare NEO compensation to market. The Compensation Committee reviews and determines the composition of our peer group on an annual basis, considering input from its independent compensation consultant and management. 
In 2018, Aptiv's 2018 peer group consisted of the following companies, whose aggregate profile was comparable to Aptiv in terms of size, industry, operating characteristics and competition for executive talent. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Amphenol Corporation    Illinois Tool Works, Inc. 
 Autoliv, Inc.    Ingersoll-Rand plc 
 Corning Incorporated    Johnson Controls, Inc. 
 Cummins Inc.    Lear Corporation 
 Eaton Corporation    Rockwell Automation, Inc. 
 Emerson Electric Co.    TE Connectivity Ltd. 
 Fortive Corporation    Textron Inc. 
 Honeywell International Inc.    
[END TABLE]
Compared to the 2017 peer group, the 2018 peer group removed BorgWarner Inc., Danaher Corporation and Parker-
 Hannifin Corporation, and added Amphenol Corporation, Corning Incorporated, Fortive Corporation and Rockwell Automation, Inc. These changes, made in late 2017, were designed to reflect Aptiv's post-spin-off strategic direction and size. 
In 2018, target total direct compensation among our NEOs, on average, was positioned within a competitive range of the peer group median. Typically, we adjust compensation when we believe that there is a market or individual performance issue that should be addressed to preserve the best interests of the shareholders. 
For purposes of evaluating 2019 compensation decisions, with advice from its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee approved a change to the peer group, reducing the number of peer companies from 15 to 14. Autoliv, Inc. was removed from the peer group following its spin-off of its electronics segment, as the remaining company is no longer comparable in terms of size. 
2018 Shareholder Engagement. Aptiv has a philosophy of proactive engagement, communication, and transparency with shareholders. During 2018, members of management met with our investors to discuss our businesses, technologies, end markets, financial results and operational execution at numerous conferences and roadshows, in addition to Company-hosted events and quarterly conference calls. During 2018, we also continued to engage institutional shareholders with respect to our corporate governance and executive compensation practices. These outreach meetings, conducted by members of management, give us an opportunity to solicit feedback from our institutional shareholders on a variety of topics related to value creation, corporate governance, board recruitment and refreshment, and executive compensation. This feedback provides the Company with important insights, which management shares with the Board, with respect to shareholders' voting policies and priorities. We expect to continue to engage with shareholders on a regular basis to better understand and consider their views on our executive compensation programs and corporate governance practices. 
2018 Say-on-Pay. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, we received favorable support from approximately 97% of votes cast as to our named executive officers' compensation. Management and the Compensation Committee reviewed our shareholders' affirmative 2018 Say-on-Pay vote and believe it to be a strong indication of support for the Company's executive compensation program and pay-for-performance philosophy. Therefore, the Compensation Committee maintained the philosophy, compensation objectives and governing principles it has used in recent years

Overview of 2018 Executive Compensation 
We regularly undertake a comprehensive review of our business plan to identify strategic initiatives that should be linked to executive compensation. We also assess and review the level of risk in our company-wide compensation programs to ensure that they do not encourage imprudent risk-taking. 
Elements of Executive Compensation. In line with our executive compensation philosophy, for 2018, we provided the following primary elements of compensation to our officers, including the NEOs: 
Additional, non-primary elements of executive compensation, such as payments related to expatriate assignments or relocation, may be provided to a NEO from time to time. These elements that were provided to the NEOs for 2018 are reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "2018 Summary Compensation Table".

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
2018 Target Annual Total Direct Compensation Mix. Base salary and annual and long-term incentive award opportunities are the elements of our NEOs' total direct compensation. A majority of each NEO's total direct compensation opportunity is comprised of performance-based pay. Our annual incentive awards and the performance-based RSUs component of our long-term incentive awards are considered performance-based pay because the payout of these awards is dependent on the achievement of specified performance goals at Corporate, Segment and/or individual levels. The time-based portion of our RSU awards is retentive while also aligning with Company performance as the final value realized is based on the Company's share price. 
The significant proportion of performance-based pay aligns the interests of our NEO's with Aptiv's shareholders' interests. The mix of compensation for our CEO and other NEOs in 2018 is shown below: 
2018 Target Compensation Structure. The following table depicts 2018 target annual total direct compensation opportunities for the NEOs. However, this table does not include information regarding changes in pension value and non-qualified deferred compensation earnings or information regarding all other compensation, each as required to be presented in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" under the rules of the SEC. As such, this table should not be viewed as a substitute for the "2018 Summary Compensation Table."

2018 Annual Compensation Determination 
Individual base salaries and annual incentive targets for the NEOs are established based on the scope of each NEO's responsibilities, individual performance, experience and market pay data. At the beginning of each year, we also define key strategic objectives each NEO is expected to achieve during that year, which are then considered by the Committee when making final compensation determinations. 
2018 Base Salaries. Base salary is targeted at approximately the median of our peer group and is intended to reward and be commensurate with each NEO's responsibilities, individual performance and experience. Our practice is to make periodic adjustments to base salary, although we review compensation competitiveness annually. During 2018, certain of our NEOs received base salary adjustments. Generally, these adjustments were intended to increase the competitiveness of salary in comparison to market median. The following table summarizes the adjustments:

2018 Annual Incentive Plan Awards. Our Annual Incentive Plan is designed to motivate our NEOs to drive earnings, cash flow and profitable growth by measuring the NEOs' performance against our goals at the Corporate and relevant Segment levels. Historically, Annual Incentive Plan awards for our NEOs have been provided under the Aptiv Leadership Incentive Plan ("ALIP") so that these awards could potentially qualify for certain tax deductibility treatment under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 162(m)"). Given the changes to the U.S. tax code pursuant to U.S. federal tax reform legislation adopted in late 2017 (as further described below under "Tax and Accounting Considerations"), effective December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors terminated the ALIP. No new annual incentive award opportunities will be provided under the ALIP after December 31, 2018. However, any annual incentive award opportunities granted or settled under the ALIP with respect to periods commencing prior to December 31, 2018 (including the 2018 awards described below) will continue in effect in accordance with their terms and the applicable terms of the ALIP that would have applied had the ALIP not been terminated. 
For 2018, our NEOs' Annual Incentive Plan awards continued to be provided under the ALIP (but were not intended to qualify for tax deductibility as "qualified performance-based awards" under Section 162(m)). Our NEOs' 2018 ALIP awards were initially funded under a performance formula at 1% of Aptiv's net income, up to a maximum of $12 million per individual participant. The Company's adjusted net income for 2018 was $1.396 billion; thus the maximum funding for payouts to each participant under the 2018 ALIP, subject to the Compensation Committee's exercise of negative discretion, was approved at the $12 million maximum. The Compensation Committee then used negative discretion to determine final payouts under the ALIP to reflect the performance against the goals identified under the Annual Incentive Plan. 
The Compensation Committee establishes the individual annual incentive target for each NEO at approximately the median of our peer group, but such target can be adjusted based on the NEO's position, individual performance, and the size and scope of his or her responsibilities. Final payouts based on the financial metrics described below can range from 0% to 200% of each NEO's annual incentive target. 
The Compensation Committee, working with management and its independent compensation consultant, sets the underlying performance metrics and objectives for the preliminary annual incentive plan payout levels based on Aptiv's annual business objectives. For 2018, each NEO's award payout was determined as follows:

[END TABLE]
For purposes of using negative discretion under the ALIP to determine preliminary NEO payouts, the NI / OI and CFBF /SOCF goals and the award payout levels related to the achievement of those goals were measured on a performance scale set by the Compensation Committee. Performance below the minimum threshold for a metric results in no payout for that metric, and performance above the maximum level for a metric is capped at a maximum total payout of 200% of the target with respect to that metric. For the NI /OI and CFBF /SOCF metrics the threshold, target and maximum payout levels were 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively. New Business Bookings is treated differently than the NI /OI and CFBF /SOCF metrics. If the New Business Bookings targets are achieved, the target payout for that metric is paid. If the New Business Bookings targets are not achieved, no amount is paid for the New Business Bookings portion of the award. 
The 2018 performance targets by metric were:

Our Annual Incentive Plan target goals, approved by the Compensation Committee, are established to reflect our focus on growth over prior year actual outcomes, and above market growth in the performance period. With respect to the performance levels required for target payment, 2018 overall performance at the Corporate level produced a below-target payout of 87%. Performance at the Segment level varied, with overall performance for Signal and Power Solutions resulting in a payout at 75% and Advanced Safety and User Experience resulting in a payout at 91%.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued) 
Following the determination of payout levels for the Corporate and Segment metrics, the Compensation Committee, in conjunction with the CEO, assessed the other NEOs' performance with respect to the Strategic Results Modifiers ("SRM") and individual qualitative performance. The CEO did not participate in the assessment of his own performance and he was not eligible for an SRM payout. 
As part of our focus on strategic priorities, the SRM was approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the year as part of the Annual Incentive Plan design. The SRM can range, in the aggregate, from plus or minus 10% of the total Annual Incentive Plan target opportunity. The SRM allows the Compensation Committee to consider strategic factors in addition to the financial metrics under the Annual Incentive Plan. The SRM is determined based on a qualitative performance assessment and recommendation by the CEO as to each other NEO's achievement of SRM objectives, with final approval by the Compensation Committee. For 2018, the focus areas of the SRM were:

[END TABLE]
In determining the final individual payouts, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the CEO (except related to his own performance and payout), evaluated each eligible NEO's qualitative performance in relation to the specific Segment and overall Corporate performance, as applicable. Each NEO was also evaluated based on his individual achievements. The material qualitative performance achievements considered by the Compensation Committee included: for Mr. Clark, his leadership and performance with a sustainable business model and positioning the Company for continued success, his commitment to a long-term financial framework, and his continued focus on operational efficiency and execution, driving SG&A benefits and reinvesting in the development of advanced technologies; for Mr. Massaro, his leadership and performance in 2018 including execution of the business strategy and disciplined, balanced capital deployment, focused on value enhancing organic and inorganic investment opportunities; for Mr. Sherbin, his leadership and performance in legal and compliance initiatives; and for Messrs. Abulaban and Paja, their leadership and performance in their Segments, including strong 2018 operating and financial results despite macro headwinds, and record full year new business awards. Final award payout percentages ranged from 87% to 95% of target for our NEOs. 
As a result of the analysis described above, the Compensation Committee approved the following 2018 annual incentive award payments for the NEOs:

2018 Long-Term Compensation Determination 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards. Aptiv's Long-Term Incentive Plan is designed to reward performance on long-term strategic metrics and to attract, retain and motivate participants. 
Our annual equity awards include both performance-based and time-based RSUs. The time-based RSUs, which make up 25% of the NEOs' long-term awards, generally vest ratably over three years, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. The performance-based RSUs, which make up 75% of the NEOs' long-term awards, are settled after the results of a three-year performance period are determined. The 2018 grant vests at the end of 2020 and will be settled in early 2021 after the outcomes of the performance period are determined and approved. Each NEO may receive from 0% to 200% of his target performance-based RSU award as determined by Aptiv's performance against the following company-wide performance metrics:

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Average Return on Net Assets is tax-affected operating income divided by average  net working capital plus average net property, plant and equipment for each calendar year, as adjusted for incentive plan calculation purposes.  
(2)  Relative TSR is measured by comparing the average closing price per share of the Company's ordinary shares for all  available trading days in December of 2020 to the average closing price per share of the Company's ordinary shares for all available trading days in December of 2017, including the reinvestment of dividends, relative to the companies in Russell  3000 Auto Parts Index.

The Long-Term Incentive Plan allows for dividend equivalents to accrue on unvested RSUs; however, the dividend equivalents vest and pay out only if and to the extent that the underlying RSUs vest and pay out.

2018 Grants. The Compensation Committee established the following 2018 target long-term incentive awards for our NEOs (consisting of time-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs, as described above), taking into account scope of responsibilities, individual performance, retention considerations and market compensation data, in early 2018: 
In addition, Mr. Massaro and Mr. Sherbin received grants in the amount of $400,000 and $200,000, respectively, in recognition of their contributions with respect to the spin-off of Delphi Technologies. 
The target annual award approved by the Compensation Committee differs from the amounts disclosed in the "Stock Awards" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table because of the different methodologies used to calculate the value of the award. With respect to the CEO, the differences in value attributable to the valuation methodologies are shown below:

2016-2018 Performance-Based RSUs. In February 2019, we paid out the performance-based RSUs for the 2016-2018 performance period. The performance targets were established prior to the Board of Directors' approval of the spin-off of Delphi Technologies PLC, which was completed on December 4, 2017. In order to evaluate Aptiv's financial performance against the established targets in consideration of the spin-off, for purposes of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, certain adjustments were made to the Company's financial results from continuing operations in order to reflect the performance achieved during the performance period, as permitted pursuant to the Long-Term Incentive Plan. 
The following tables set forth: (1) the threshold, target and maximum levels, as well as the actual level achieved, for each performance metric; and (2) for each NEO, the target total number of performance-based RSUs and actual number of performance-based RSUs earned.

In 2015, Mr. Abulaban was granted a "continuity" equity award, fifty percent of which was comprised of time-based RSUs and fifty percent of which was comprised of performance-based RSUs. In December 2018, we settled the time-based RSUs. In February 2019, we settled the performance-based RSUs. The performance metric for these RSUs was relative TSR during the four-year performance period. The maximum achievement level for these performance-based RSUs was 200% of target, plus any dividend equivalents accrued. Relative TSR was achieved at the 65th percentile resulting in a payout at 138% of target. The following table sets forth the threshold, target and maximum relative TSR levels and the total number of performance-based RSUs available to be earned by Mr. Abulaban based on such levels of performance:

As noted above, equitable adjustments were made to the Company's equity awards that were outstanding at the time of the spin-off.

Other Compensation 
Additional compensation and benefit programs available to our NEOs are described below. Only those benefits and policies offered to the other salaried employee populations are available to our NEOs. 
Salaried Retirement Savings Program ("SRSP"). Along with other eligible U.S. Aptiv salaried employees and executives, our eligible NEOs participate in our broad-based and tax-qualified defined contribution plan, the SRSP, which is a qualified plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). All contributions are subject to any contribution limits imposed by the Code. 
Salaried Retirement Equalization Savings Program ("SRESP"). Under the SRESP, eligible U.S. employees receive Aptiv contributions in excess of the limits imposed upon the SRSP by the Code. No guaranteed or above-market rates are earned; the investment options available are a subset of those available to all employees under the SRSP. Additional details regarding benefits and payouts under this plan are provided in the "Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" section. 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Program ("SERP"). The SERP was frozen (for purposes of credited service and compensation calculations) in 2008, as described further under the "Pension Benefits" section. Only Messrs. Abulaban and Sherbin are eligible for the SERP. 
Severance Plans. In 2017, we adopted the Aptiv PLC Executive Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") and the Aptiv PLC Executive Change in Control Severance Plan (the "Change in Control Plan"). The plans were adopted to provide severance protections to certain executives who are designated by the Compensation Committee as eligible to participate in each plan, including certain of the NEOs. 
For the eligible NEOs, the Severance Plan generally provides for severance benefits in the event of a "qualifying separation" (as defined in the Severance Plan to include a termination without "cause" or a resignation for "good reason") of the NEO's employment. Pursuant to the Severance Plan, an NEO who incurs a qualifying separation would be entitled to receive generally severance payments equal in the aggregate to a multiple of annual base salary (1.5X for officers with at least two years of service, and 1X for all other officers), unless and until the NEO is employed by another employer. The Severance Plan also provides a COBRA subsidy for a period of up to 18 months following a qualifying separation. 
The Change in Control Plan generally provides for severance benefits in connection with a "qualifying separation" (as defined in the Change in Control Plan to include a termination without "cause" or a resignation for "good reason") that occurs in connection with or within two years after a Change in 
 Control (as defined in the Change in Control Plan). Pursuant to the Change in Control Plan, an NEO who incurs a qualifying separation would be entitled to receive generally a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of (1) three times base salary in the case of the CEO and two times base salary in the case of an NEO other than the CEO, and (2) in the case of the CEO, three times the higher of the CEO's target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the year in which the separation occurs or in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control (or in the case of an NEO other than the CEO, two times the higher of the NEO's target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the year in which the separation occurs or in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control). In addition, an NEO who incurs a qualifying separation is also entitled to receive a lump sum payment representing the sum of 36 monthly COBRA premiums for the CEO and 24 monthly COBRA premiums for NEOs other than the CEO. 
Benefits under the Severance Plan and the Change in Control Plan are generally subject to execution by the NEO of a general waiver and release of claims in favor of Aptiv. 
Other Benefits. We provide additional benefits, such as relocation and expatriate benefits to our NEOs, when applicable, and in general, these benefits are the same as those provided to similarly situated non-officer employees. The primary expatriate benefits include housing allowance, transportation allowance and tax equalization in home and host country. Additional details are covered in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table". 
Governance Practices 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. To support better alignment of our executives' interests with those of our shareholders, Aptiv's Board believes that our officers should maintain an appropriate level of equity interest in Aptiv. To that end, our Board has adopted the following stock ownership guidelines: 
In 2017, as part of the review of stock ownership guidelines, the Board increased the amount of Aptiv shares that the CEO is required to hold, from a minimum of five times his base salary to a minimum of six times his base salary. Our officers, including the NEOs, are expected to fulfill the ownership requirement within five years from the time they are appointed to their position. Until such time as the required

 holding is met, officers may not sell stock, subject to limited exceptions. Once the ownership requirement has been met, an officer may sell stock, provided, however, that the minimum ownership requirement must continue to be met. The Compensation Committee reviews the ownership level for covered executives each year. As of the 2018 measurement of ownership, all of the NEOs were above the applicable ownership requirement. 
Clawback. As a matter of policy, if our financial statements are materially misstated or in material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under securities laws, then the Compensation Committee will review the circumstances and determine if any participants should forfeit certain future awards or repay prior payouts. If the misstatement is due to fraud, then the participants responsible for the fraud will forfeit their rights to future awards and must repay any amounts they received from prior awards due to the fraudulent behavior. The Compensation Committee expects to update our clawback policy, as appropriate, to comply with the requirements for clawbacks under the final provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange. 
Restrictive Covenants. All executives, including the NEOs, are required to sign confidentiality and non-interference agreements in order to participate in the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The non-interference agreements include non-compete and non-solicitation covenants, which generally prohibit executives from: 
If the terms of the confidentiality and non-interference agreements are violated, Aptiv has the right to cancel or rescind any final Long-Term Incentive Plan award, consistent with applicable law. 
No Excise Tax Gross-Ups. We do not provide any excise tax gross-ups specific to our officer population. Certain expatriate policy and relocation provisions, applicable to all salaried employees, allow for tax gross-ups as reimbursement for additional taxes or expenses incurred due to expatriate status or relocation expenses. 
No Hedging/No Pledging. The Company prohibits its directors, officers and employees from engaging in transactions having the effect of hedging the unvested portion of any equity or equity-linked award. In addition, the Company prohibits its directors, officers and employees from purchasing Company securities on margin or holding Company securities in a margin account. The Company also prohibits its directors, officers and employees from pledging the Company's securities as collateral for a loan. The Company's Policy Prohibiting Insider Trading is available on Aptiv.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Governance Documents" under the heading "Governance." 
Independent Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee retains Compensation Advisory Partners LLC ("CAP") as its independent compensation consultant. The scope of the work done by CAP during 2018 for the Compensation Committee included the following: 
The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of CAP pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent CAP from independently representing the Compensation Committee. CAP does not perform other services for the Company, and will not do so without the prior consent of the Chair of the Compensation Committee. CAP meets with the Compensation Committee Chair and the Compensation Committee outside the presence of management. In addition, CAP participates in all of the Compensation Committee's meetings and, when requested by the Compensation Committee Chair, in the preparatory meetings and the executive sessions. 
Compensation Risk Assessment. Pay Governance, an independent executive compensation consulting firm, conducted a risk assessment of our compensation programs in January 2019 and concluded that our compensation policies, practices and programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Aptiv. Pay Governance's assessment included a review of our pay and incentive plan structures, pay practices and policies and

 governance process, including the Compensation Committee's oversight of such programs (supported by an independent consultant) and interviews with executives representing Accounting, Finance, HR and Internal Audit. 
The Compensation Committee and CAP reviewed the 2019 assessment and discussed the report with management. The Compensation Committee agreed that our compensation policies, practices and programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Aptiv. In doing so, the Compensation Committee also reaffirmed the following key risk mitigating factors with respect to our NEOs: 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
In designing our compensation and benefit programs, the Compensation Committee generally considers the accounting implications of its decisions, including the accounting treatment of amounts awarded or paid to our officers. Section 162(m) generally limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers (and, beginning for 2018, certain former executive officers) to $1 million in any taxable year. Historically, an exception was available for compensation that qualifies as "performance-based" within the meaning of Section 162(m), but the exception has now been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless certain transition relief for certain compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 is available. 
It has been our historical policy (prior to 2018) to structure certain compensation arrangements with our executive officers to potentially qualify as performance-based so as to potentially maximize the tax deductibility of that compensation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; however, there have been cases where the benefit of such tax deductibility was outweighed by the need for flexibility or the attainment of other objectives. Furthermore, incentive compensation opportunities provided in 2018 were not intended to qualify for the previously-available performance-based exception due to 2017 tax reform legislation. Even if the Compensation Committee has intended in the past to grant compensation that qualifies for the performance-based exception, Aptiv cannot guarantee that such compensation will so qualify or ultimately will be deductible. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
We, the undersigned members of the Compensation Committee, have reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on such review and discussion, we recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

PENSION BENEFITS 
Certain executives, including Messrs. Abulaban and Sherbin, are eligible to receive benefits under the SERP. 
The SERP is a supplemental executive defined benefit plan, which was frozen on September 30, 2008. As a result of the freeze, no new benefits have accrued and no new participants have been allowed to join the plan. This plan is a non-qualified and unfunded defined benefit plan that supplemented the benefits of an underlying qualified defined benefit pension plan assumed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") in July 2009. 
Eligibility 
To qualify for participation in the SERP, eligible executives must meet both of the following requirements: 
To receive benefits under the SERP: 
Service is credited as of December 31, 2006. The benefit will be paid out in the form of a five-year annuity. 
Valuation Method and Assumptions 
The actuarial present value of accumulated benefits for the SERP shown in the 2018 Pension Benefits table is based on benefits accrued as of September 30, 2008, the last day on which benefits were accumulated under the former Delphi Corporation's qualified plan. The amounts reflect the method and assumptions used in calculating our pension liability under U.S. GAAP as of that date, except that each participant is assumed to remain actively employed until age 62. 
The present value figures shown are estimates only; actual benefit amounts will be based on the age, interest rates, mortality rates and other circumstances in effect upon the actual termination of employment or death of the participant. 
The following table sets forth information regarding benefits provided to and years of service credited to eligible NEOs under the SERP.

The SRESP deferral election process is conducted prior to the year in which eligible income is earned. For the 2018 plan, deferral elections were required to be made by December 2017. During this process, eligible employees were allowed to make deferral elections related to their 2018 base salary and any annual incentive award based on 2018 performance that would be scheduled to be paid in 2019 (but no later than March 15, 2019). 
Distributions 
Eligible employees must also elect a distribution date for their deferred amounts. A base salary deferral must remain deferred for a minimum of one year, and any annual incentive deferral must remain deferred for a minimum of two years. 
Vesting 
All employee deferrals and Aptiv contributions are immediately vested. 
The values displayed in the table below include contributions to the NEOs' SRESP accounts by the NEOs and by Aptiv in 2018, as well as the aggregate balances of these accounts at the end of 2018.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON 
TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Employment Arrangements 
We have offer letters in place with all Aptiv NEOs. These offer letters describe our standard terms and conditions of employment and compensation and benefits provided to the individual. Mr. Clark's offer letter also includes severance provisions, which provide for 18 months of base pay plus 1.5 times annual incentive at target in the event he is terminated by the Company without cause. 
Each executive who participates in the annual Long-Term Incentive Plan equity grant must sign a grant agreement, as well as a non-interference and confidentiality agreement, described above in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section. The non-interference agreement includes both non-compete and non-solicitation covenants. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
In the event of a change in control, each executive's annual incentive target award will be prorated for the time period between the plan start date and the effective change in control date. A payment will also be calculated for that time period based on actual performance and compared to the prorated target, with the executive receiving the larger of the two values. Payment of the award will be made by March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which a change in control occurs. 
A change in control under the annual incentive plan occurs if any of the following events occur: 
If involuntarily terminated without "Cause" as defined below, each executive, including the NEOs, will also be eligible for a prorated portion of his or her annual incentive award. The period used to determine the prorated award will be the beginning of the performance period to the individual's termination date. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
An equity award must be outstanding for one year in order to receive any benefit at termination. Upon a voluntary resignation from Aptiv (other than for good reason), including retirement, except as described below for Mr. Clark, any time-based RSUs that have not vested will be canceled. Upon a termination without cause, for good reason or due to death or disability, the time-based RSUs will be prorated over the period between the grant date and termination date. Any unvested pro-rata awards will be delivered at the next scheduled vesting date. 
Upon a termination without cause, for good reason or due to retirement, death or disability, any outstanding performance-based RSUs will be prorated over the period between the grant date and termination date. The final performance payout will be determined based on actual performance at the end of the performance period and shares will be distributed at the time of the general distribution. 
If an executive voluntarily departs (with the exception of the retirement and good reason provisions discussed above) or is terminated for cause, or in the event of any termination prior to the first anniversary of the grant date, all outstanding unvested equity awards will be canceled. 
"Cause" is defined in the Long-Term Incentive Plan as: 
"Good Reason" is defined in the Long-Term Incentive Plan as:

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control (continued) 
Upon a qualifying termination within two years after a change in control, or upon a change in control if a replacement award is not provided, outstanding unvested equity awards will vest as follows: 
A replacement award is an award with respect to the stock of Aptiv or its successor that is at least equal in value to the outstanding award, is a publicly traded security and has no less favorable terms than the outstanding award. A qualifying termination after a change in control includes any termination by Aptiv without cause, or by the NEO for good reason, or due to death or disability. 
Change in Control Plan 
The Change in Control Plan generally provides for severance benefits in connection with a "qualifying separation" (as defined in the Change in Control Plan to include a termination without "cause" or a resignation for "good reason") that occurs in connection with or within two years after a Change in Control (as defined in the Change in Control Plan). Pur-
 suant to the Change in Control Plan, an NEO who incurs a qualifying separation would be entitled to receive generally a lump sum cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of (1) three times base salary in the case of the CEO and two times base salary in the case of an NEO other than the CEO, and (2) in the case of the CEO, three times the higher of the CEO's target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the year in which the separation occurs or in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control (or in the case of an NEO other than the CEO, two times the higher of the NEO's target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the year in which the separation occurs or in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control). In addition, an NEO who incurs a qualifying separation is also entitled to receive a lump sum payment representing the sum of 36 monthly COBRA premiums for the CEO and 24 monthly COBRA premiums for NEOs other than the CEO. 
Severance Plan 
For the eligible NEOs, the Severance Plan generally provides for severance benefits in the event of a "qualifying separation" (as defined in the Severance Plan to include a termination without "cause" or a resignation for "good reason") of the NEO's employment. Pursuant to the Severance Plan, an NEO who incurs a qualifying separation would be entitled to receive generally severance payments equal in the aggregate to a multiple of annual base salary (1.5X for officers with at least two years of service, and 1X for all other officers), unless and until the NEO is employed by another employer. The Severance Plan also provides to eligible U.S. employees a COBRA subsidy for a period of up to 18 months following a qualifying separation.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control (continued) 
As required by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, all NEOs who have elected to participate in the SRESP must wait six months to receive a payment under the plan by reason of termination of employment. Payments for departure on December 31, 2018 would be made within 60 days after July 1, 2019. All amounts are estimates only, and actual amounts will vary depending upon the facts and circumstances applicable at the time of the triggering event. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
Aptiv is a global company employing approximately 143,000 employees in 44 countries, as of December 31, 2018. We refer to the employee who received the median of the annual cash compensation of all of our employees (other than Mr. Clark), as the "Median Employee." The Median Employee was identified by using a consistently applied compensation measure of cash compensation, as further described below, for the period beginning on January 1, 2018, and ending on December 31, 2018. All full-time, part-time, and temporary employees of Aptiv and its consolidated subsidiaries as of October 31, 2018, were included. The employees considered did not include any independent contractors or "leased" workers. The compensation for any employee who was hired after January 1, 2018 (other than temporary employees) was annualized for 2018. We did not use any statistical sampling or cost-of-living adjustments for purposes of this pay ratio disclosure. 
The cash compensation used in the analysis consisted of base salary or regular wages, premium pay (including but not limited to overtime, holiday pay, and shift differential), and incentive pay. This definition of cash compensation was chosen because we believe it is a compensation measure that provides an accurate depiction of total earnings, and can be applied consistently across the globe. 
After identifying the Median Employee using the methodology described above, we calculated annual total compensation for the Median Employee using the same methodology as compensation reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. The Median Employee's annual total compensation is $5,414. When compared to our CEO's annual total compensation of $14,123,103, the ratio of the total annual compensation of our CEO to the total annual compensation of our Median Employee was approximately 2,609:1.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" or incorporated by reference in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Zimmerman (Chairman) and Dellaquila, and Ms. Cooper and Ms. Pinczuk. All of the members of the Audit Committee are independent directors under the NYSE listing standards and the rules of the SEC. In addition, the Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are financially literate under the NYSE listing standards and that each of Messrs. Zimmerman and Dellaquila and Ms. Cooper qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules of the SEC. 
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which is evaluated annually. The charter of the Audit Committee is available on Aptiv's website at aptiv.com by clicking on the tab "Investors" and then the caption "Governance Documents" under the heading "Governance." 
The Audit Committee selects, evaluates and, where deemed appropriate, replaces Aptiv's independent registered public accounting firm. As part of the evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, the independent registered public accounting firm's global capabilities and independent registered public accounting firm's technical expertise and knowledge of the Company's global operations and industry. In connection with the mandated rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee is directly involved in the selection of the new lead engagement partner. The Audit Committee also pre-approves all audit services, engagement fees and terms, and all permitted non-audit engagements, except as otherwise prohibited under applicable law. 
Management is responsible for Aptiv's internal controls and the financial reporting process. Aptiv's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of Aptiv's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
In this context, the Audit Committee has reviewed Aptiv's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and has met and held discussions with management and Ernst & Young LLP ("EY"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Management represented to the Audit Committee that Aptiv's consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The discussions between the Audit Committee and EY included the matters required to be discussed by Rules on Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, and Related and Transitional Amendments to PCAOB Standards. 
The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and letter from EY required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding EY's communications with the Audit Committee concerning its independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with EY the accounting firm's independence. 
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and EY and the Audit Committee's review of the representation of management and the report of EY to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Aptiv's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC. 
The Audit Committee also considered whether non-audit services provided by EY during 2018 were compatible with maintaining their independence and concluded that such non-audit services did not affect their independence.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM'S FEES 
The Audit Committee has a policy concerning the approval of audit and non-audit services to be provided by Aptiv's independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit services and all permitted non-audit services (including fees and terms thereof), except as otherwise prohibited pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. For each proposed service, the Audit Committee reviews a description of the service and sufficient information to confirm the determination that the provision of such service will not impair the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. The Chairman of the Audit Committee is authorized to grant such pre-approvals in the event there is a need for such approvals prior to the next full Audit Committee meeting, provided all such pre-approvals are then reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, EY provided various audit, audit-related, tax and other services to Aptiv. The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit services, audit-related, tax and other services provided by EY in 2018 and 2017. The following table presents fees for professional services charged by EY by type and amount for fiscal years 2018 and 2017:

APPOINTMENT OF AND PAYMENT TO AUDITORS 
(Resolution 12) 
The Audit Committee of our Board has appointed EY as our auditors. Shareholders are requested to reappoint EY as the Company's auditors for the period ending with the Annual Meeting of the Company to be held in 2020. Shareholders are also requested to authorize the directors to determine the fees to be paid to the auditors. Shareholders are also requested to ratify the appointment of EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for purposes of United States securities law reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
A representative of EY will be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if the firm desires and to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" the re-appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our auditors, to ratify their appointment as our independent registered public accounting firm and to authorize the directors to determine the fees to be paid to the auditors. 
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
(Resolution 13) 
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are providing shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory, non-binding vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to align executive and shareholder interests by reinforcing the long-term growth, value creation and sustainability of Aptiv and to ensure that the majority of compensation opportunities are a result of pay-for-performance. 
The Company is presenting Resolution 13, which gives shareholders the opportunity to approve or not approve our compensation program for NEOs by voting for or against the following resolution (a "say-on-pay" vote). While the vote on the resolution is advisory in nature and therefore will not bind us to take any particular action, the Board intends to carefully consider the shareholder vote resulting from the proposal in making future decisions regarding the Company's compensation programs. 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Proxy Statement pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation disclosure rules, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and narrative discussion." 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, on an advisory, non-binding basis.

RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The Board has adopted a written Related Party Transaction Policy. Pursuant to this policy, the Company's executive officers, directors and nominees for director must promptly disclose any actual or potential material conflict of interest to our General Counsel, who will then assess and communicate the information to the Nominating and Governance Committee for evaluation and appropriate resolution. The Nominating and Governance Committee will generally not approve or ratify a related party transaction unless it has determined that, upon consideration of all relevant information, the related party transaction is in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. If we become aware of an existing related party transaction that has not been pre-approved under our Related Party Transaction Policy, the transaction will be referred to the Nominating and Governance Committee, which will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction. 
No reportable related party transactions were identified during 2018.

OTHER INFORMATION 
Presentation of Accounts 
Under Jersey law, the directors are required to present the accounts of the Company and the reports of the auditors before shareholders at a general meeting. Therefore, the accounts of the Company for the fiscal year ended December  31, 2018 will be presented to the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. 
Other Business 
Management is not aware of any other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting, except those set forth in this Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If other business is properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the proxies will be voted by the persons named therein in accordance with their judgment on such matters. 
Shareholder Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
To be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy statement, shareholder proposals submitted in accordance with the SEC's rules must be received by our Corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on November 12, 2019, 120 days before the one-year anniversary of the mailing date. 
If you wish to bring a matter before a general meeting outside the process described above, you may do so by following the procedures set forth in the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
The rules of the SEC require our directors, executive officers and holders of more than ten percent (10%) of ordinary shares to file reports of stock ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based on the Section 16 reports filed by our directors and executive officers, and written representations of our directors and executive officers, we believe there were no late filings for transactions occurring during 2018. 
Householding 
Only one copy of each of our annual report to shareholders and this Proxy Statement have been sent to multiple share-
 holders who share the same address and last name, unless we have received contrary instructions from one or more of those shareholders. This procedure is referred to as "householding." We have been notified that certain intermediaries (brokers or banks) will also household proxy materials. We will deliver promptly, upon oral or written request, separate copies of the annual report and proxy statement to any shareholder at the same address. If you wish to receive separate copies of one or both of these documents, or if you do not wish to participate in householding in the future, you may write to our Corporate Secretary at Aptiv PLC, 5 Hanover Quay, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin 2, Ireland, or call (248) 813-2000. You may contact your broker or bank to make a similar request. Shareholders sharing an address who now receive multiple copies of our annual report and proxy statement may request delivery of a single copy of each document by writing or calling us at the address or telephone number above or by contacting their broker or bank (provided the broker or bank has determined to household proxy materials). 
Record Date 
Shareholders owning Aptiv ordinary shares at the close of business on February 28, 2019 (the record date) may vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. On that date, 257,899,322 ordinary shares were outstanding. Each Ordinary Share is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. 
Voting prior to the Annual Meeting 
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by proxy in any of the following ways: 
By Internet or Telephone - If you have Internet or telephone access, you may authorize the submission of a proxy on your behalf by following the voting instructions in the materials you receive. If you vote by Internet or telephone, you should not return your proxy card. 
By Mail - You may vote by mail by completing, dating and signing your proxy card and mailing it in the envelope provided. You must sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example, as officer of a corporation, guardian, executor, trustee or custodian), you must indicate your name and title or capacity. 
If you vote over the Internet or by telephone, your vote must be received by 3:00 a.m., Central Time, on April 23, 2019.

Other Information (continued) 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name." The street name holder will provide you with instructions that you must follow in order to have your shares voted. 
Changing Your Vote before the Annual Meeting 
If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy before it is exercised by: 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your brokerage firm, bank or other holder of record. 
Voting at the Annual Meeting 
If you are a shareholder of record, you may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting or you may be represented by another person at the Annual Meeting by executing a proxy designating that person. 
If you hold your shares in street name and you wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy issued in your name from the street name holder. 
Quorum for the Annual Meeting 
A quorum will consist of one or more shareholders present in person or by proxy who hold or represent shares of not less than a majority of the total voting rights of all of the shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Voting Tabulation 
To be approved, Resolutions 1 to 12 require a simple majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in favor of each Resolution, assuming a quorum has been met. If a director does not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her election, then that director will not be elected to the Board, and the Board may fill the vacancy with a different person, or the Board may reduce the number of directors to eliminate the vacancy. The vote on Resolution 13 is advisory and is not binding on our Board or the Company. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for the purpose of determining a quorum, but are not counted as votes cast. 
Broker Non-Votes 
A broker non-vote occurs when the broker that holds your shares in street name is not entitled to vote on a matter without instruction from you and you do not give any instruction. Unless instructed otherwise by you, brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote on any matter other than Resolution 12 (Appointment of and Payment to Auditors), which is considered to be "routine" for these purposes. It is important that you cast your vote for your shares to be represented on all matters. 
Attending the Annual Meeting 
If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you must present proof that you own Aptiv shares to be admitted. 
Record Shareholders. If you are a record shareholder (a person who owns shares registered directly in his or her name with Computershare, Aptiv's transfer agent) and plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please indicate this when voting, either by marking the attendance box on the proxy card or responding affirmatively when prompted during telephone or Internet voting. 
Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. Beneficial owners of Aptiv ordinary shares held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letters from the broker, bank or other nominee are examples of proof of ownership. If your shares are held in street name and you want to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a written proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee holding your shares. 
Accessing Proxy Materials on the Internet 
This Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K are available at aptiv.com. If you received a printed copy of our proxy materials, you may choose to receive future proxy materials by email. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by email will lower our costs of delivery and is beneficial for the environment. If you choose to receive our future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to view those proxy materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it or for so long as the email address provided by you is valid.

We have engaged Morrow Sodali LLC ("Morrow") at 470 West Avenue, Stamford, CT 06902 to assist with the solicitation of proxies. We will pay Morrow an aggregate fee, including reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, of $12,000, depending on the level of services actually provided. Certain Aptiv employees, officers and directors may also solicit proxies by mail, telephone or personal visits. They will not receive any additional compensation for their services. 
We will also reimburse brokers, banks and other nominees for their expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.
