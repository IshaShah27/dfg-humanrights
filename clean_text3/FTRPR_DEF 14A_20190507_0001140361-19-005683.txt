 Frontier Communications Corporation   2   2019 Proxy Statement  
[END TABLE]
PROXY SUMMARY      
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Establish clear alignment between the interests of our executives and those of our stockholders by rewarding performance measured by key financial metrics, strategic objectives and relative total stockholder return, and through the use of long-term incentive awards as a significant component of annual compensation.      Reinforce our performance culture for our Named Executive Officers (NEOs) by making a majority of their compensation at risk, i.e., contingent upon achievement of specified company and individual performance goals.      Hire and retain talented executives by having a compensation program that is competitive in relation to comparable companies based on size, overall complexity and the nature of our business.      Ensure company goals are fully aligned throughout the organization. Each year, we establish company-wide goals to achieve Frontier's business plan for the year. Our NEOs are compensated to the extent they are successful in leading Frontier to achieve these goals for each year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Frontier believes that our compensation program is a sound reflection of our compensation philosophy and, as such, our Board recommends that stockholders vote FOR our 2019 Say-On-Pay proposal.

 What We Do  
 ✔    Employ a pay-for-performance executive compensation program whereby over 80% of NEO compensation for 2018 was at risk.  
 ✔    Pay a majority of compensation in the form of long-term incentive awards to defer a portion of pay based on future company performance and tie compensation payout levels to our stock performance along with providing a retention incentive to continue leading our company.  
 ✔    Use multipliers to reward above-target performance and reduce short-term and long-term incentive payouts for below-target performance.  
 ✔    Require our executives to own Frontier stock equal to a multiple of base salary. For our CEO, this multiple is five times base salary.  
 ✔    Use double-trigger change-in-control severance arrangements.  
 ✔    Hold an annual stockholder vote on our executive compensation program.  
 ✔    Have a recoupment, or clawback, policy to recover both cash and equity compensation from executives, including in the case of misconduct that results in a restatement of our financial statements.  
 ✔    Regularly analyze risks related to our compensation program and conduct a broad risk assessment annually.  
 ✔    Engage an independent compensation consultant to provide advice to our Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We Don't Do  
    Permit our executives to hedge or pledge Frontier stock.  
    Reward our executives with perquisites or tenure-based benefits, such as retiree medical benefits, in the ordinary course.  
    Pay dividends on unearned performance shares.  
    Make tax "gross-ups" for severance payments.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION      
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Maintain clear alignment between the interests of our executives and those of our stockholders by rewarding performance measured by key financial metrics, strategic objectives and relative TSR and through the use of long-term incentive awards as a significant component of compensation.     Reinforce our performance culture for our NEOs by making a majority of their compensation at risk, i.e., contingent upon relative, specified company and individual performance.     Hire and retain talented executives by having a compensation program that is competitive in relation to comparable companies based on size, overall complexity and the nature of our business.     Ensure company goals are fully aligned throughout the organization. Each year, we establish company-wide goals that align with Frontier's business plan for the year. Our NEOs are compensated to the extent they are successful in leading Frontier to achieve these goals for each year.
