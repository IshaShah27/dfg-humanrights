Dear Fellow Stockholders, 
We would like to thank you for your support of Nasdaq. We approached 2018 with a dual focus: developing our core businesses organically and expanding in promising growth areas that align with our strategic objectives. Our long-term goal is to drive sustainable growth and value creation for you, our stockholders. 
We recognize our role in society and remain committed to achieving our goal by executing efficiently, innovating for our clients, serving our communities, managing risks and pursuing excellence in every business segment to achieve long-term sustainable growth. We vigilantly guide Nasdaq by not only asking the "why" but also by governing the "how"; a successful visionary strategy depends on thoughtful execution. 
As we reflect on 2018 and look forward, we believe Nasdaq is strategically positioned for future growth because of our investments in our technology, markets, alternative data and analytics businesses and our commitment to attracting, retaining and developing a workforce that is aligned with our strategic objectives. 
Business Priorities & Strategic Pivot 
Nasdaq's strategic repositioning, a key management initiative launched in 2017 with the Board's full support, continued to move forward with a number of long-term investments. The company's growth segments continue to maximize our capabilities in technology, alternative data and analytics through the integration of eVestment and the acquisitions of Quandl and Cinnober. Our long-term investments in the Nasdaq Financial Framework and SMARTS surveillance platform for the buy-side demonstrate our innovation and proactive responsiveness to client needs and industry best practices. We also took steps to optimize our portfolio through the successful sale of our Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses, the divestiture of our minority stake in LCH Group Holdings Limited and the recently announced agreement to sell BWise to SAI Global. 
Our 2018 financial results are a testament to the success of this repositioning, with $2,526 million in net revenues and strong organic growth. GAAP diluted EPS was $2.73, compared with $4.30 in 2017, while non-GAAP diluted EPS was $4.84, a 20% increase compared with the prior year.2

We committed to investing in profitable growth, with a goal of 10% or greater ROIC. 
Capital Allocation 
A key area of focus for the Board and management in 2018 was capital deployment. We committed to investing in profitable growth, with a goal of 10% or greater ROIC. We raised our quarterly dividend from $0.38 in the first quarter of 2018 to $0.44 in the following three quarters of the year. We also focused on maintaining our investment grade status, with a program to deleverage to a mid-2X ratio. Finally, our commitment to returning capital to stockholders has resulted in Nasdaq buying back more than $1 billion of our shares since 2015, including $294 million in repurchases in 2018 funded by the proceeds received from the divestiture of our Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses. 
Our Commitment to Market Reform 
Both management and the Board recognize that Nasdaq plays an important role within our society. Nasdaq's blueprint to ensure the U.S. markets remain attractive gained significant momentum during the year. Known as 'Revitalize,' this campaign launched in 2017 and seeks to maintain healthy equity markets to ensure job growth, fuel the economy and create long-term wealth. As a result of our efforts, and with bipartisan support, the campaign has spurred discussions on the proxy process by the SEC, movement in Congress to enhance transparency in the proxy advisory industry and growing support among the business community to streamline the quarterly reporting obligations for small and medium growth-sized companies. More information is available at nasdaq.com/revitalize. 
Our Focus on People Practices (Human Capital Management) & Workplace Culture 
Nasdaq remains committed to its diverse and inclusive culture, which we believe is a core strength of our company, particularly as we focus not only on long-term outcomes, but how they are achieved. In 2018, we were pleased with management's notable successes to attract and retain our talented workforce. We encouraged Nasdaq leadership to keenly focus on engaging our current workforce, empowering it to become actively involved in implementing our strategy and advancing our dynamic corporate culture. We also supported the expansion of Nasdaq's highly-competitive intern program, partnering with many prestigious universities to attract new talent. As our business and the industry evolve, we continue to remain focused on creating a corporate culture that is agile, innovative and able to adapt to meet the needs of our customers. 
Corporate Sustainability 
ESG remains a major focus for Nasdaq, at both the Board and management levels, for our own company and our clients. The Nominating & Governance Committee of our Board expanded its responsibilities in 2019 to include oversight of environmental and social policies, practices, initiatives and reporting. We launched several new ESG products, including our ESG Data Portal and the ESG Pilot Program, aimed at supporting global markets in achieving better ESG reporting. During 2018, Nasdaq reinforced its own commitment to green office space with the Nasdaq MarketSite transitioning to 100% renewable energy sourcing. Nasdaq was also the only stock exchange operator on the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for a third consecutive year.

Enterprise Risk Management 
As a Board, we focus on defensive as well as proactive initiatives, and Nasdaq's cybersecurity and enterprise risk management disciplines are at the core of our work for clients and the markets we serve. We maintain a comprehensive information security program led by our Chief Information Security Officer, who has defined a multi-year cybersecurity strategic plan that incorporates guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology industry standard Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity. In addition, our Global Ethics and Compliance Program supports Nasdaq's mission and business goals by reinforcing our ethical culture and managing compliance risk. 
We continue to evolve and enhance our systems and programs to better deal with unpredictable occurrences in our business. In September 2018, a clearing member of Nasdaq Clearing's commodities market defaulted. Under the oversight of the Audit Committee, Nasdaq Clearing quickly launched a review of Nasdaq Clearing´s risk management practices, conducted by a third-party firm, Oliver Wyman, and developed a plan to enhance the governance and operations of our clearinghouse throughout 2019. Nasdaq Clearing is already implementing many of these enhancements. 
Board and Committee Composition 
In our continued evaluation of our Board composition to ensure the Board is comprised of talented, skilled and ethical directors aligned with the long-term interests of stockholders, we are pleased to nominate Alfred W. Zollar, Executive Partner at Siris Capital Group, LLC and an experienced technologist and FinTech executive, to the Board. We also remain strongly committed to diversity on the Board. 
A continued priority for the Board is to hear from you and engage with you, our stockholders. Please continue to share your views, opinions and suggestions with us by writing us at: AskBoard@nasdaq.com or Nasdaq Board of Directors c/o Joan Conley, SVP and Corporate Secretary, 805 King Farm Blvd., Rockville, MD 20850. We would like to thank you for your trust in Nasdaq. Our Board is committed to driving value on your behalf through our steadfast support of Nasdaq's corporate strategy and our management team's purposeful execution of our strategy in alignment with our mission and values.

Dear Stockholders, 
As I look back on 2018, my second year serving as President and CEO of Nasdaq, I reflect on a year marked by the new strategic direction for our company. I am proud to say that we made substantial progress toward the ambitious and far-reaching objectives that we established at the end of 2017. The steps we took to put our strategy into action reaffirm our commitment to growth by realigning with our clients' needs, establishing Nasdaq as an innovative analytics and technology leader, deploying our "Markets Everywhere" technology efforts and enhancing our competitive position across our foundational businesses. 
Of course, preparing for the future requires being nimble and adaptable to change – and 2018 was undoubtedly a year of significant change and disruption for the global capital markets. These changes stemmed from a variety of technological, market-driven and regulatory issues. However, we were able to react accordingly and stay focused on the long-term goals that we set for ourselves. 
Rewrite Tomorrow 
2018 was a critical year for Nasdaq as we progressed on our path to maximize our opportunities as a technology and analytics provider while we sustained and grew our core marketplace businesses. We delivered net revenues of $2.5 billion and solid full-year organic revenue growth of 8% across our businesses, a substantial increase from recent years. This was driven by our non-trading business segments each contributing at or above their recently-raised medium-term growth outlook ranges, while our core Market Services business delivered its best performance in seven years and our index franchise set new records both in terms of revenues and licensed AUMs. 
We also are successfully reallocating resources to Nasdaq's growth areas, investing over $1 billion into our Market Technology and Information Services businesses through a mix of acquisitions and R&D initiatives to maximize our capabilities in emerging technology, data and analytics. The completion of our acquisitions of data and analytics platforms eVestment and Quandl, as well as Cinnober, an exchange and clearing technology provider, will allow us to stay on the forefront of the technologies that are critical to our clients' success. 
With our capital allocation priorities, we remain committed to returning capital as earnings and free cash flow grow. In 2018, we delivered $674 million back to our stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends, while also raising our quarterly dividend per share by 16%.

 A D E N A    T.    F R I E D M A N   President & CEO, Nasdaq   A central component to our business strategy is a broad understanding that  we are operating in a fast-moving and dynamic environment driven by rapid technological change and shifting client demands. The investments we made in the Nasdaq Financial Framework, our next generation market technology platform, are of  particular importance. The Nasdaq Financial Framework infrastructure can be delivered for the first time as a hosted solution, unlocking new growth opportunities and enabling material operating efficiencies.   While this investment initiative is long-term in nature, the client response  has been encouraging, and we were incredibly excited to announce our partnership with NSE, the largest exchange in India and one of the largest exchanges in the world by volume. NSE agreed to replace its clearing and settlement systems with  architecture using the Nasdaq Financial Framework to allow clearing and settlement of all asset classes in one system. In April, Gemini, the digital asset exchange and custodian, announced it will leverage our SMARTS market surveillance  technology to monitor its marketplace and surveil activity across the Gemini auction process that is used to determine the settlement price for certain Bitcoin futures. In total, our Market Technology segment signed 12 new market  infrastructure operator clients and 20 new buy- and sell-side clients for our surveillance solutions in 2018, nearly double the number of clients signed in 2017.   We have also started to evolve how the Nasdaq Financial Framework can  benefit enterprises outside of traditional financial markets, such as those in the advertising, insurance and gaming and wagering industries. While this "markets everywhere" opportunity is still in the early stages, we are seeing  encouraging progress with notable partnerships in Hong Kong and Stockholm and look forward to sharing exciting updates later in the year.   Finally, we optimized our portfolio through the successful sale of our Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses to West  Corporation in mid-2018 and the recently announced agreement to sell BWise to SAI Global. These divestitures allow us to shift resources, people and capital to growth opportunity areas within  the company, while also maintaining investments in core businesses.

While this "markets everywhere" opportunity is still in the early stages, we are seeing  encouraging progress with notable partnerships in Hong Kong and Stockholm and look forward to sharing exciting updates later in the year.   Finally, we optimized our portfolio through the successful sale of our Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses to West  Corporation in mid-2018 and the recently announced agreement to sell BWise to SAI Global. These divestitures allow us to shift resources, people and capital to growth opportunity areas within  the company, while also maintaining investments in core businesses.           
 A D E N A    T.    F R I E D M A N   President & CEO, Nasdaq   A central component to our business strategy is a broad understanding that  we are operating in a fast-moving and dynamic environment driven by rapid technological change and shifting client demands. The investments we made in the Nasdaq Financial Framework, our next generation market technology platform, are of  particular importance. The Nasdaq Financial Framework infrastructure can be delivered for the first time as a hosted solution, unlocking new growth opportunities and enabling material operating efficiencies.   While this investment initiative is long-term in nature, the client response  has been encouraging, and we were incredibly excited to announce our partnership with NSE, the largest exchange in India and one of the largest exchanges in the world by volume. NSE agreed to replace its clearing and settlement systems with  architecture using the Nasdaq Financial Framework to allow clearing and settlement of all asset classes in one system. In April, Gemini, the digital asset exchange and custodian, announced it will leverage our SMARTS market surveillance  technology to monitor its marketplace and surveil activity across the Gemini auction process that is used to determine the settlement price for certain Bitcoin futures.

In our sixth consecutive year as the market leader in the number of IPOs in the U.S., we led U.S. exchanges with a 72% win-rate, welcoming 186 IPOs, with new listings raising $27.7 billion. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   72% U.S. IPO win-rate   186 U.S. IPOs listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2018            The Quality of the U.S. and European Capital  Markets   2018 also was a notable year for new listings at Nasdaq  – our sixth consecutive year as market leader in the number of IPOs in the U.S. We led U.S. exchanges with a 72% win-rate, welcoming 186 IPOs, with new listings raising $27.7 billion. However,  despite favorable market conditions for the majority of the year, there are still fewer publicly listed companies today than there were 25 years ago. We remain committed to working toward many of the market overhaul objectives we laid out in  our blueprint, "The Promise of Market Reform: Reigniting America's Economic Engine," and there have been numerous developments worthy of celebration.   In July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed JOBS Act 3.0 by a 406-4 bipartisan vote that advances many aspects of our blueprint's agenda. We saw the SEC affirm how important transparency is to well-functioning markets, and we were proud to share some of our  'Revitalize' agenda through participation in the agency's roundtable on thinly-traded securities. Separately, we continue to be vocal in support of improving the market structure for thinly-traded exchange traded  products.   We remain committed to advocating for reforms that  improve market structure and aim to ease regulatory challenges our corporate clients are facing. In April 2018, we participated in an SEC roundtable to discuss market structure for small and mid-cap  securities, following which we submitted an application for a rule change that would ease the pressures of fragmented trading, and we continue to be engaged with policy makers and regulators on various issues pertinent to our clients.  This includes obtaining signatures from more than 300 listed companies to propose SEC oversight of proxy advisors and supporting the SEC's proposal to extend  "test-the-waters" reform by allowing all issuers to communicate with potential investors about a possible IPO or other registered securities  offerings.

In April 2018, we participated in an SEC roundtable to discuss market structure for small and mid-cap  securities, following which we submitted an application for a rule change that would ease the pressures of fragmented trading, and we continue to be engaged with policy makers and regulators on various issues pertinent to our clients.  This includes obtaining signatures from more than 300 listed companies to propose SEC oversight of proxy advisors and supporting the SEC's proposal to extend  "test-the-waters" reform by allowing all issuers to communicate with potential investors about a possible IPO or other registered securities  offerings.

In Europe, where our Nordic markets continue to attract new companies from across the region, we are working together with relevant stakeholders and industry organizations to ensure the implementation of the MiFID II legislation will not hinder the function, growth and development of European markets. While we support MiFID II's goal of increasing investor protection, fairness and transparency, we continue to work with key policy makers to enhance the new rules to ensure that they accomplish their intended purpose. Additionally, as a result of new MiFID II requirements, we are working with our corporate clients to help them manage significant changes that are impacting research coverage and corporate access to both the buy-side and sell-side. 
Environmental, Social and Governance 
In addition to making strides this year toward the future of our business, we remain committed to ensuring the sustainability of our planet and the strength of the communities where we live and work. In 2018, ESG remained high on the radar of both our clients and Nasdaq – starting with a commitment from our Board and senior management, and extending throughout the entire organization and our operations. 
Nasdaq was able to reach new milestones for its ESG offerings last year, which we view as critical to ensuring that we are both a leader of and a participant in an industry-wide effort to enhance voluntary ESG reporting guidelines. We launched new ESG-focused client solutions to achieve this goal, including our ESG Data Portal, a centralized distribution point that offers investors access to standardized ESG data from companies listed on our Nordic markets. We also continue to see strong client-adoption of our ESG Reporting Guide Pilot in the Nordic and Baltic regions. 
We reinforced our commitment to green office space during the year by successfully transitioning the Nasdaq MarketSite to 100% renewable energy sourcing. Nasdaq was also the only stock exchange operator on the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for a third consecutive year – a testament to our success in integrating sustainable practices into our business. 
To be the best organization possible, we have remained committed to one of our most important strengths: our diverse and inclusive corporate culture. We made further progress toward our goals last year through a refreshed values framework and programs that foster inclusion and celebrate the differences among all of our employees. These important measures help ensure that Nasdaq's ethics and transparency standards are first-rate, allowing us to attract and retain the talented people we need to accomplish our strategic goals.

2019 Director Nominee 
We continually look to ensure our leadership – including our Board of Directors – is comprised of fresh insights and new perspectives that represent the long-term interest of our stockholders, and we strive for diversity to advance our commitment to foster an inclusive and forward-thinking workplace. We were fortunate to welcome Jacob Wallenberg, Chairman of Investor AB, as our newest director in April 2018. We are pleased to have Alfred W. Zollar, Executive Partner of Siris Capital Group, LLC and former executive at IBM, stand for election to the Board at our Annual Meeting. 
Looking Ahead 
Nasdaq's accomplishments in 2018, along with our commitment to maintaining our course for the future, provide me with immense pride and excitement for what's to come. I am confident that we are taking the right actions now to succeed in a future of limitless innovation and growth opportunities – a future that isn't far away. 
During the next year, our efforts will focus on the following execution priorities. First, we aim to enhance our technology presence across capital markets and beyond, which we intend to measure principally through the implementation and client adoption of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. Second, we aim to drive better client interactions through our trade surveillance, data analytics and integrity solutions across our sell-side, buy-side and corporate clients, which we will measure through the client adoption of our innovative solutions. Third, we want to enhance our leadership position in the marketplaces in which we operate as we continue to innovate with new functionality and strong market share in our core marketplaces. And lastly, we want to build meaningfully on our high integrity, mission-driven culture, to multiply our opportunities to innovate and grow. 
The years ahead for Nasdaq are bright, and our team is energized by the early results of our strategic direction to reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow.

Engaging with Our Stockholders 
We value our stockholders' perspectives and maintain a robust stockholder engagement program. During 2018, we conducted outreach to a cross-section of stockholders owning approximately 45% of our outstanding shares. In 2018, our key stockholder engagement activities included our 2018 Investor Day, 6 investor (non-deal) road shows in 6 countries, 17 investor conferences and our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
We also held formal engagement sessions with the investment stewardship teams at holders of approximately 60% of our outstanding shares. In addition, we conducted quarterly outreach to the investment stewardship teams at many of our institutional holders. 
Ongoing communication with our stockholders helps the Board and senior management gain useful feedback on a wide range of subjects and understand the issues that matter most to our stockholders. Nasdaq views accountability to stockholders as both a mark of good governance and a critical component of our success. Management regularly confers with investors and actively solicits feedback on a variety of topics including those listed below.

   We use long-term incentives to promote retention and reward our NEOs.         Our  main long-term incentive program for NEOs consists entirely of PSUs based on TSR relative to other companies, including the S&P 500 companies and a group of peer companies. Over the three-year period from January 1, 2016 through  December 31, 2018, Nasdaq's cumulative TSR was 54.9%, which was at the 76th percentile of S&P 500 companies and the 43rd percentile of peer companies. This TSR performance resulted in performance vesting of PSUs at  130% of target shares.

Corporate Governance Framework 
Our governance framework focuses on the interests of stockholders. It is designed to promote governance transparency and ensure our Board has the necessary authority to review and evaluate our business operations and make decisions that are independent of management and in the best interests of stockholders. Our goal is to align the interests of directors, management and stockholders while complying with or exceeding the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market and applicable law. 
This governance framework establishes the practices our Board follows with respect to oversight of:

Board's Role in Long-Term Strategic Planning 
The Board takes an active role with management to formulate and review Nasdaq's long-term corporate strategy and capital allocation plan for long-term value creation. In 2017, with the full participation and support of the Board, Nasdaq undertook a comprehensive review of its existing strategic framework. As a result of the review, we reoriented our vision, mission and strategy to embrace our strengths and focus on businesses that respond to our clients' and customers' evolving needs. 
In 2018, the Board continued to focus on our reoriented strategy with emphasis on client segment viewpoints and opportunities, our culture of innovation, specific business unit strategies, M&A and financial considerations. For further information on our corporate strategy, see "Item 1. Business–Growth Strategy" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

The Nominating & Governance Committee oversees and plans for director succession and refreshment of the Board to ensure a mix of skills, experience, tenure and diversity that promotes and supports the company's long-term strategy. 
The Board and management routinely confer on our company's execution of its long-term strategic plans, the status of key strategic initiatives and the principal strategic opportunities and risks facing Nasdaq. In addition, the Board periodically devotes meetings to conduct an in-depth long-term strategic review with our company's senior management team. During these reviews, the Board and management discuss emerging technological and macroeconomic trends and short and long-term plans and priorities for each of our business units. 
Additionally, the Board annually discusses and approves the company's budget and capital allocation plan, which are linked to Nasdaq's long-term strategic plans and priorities. Through these processes, the Board brings its collective, independent judgment to bear on the most critical long-term strategic issues facing Nasdaq. 
Board Refreshment 
The Nominating & Governance Committee oversees and plans for director succession and refreshment of the Board to ensure a mix of skills, experience, tenure and diversity that promotes and supports the company's long-term strategy. In doing so, the Nominating & Governance Committee takes into consideration the corporate strategy and the overall needs, composition and size of the Board, as well as the criteria adopted by the Board regarding director qualifications. 
In addition, the Board has nominated Alfred W. Zollar, who is an Executive Partner at Siris Capital Group, LLC and a former executive at IBM, for election to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Mr. Zollar is an experienced technologist and FinTech executive and has significant experience as a director of publicly traded companies. 
Succession Planning for Nasdaq Leadership 
The Board is committed to positioning Nasdaq for further growth through ongoing talent management, succession planning and the deepening of our leadership bench. In this regard, formally on an annual basis and informally throughout the year in Executive Session, the Nominating & Governance Committee, the Management Compensation Committee, the Board and the President and CEO review the succession planning and leadership development program, including a short-term and long-term succession plan for development, retention and replacement of senior officers. These reviews and succession planning discussions take into account desired leadership skills, key capabilities and experience in light of our current and evolving business and strategic direction. Our directors also have exposure to key talent through Board and Committee presentations and discussions, as well as informal events and interactions throughout the year. 
In conjunction with the annual report of the succession plan, the President and CEO also reports on Nasdaq's program for senior management leadership development. 
In addition, the President and CEO prepares, and the Board reviews, a short-term succession plan that delineates a temporary delegation of authority to certain officers of the company, if all or a portion of the senior officers should unexpectedly become unable to perform their duties.

In 2018, the full Board reviewed specific executive development and talent management topics at two of its scheduled in-person meetings. 
Risk Oversight 
The Board's role in risk oversight is consistent with the company's leadership structure, with management having day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing the company's risk exposure and the Board having ultimate responsibility for overseeing risk management with a focus on the most significant risks facing the company. The Board is assisted in meeting this responsibility by several Board Committees as described below under "Board Committees." The Audit Committee receives regular reports relating to operational compliance with the company's risk appetite and reviews any deviations, ultimately reporting on them to the Board. Furthermore, directors meet on a regular basis, both in Chairman's Session with the CEO present and in Executive Session without the presence of management, to discuss a wide range of matters, including matters pertaining to risk. 
The Board, through the Audit Committee, sets the company's risk appetite (i.e., the boundaries within which Nasdaq's management operates while achieving corporate objectives). In addition, Nasdaq's Board reviews and approves the company's ERM Policy, which mandates ERM requirements and defines employees' risk management roles and responsibilities. 
Per the ERM Policy, Nasdaq employs an ERM approach that manages risk within the approved risk appetite through objective and consistent identification, assessment, monitoring and measurement of significant risks across the company. 
Nasdaq classifies risks into the following four broad categories. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  Strategic and Business Risk: Risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the business environment  and from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business environment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  Financial Risk: Risk to the company's financial position or ability to operate due to investment  decisions and financial risk management practices in particular as it relates to market, credit, capital and liquidity risks.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  Operational Risk: Risks arising from the company's people, processes and systems and external causes,  including, among other things, risks related to transaction errors, financial misstatements, technology, information security (including cybersecurity), engagement of third parties and maintaining business continuity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  Legal and Regulatory Risk: Exposure to civil and criminal consequences - including regulatory penalties,  fines, forfeiture and litigation - while conducting business operations.  
[END TABLE]
Nasdaq's management has day-to-day responsibility for: (i) managing risk arising from company activities, including making decisions within stated Board-delegated authority; (ii) ensuring employees understand their responsibilities for managing risk incorporating a "three lines of defense" model; and (iii) establishing internal controls as well as guidance and standards

to implement the risk management policy. In the "three lines of defense" model, the first line (i.e., the business and corporate support units) executes core processes and controls, the second line (i.e., the risk, control, and oversight teams) sets policies and establishes frameworks to manage risks and the third line (i.e., the Internal Audit Department) provides an independent review of the first and second lines. 
Nasdaq's Global Risk Management Committee, which comprises senior executives, assists the Board in its risk oversight role, ensuring that the ERM framework is appropriate and functioning as intended and the level of risk assumed by the company is consistent with Nasdaq's strategy and risk appetite. Nasdaq also has other limited-scope management risk committees that address specific risks, geographic areas and/or subsidiaries. These risk management committees, which include representatives from business units and support functions, monitor current and emerging risks within their purview to ensure an appropriate level of risk. Together, the various management risk committees facilitate timely escalation of issues to the Global Risk Management Committee, which escalates critical issues to the Board. 
Nasdaq's Group Risk Management Department oversees the ERM framework, supports its implementation and aggregates and reports risk information. 
Board Leadership Structure 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Nasdaq separates the roles of Chairman of the Board and President and CEO. Our Chairman of the Board is an independent director. We believe that this separation of roles and allocation of distinct responsibilities to each role facilitates communication between senior management and the full Board about issues such as corporate governance, management development, succession planning, executive compensation and company performance. 
Nasdaq's President and CEO, Adena T. Friedman, who has over 20 years' experience in the securities industry, is responsible for the strategic direction, day-to-day leadership and performance of Nasdaq. The Chairman of Nasdaq's Board, Michael R. Splinter, who brings to the Board leadership experience as a public company CEO, as well as cybersecurity, capital markets and FinTech expertise, provides guidance to the President and CEO, presides over Board meetings, including Executive Sessions, and serves as a primary liaison between the President and CEO and other directors. 
Board Diversity 
If each director nominee is elected to the Board at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 64% of the Board will be diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity or nationality.

Stockholder Communication with Directors  
Stockholders and other interested parties are invited to contact the Board by writing us at: AskBoard@nasdaq.com or Nasdaq Board of Directors, c/o Joan C. Conley, SVP and Corporate Secretary, 805 King Farm Boulevard, Rockville, Maryland 20850. 
Code of Ethics: Board and Employees 
We embrace good governance by holding ourselves to the highest ethical standards in all our interactions. We have adopted the Nasdaq Code of Ethics, which is applicable to the Board, all of our employees (including the principal executive officer, the principal financial officer and the controller and principal accounting officer), contractors and others who conduct work on behalf of Nasdaq. We also have a separate Nasdaq Code of Conduct for the Board, which contains supplemental provisions specifically applicable to directors. These codes embody the company's fundamental ethics and compliance principles and expectations of business conduct. 
The Nasdaq Code of Ethics and related policies are subject to annual review by our Board. As part of the 2018 updates to the Code of Ethics and related policies, we enhanced coverage of our commitment to preventing fraud or money laundering related to our business, prohibiting insider trading (in particular, related to cybersecurity events) and addressing personal data breaches. We also added content to the Code of Ethics to help employees with ethical decision-making in determining whether to give or receive a gift or business courtesy. Other revisions reflected updates to company policies, regulatory developments and other improvements identified as part of the annual review process. 
Our Global Ethics and Compliance Program is based on industry-leading practices and is designed to meet or exceed available standards, including those promulgated by U.S. and European regulators in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Pillars of the program include structural elements, such as policies, risk assessment, monitoring, training and communications, and key risk areas, including anti-bribery and corruption, data privacy and antitrust and competition. The Global Ethics and Compliance Program is reinforced by executive leadership including coverage of ethics during employee town halls and participation in our ongoing Ethics in Action webinar series. 
Nasdaq is committed to providing employees the ability to report concerns or seek guidance on ethics and compliance matters without fear of retaliation. In 2018, we reinforced our SpeakUp! Program with communications and training to ensure Nasdaq employees and other stakeholders have awareness of channels to raise issues, seek guidance and report potential violations of our Code of Ethics or other company policies. The program is administered within the Legal and Regulatory Group and implemented by cross-functional teams representing all areas of the company. Oversight is provided by the Global Compliance Council.

The ESG Working Group serves as the central oversight body for our environmental and social strategy. In 2018, the ESG Working Group formalized its mission statement, identified short- and long-term goals aligned with institutional investor and employee input, established a formal governance framework and deployed an employee awareness program and call to action.

Board of Directors 
Proposal 1: Election of Directors 
The business and affairs of Nasdaq are managed under the direction of our Board. Our directors have diverse backgrounds and experience and represent a broad spectrum of viewpoints. 
Pursuant to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws and based on our governance needs, the Board may determine the total number of directors. The Board is authorized to have 11 directors following our 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Each of the 11 nominees identified in this proxy statement has been nominated by our Nominating & Governance Committee and Board for election to a one-year term expiring at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Each director will hold office until his or her successor has been elected and qualified or until the director's earlier death, resignation or removal. All nominees have consented to be named in this proxy statement and to serve on the Nasdaq Board, if elected. 
In an uncontested election, our directors are elected by a majority of votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present. This election is an uncontested election and therefore, each of the 11 nominees must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast to be duly elected to the Board. Any shares not voted, including as a result of abstentions or broker non-votes, will not impact the vote. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that, in an uncontested election, an incumbent director must submit an irrevocable resignation as a condition to his or her nomination for election. If an incumbent director fails to receive the requisite number of votes in an uncontested election, the irrevocable resignation becomes effective and such resignation will be considered by the Nominating & Governance Committee. This Committee will recommend to the full Board whether or not to accept the resignation. The Board is required to act on the recommendation and to disclose publicly its decision-making process with respect to the resignation. All the incumbent directors have submitted an irrevocable resignation. 
Director Nomination Process                 
The Nominating & Governance Committee maintains an active list of potential board nominees that they continuously review as they consider how our business evolves and expands over time. The Nominating & Governance Committee considers possible candidates suggested by Board and Committee members, stockholders, industry groups and senior management. In addition to submitting suggested nominees to the Nominating & Governance Committee, a Nasdaq stockholder may nominate a person for election as a director, provided the stockholder follows the procedures specified in Nasdaq's By-Laws. The Nominating & Governance Committee reviews all candidates in the same manner, regardless of the source of the recommendation. In addition, the Nominating & Governance Committee may engage a third-party search firm from time-to-time to

 assist in identifying and evaluating qualified candidates. For 2019, the new nominee to our Board was brought to the attention of the Nominating & Governance Committee by both our President and CEO and one of our current directors. 
We are obligated by the terms of a stockholders' agreement dated February 27, 2008 between Nasdaq and Borse Dubai, as amended, to nominate and generally use best efforts to cause the election to the Nasdaq Board of one individual designated by Borse Dubai, subject to certain conditions. H.E. Kazim is the individual designated by Borse Dubai as its nominee. 
We are also obligated by the terms of a stockholders' agreement dated December 16, 2010 between Nasdaq and Investor AB to nominate and generally use best efforts to cause the election to the Nasdaq Board of one individual designated by Investor AB, subject to certain conditions. Mr. Wallenberg is the individual designated by Investor AB as its nominee. 
Director Independence                 
Nasdaq's common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market and Nasdaq Dubai. In order to qualify as independent under the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, a director must satisfy a two-part test. First, the director must not fall into any of several categories that would automatically disqualify the director from being deemed independent. Second, no director qualifies as independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no direct or indirect relationship with the company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. 
Under the Nasdaq Dubai listing rules and the Markets Rules of the Dubai Financial Services Authority, a director is considered independent if the Board determines the director to be independent in character and judgment and to have no commercial or other relationships or circumstances that are likely to affect, or could appear to impair, the director's judgment in a manner other than in the best interests of the company. 
Based upon detailed written submissions by each director nominee, the Board has determined that all of our director nominees are independent under the rules of each of The Nasdaq Stock Market and Nasdaq Dubai, other than Ms. Friedman. Ms. Friedman is deemed not to be independent because she is Nasdaq's President and CEO. 
None of the director nominees are party to any arrangement with any person or entity other than the company relating to compensation or other payments in connection with the director's or nominee's candidacy or service as a director, other than arrangements that existed prior to the director's or nominee's candidacy.

Director Criteria, Qualifications, Experience and Tenure 
In evaluating the suitability of individual Board nominees, the Nominating & Governance Committee takes into account many factors that are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These factors include a general and diverse understanding of the global economy, capital markets, finance and other disciplines relevant to the success of a large publicly-traded financial technology company, including cybersecurity; a general understanding of Nasdaq's business and technology; the classification requirements under our By-Laws; the individual's educational and professional background and personal accomplishments; diversity, including factors such as gender, age and geography; and the willingness to challenge the status quo. 
The Nominating & Governance Committee evaluates each individual candidate in the context of the Board as a whole, with the objective of maintaining a group of directors that can further the success of Nasdaq's businesses, while representing the interests of stockholders, employees and the communities in which the company operates. In determining whether to recommend a Board member for re-election, the Nominating & Governance Committee also considers the director's participation in and contributions to the activities of the Board, the contents of the most recent Board and director assessment and attendance at meetings. 
The Board and the Nominating & Governance Committee believe all director nominees exhibit the characteristics below.

In addition, there are other attributes, skills and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole, but not necessarily by each director. The table below summarizes key qualifications, skills and attributes most relevant to serve on the Board. A mark indicates a specific area of focus or expertise on which the Board relies most; however, the lack of a mark does not mean the director does not possess that qualification or skill.

2   The differences in fees earned or paid in cash reported in this column largely reflect differences  in each individual director's election to receive the annual retainer and Committee service fees in cash or RSUs. These elections are made at the beginning of the Board compensation year and apply throughout the year. In addition, the  difference in fees earned or paid also reflects individual Committee service.

4   These stock awards, which were awarded on April 24, 2018 to all the non-employee directors elected to the Board on that date, represent the annual equity award and any portion of annual retainer or Committee service fees that the director elected to receive in equity. Each non-employee director received the annual equity award, which consisted of 2,666 RSUs with a grant date fair value of $225,490. Mr. Splinter elected to receive his Chairman retainer in equity so he received an  additional 2,782 RSUs with a grant date fair value of $235,302. Directors Black, Kazim, Kloet and Wallenberg elected to receive all of their annual retainers in equity, so they each received an additional 869 RSUs with a grant date fair value of  $73,500. Director Arnoldi elected to receive half of the annual retainer in equity, so she received an additional 434 RSUs with a grant date fair value of $36,708. In addition, individual directors received the following amounts for Committee  service fees: Mr. Black (405 RSUs with a grant date fair value of $34,255); H.E.

PROPOSAL 2: 
Approval of the Company's Executive Compensation on an Advisory Basis 
We are asking stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the company's executive compensation as reported in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the executive compensation program and practices described in this proxy statement. 
We urge stockholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis below as well as the executive compensation tables and narrative beginning on page 67. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our executive compensation program and the decisions made by our Management Compensation Committee in 2018 in more detail. The compensation tables provide detailed information on the compensation of our NEOs. The Board and the Management Compensation Committee believe that the compensation program for our NEOs has been effective in meeting the core principles described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this proxy statement and has contributed to the company's long-term success. 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and as a matter of good corporate governance, we are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Nasdaq, Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Nasdaq's NEOs, as disclosed in the proxy statement for Nasdaq's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables and other related tables and narrative disclosure. 
This advisory vote is not binding on the Board and the Management Compensation Committee. Although non-binding, the Board and the Management Compensation Committee will review and consider the outcome of the vote when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program. 
The Board has adopted a policy providing for annual stockholder advisory votes to approve the company's executive compensation. Under the current version of the policy, the next advisory vote to approve executive compensation will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Say on Pay Results 
Each year we carefully consider the results of our Say on Pay advisory vote from the prior year. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, over 96.4% of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. In 2018 we retained the core elements of our executive compensation program, policies and decisions. We believe our programs continue to appropriately motivate and reward our senior management. 
In addition to the perspective provided by the Say on Pay results, we also carefully solicit and consider feedback from our stockholders on executive compensation, corporate governance and other issues throughout the year. For further information on our stockholder engagement, see "Engaging with Our Stockholders" on page 18. 
Compensation Determinations 
We have established a process for evaluating the performance of the company, the President and CEO and other NEOs for compensation purposes. On an annual basis, the Management Compensation Committee, the Board and Nominating & Governance Committee review our President and CEO's performance in Executive Session. As part of their deliberative process, the Management Compensation Committee and Board evaluate our President and CEO's performance against the pre-established corporate goals and determine appropriate compensation. The factors considered include our President and CEO's performance against annual performance objectives, the performance of the company, the quality and development of the management team and employee engagement. 
With the support of the People@Nasdaq group, our President and CEO develops compensation recommendations for the executive officers for consideration by the Management Compensation Committee and/or the Board. As part of this process, our President and CEO meets individually with each executive to discuss his or her performance against pre-established objectives determined during the previous year, as well as performance objectives and development plans for the coming year. This meeting gives each executive an opportunity to present his or her perspective of his or her performance as well as potential objectives and challenges for the upcoming year. Our President and CEO presents the results of each of the executive meetings to the Management Compensation Committee for its review and consideration as part of its deliberation process. 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
96.4% 
of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation.

Competitive Positioning 
To evaluate the external competitiveness of our executive compensation program, we compare certain elements of the program to similar elements used by peer companies. In setting 2018 compensation levels, the Management Compensation Committee used a comprehensive peer group, consisting of 31 companies, to conduct a competitive market analysis of the compensation program for our NEOs. We believe using and disclosing a peer group supports good governance and provides valuable input into compensation levels and program design. 
When forming the peer group, we considered potential peers among both direct industry competitors and companies in related industries with similar talent needs. After identifying potential peers on this basis, we used the following seven screening criteria to select appropriate peer companies. 
Each of these factors was considered, based on varying importance, to create a more refined list of companies for consideration. We then further reviewed each remaining company to determine its appropriateness for the final peer group with a particular focus on identifying meaningful talent peers. Certain companies were eliminated because of factors such as significantly different financials, limited competitive position for executive talent or limited global complexity relative to Nasdaq. 
Based on the foregoing criteria, in connection with our strategic pivot, we expanded our executive compensation peer group to include an additional four companies in the market data and analytics industry to better reflect the extent to which Nasdaq competes for talent in this area. We also added eight companies in the technology industry to reflect Nasdaq's strategic focus on disruptive technologies such as machine intelligence and cloud-based computing. 
We believe the current peer group includes an accurate representation of Nasdaq's size-relevant, talent-focused comparators and industry competitors.

Each executive is evaluated individually based on skills, knowledge, performance, growth potential and, in the Management Compensation Committee's business judgment, the value he or she brings to the organization and Nasdaq's retention risk. 
In addition to the peer group, we also consider that Nasdaq faces competition for talent from private firms, such as high frequency and other small trading firms, private equity funds and non-public technology companies for which public compensation data is not available. 
Peer group data serves as only one reference point in evaluating our executive compensation program. We use this data to understand how various elements of our executive compensation program compare to other companies. However, we do not set the compensation of our executives based solely on this data nor do we target executive compensation to a specific percentile of the compensation set by our peer group. Instead, the comparison is conducted solely to determine if the compensation we pay to NEOs is competitive to the market. Each executive is evaluated individually based on skills, knowledge, performance, growth potential and, in the Management Compensation Committee's business judgment, the value he or she brings to the organization and Nasdaq's retention risk. 
President and CEO's Role in the Executive Compensation Process 
Our President and CEO regularly attends Management Compensation Committee meetings at the invitation of the Management Compensation Committee and provides her perspective to the Management Compensation Committee regarding executive compensation matters generally and the specific performance of the other executive officers. 
However, in accordance with the listing rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the President and CEO does not vote on executive compensation matters or attend Executive Sessions of the Management Compensation Committee or Board, and the President and CEO is not present when her own compensation is being discussed or approved. 
Role of Compensation Consultants 
In 2018, our People@Nasdaq group engaged Meridian Compensation Partners to assist staff in gathering data, reviewing best practices and making recommendations to the Management Compensation Committee about our executive compensation program. Meridian does not provide any other services to Nasdaq other than executive compensation consulting. Meridian does not directly advise the Management Compensation Committee or attend meetings. In 2018, we paid Meridian $38,212 in fees for competitive market data for executives and outside directors and $183,052 in fees for other executive compensation services. However, Meridian does not determine or recommend the amount or form of executive or director compensation. 
Tally Sheets 
When recommending compensation for the President and CEO and other NEOs, the Management Compensation Committee reviews tally sheets that detail the various elements of compensation for each executive. These tally sheets are used to evaluate the appropriateness of the total compensation package, to compare each executive's total compensation opportunity with his or her actual payout and to ensure that the compensation appropriately reflects the compensation program's focus on pay for performance.

Pay for Performance 
Nasdaq's executive compensation program is designed to deliver pay in accordance with corporate and business unit financial and strategic objectives as well as individual performance, levels of responsibility, breadth of knowledge and experience. A large percentage of total target compensation is "at-risk" through long-term equity awards and annual cash incentive awards. These awards are linked to actual performance and include a substantial portion of equity. The mix of total target direct compensation for our NEOs in 2018 is shown below.

Base Salary 
Base salaries are a fixed component of each NEO's compensation. In setting each NEO's base salary, the Management Compensation Committee and/or Board considers competitive market data derived from our peer group, annual market surveys and the NEO's individual contributions, performance, time in role, scope of responsibility, leadership skills and experience. We review base salaries on an annual basis and may adjust base salaries during the year in response to significant changes in an executive's responsibilities or events that would impact the long-term retention of a key executive. Salaries are established at levels commensurate with each executive's title, position and experience, recognizing that each executive is managing a component of a complex global company. 
The following table shows each NEO's base salary at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

For 2018, the Management Compensation Committee and Board increased Ms. Friedman's target annual incentive compensation based on performance-related factors and a review of the competitive positioning of her overall compensation as compared to the compensation of similar officers at companies in our peer group. The Management Compensation Committee increased the target annual incentive compensation of Messrs. Knight and Ptasznik for the same reasons. 
Performance Goals 
The annual cash incentive award payments for our executives are based on the achievement of pre-established, quantifiable performance goals. The President and CEO selects and recommends goals for the other executive officers based on their areas of responsibility and input from each executive. The Management Compensation Committee and/or the Board review and consider our President and CEO's recommendations and approve the goals for the coming year after identifying the objectives most critical to our future growth and most likely to hold executives accountable for the operations for which they are responsible. Based on these same factors, the Management Compensation Committee and Board determine and approve the performance goals for the President and CEO.

Operating income (run rate) and net revenues are the company's primary measures of short-term business success and key drivers of long-term stockholder value. Targets for operating income (run rate) and net revenues were set at the beginning of 2018, as part of the company's annual budgeting process, and were subject to adjustment for transactions and other extraordinary events. 
Business unit financial objectives were established at the beginning of the year and were subject to adjustment for transactions and other extraordinary events. The Management Compensation Committee and/or the Board set the business unit objectives to promote and reward revenue and operating income growth. 
Strategic objectives were established at the beginning of the year to ensure focus on longer-term initiatives aligned with executing on our strategic priorities. For our President and CEO, the Management Compensation Committee and Board approved performance goals that related to corporate-wide strategic objectives. The other NEOs had performance goals that were specific to their business units and reflective of the key responsibilities of each executive. 
We set goals at levels where the maximum payout would be difficult to achieve and that are in excess of budget assumptions. The following table shows each NEO's performance objectives for 2018 and the relative weighting of these objectives. 
The annual cash incentive award payments for our executives are based on the achievement of pre-established, quantifiable performance goals.

Potential Payouts 
Payouts are determined after the end of the year and are based on the sum of (i) actual performance under each corporate objective and (ii) actual performance against an executive's business unit financial objectives or strategic objectives. Each goal that applied to the NEOs for 2018 had a minimum, target and maximum performance level. 
Scoring of each goal is based on actual goal achievement compared to the target. In 2018, payouts on each goal could vary between 0% and 200% of the target. 
Payouts under the incentive compensation program also take into account ethical and responsible conduct. All awards are subject to negative adjustment at the full discretion of the Management Compensation Committee and/or the Board.

Non-GAAP operating income  differs from U.S. GAAP operating income due to the exclusion of the following items: amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, merger and strategic initiatives expense and certain other expenses that are not part of ongoing business  expenses.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
In 2018, we granted PSUs to each NEO to incent and reward our NEOs for growth in our TSR relative to two peer groups, as described below. Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, this program represents 100% of the NEOs' long-term stock-based compensation. 
In 2018, each NEO received a grant of PSUs subject to a three-year cumulative performance period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020. The number of PSUs earned is based on Nasdaq's TSR relative to the TSR of the two equally weighted peer groups. The shares earned, if any, vest at the end of the performance period. 
One group consists of all S&P 500 companies and the other group consists of the peer companies on the left. The peer companies include other global exchanges with sizable market capitalizations. 
The TSR results are measured at the beginning and end of the three-year performance period. Nasdaq's relative performance ranking against each of these peer groups will determine the number of vested PSUs. For each vested PSU, Nasdaq will distribute one share of common stock to each NEO. The maximum payout will be 200% of the target number of PSUs granted if Nasdaq ranks at the 85th percentile or above of each of the groups. However, if Nasdaq's TSR is negative for the three-year performance period, regardless of TSR ranking, the payout cannot exceed 100% of the target number of PSUs granted.

The table below illustrates the percentage of the target number of PSUs granted to each NEO that the NEO may receive based upon different levels of achievement against each of the peer groups. For each group, the resulting shares earned will be calculated by multiplying the relevant percentage from the table below by one-half of the target award amount. Any payouts earned at performance levels below the 50th percentile rank are designed to serve as a retention vehicle since we do not regularly grant non-performance-based equity, such as restricted stock, to our NEOs.

Award Determination 
In setting Ms. Friedman's 2018 equity award target, the Management Compensation Committee focused on motivating performance with significant upside and downside based on relative performance. Historical awards, newness to the role and the retention value of Ms. Friedman's outstanding equity were considered when determining the target amount of her award. Peer group data also was considered in establishing a market-competitive award level. 
Ms. Friedman recommended the specific equity award targets for each of the other NEOs, which varied among executives depending upon responsibilities and retention considerations. The Management Compensation Committee and Board evaluated these recommendations and determined that the amount of each award reflected the individual's contributions, was aligned with competitive market levels and was appropriate for retention purposes. 
The target amount and target face value of the PSUs awarded to each of the NEOs under this program is set forth in the table on page 84. The 2018 awards were approved on March 26 and 27, 2018 and granted on March 29, 2018, which was the date of Nasdaq's annual employee equity grant. The equity award targets are established for our NEOs based on an assessment of each officer's position and responsibilities, the competitive market analysis and the company's retention objectives.

To recognize Ms. Friedman's promotion to President and CEO effective January 1, 2017, and to provide strong motivation to deliver long-term stock price appreciation in alignment with stockholder interests, the Management Compensation Committee and Board of Directors granted her a onetime, performance-based stock option award. 100% of the option grant is performance-based, and the grant vests one-third per year over three years, contingent upon the achievement of performance metrics. 
The performance criteria for the option grant are set forth in the table below.

On January 29, 2019, the Management Compensation Committee and Board evaluated and approved the performance results for the vesting of the second one-third of the stock options granted to Ms. Friedman in January of 2017. The company's fully diluted EPS growth exceeded the performance requirement, which resulted in the approval of the vesting of one-third of the 2017 option award, or 89,606 options. The calculation of the company's fully diluted EPS growth was adjusted to exclude certain extraordinary items recorded in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, including the tax reform benefit of $87 million in 2017 and the tax reform expense of $270 million in 2018. 
Settlement of 2016 PSU Grants Based on Relative TSR 
On January 29, 2019, the Management Compensation Committee evaluated and approved the performance results for the PSUs granted to senior executives in 2016. These PSUs were subject to a three-year cumulative performance period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2018 and performance was determined by comparing Nasdaq's TSR to two groups of companies, each weighted 50%. One group consisted of all S&P 500 companies and the other group consisted of 15 peer companies. We measure our TSR performance relative to two different groups in order to align with the varied interests of our stockholders. 
The following table sets forth the 2016 PSU performance measure results.

Throughout the performance periods for equity awards, the Management Compensation Committee receives updates on the executives' progress in achieving applicable performance measures. 
General Equity Award Grant Practices 
The Management Compensation Committee and the Board approve annual equity awards during regular first quarter meetings, which are scheduled well in advance and without regard to material company news announcements. 
We believe that the current and expected expense and share utilization are reasonable and justified in light of the Management Compensation Committee's goals of aligning the long-term interests of officers and employees with those of stockholders and rewarding officers for long-term relative TSR growth while retaining a strong management team. We actively monitor the expense and share utilization associated with annual grants and are committed to adjusting grant practices when appropriate. 
Throughout the performance periods for equity awards, the Management Compensation Committee receives updates on the executives' progress in achieving applicable performance measures and monitors the compensation expense and share run rate that the company is incurring for outstanding equity awards. 
The reference price for calculating the value of equity awards granted is the closing market price of Nasdaq's common stock on the date of grant. Existing equity ownership levels are not a factor in award determinations as we do not want to discourage senior executives from holding significant amounts of Nasdaq's common stock. 
Benefits 
Nasdaq provides a comprehensive benefits program to our executives, including the NEOs, which mirrors the program offered to our other employees. These benefits include, among other components, a 401(k) plan with 6% matching contributions, health and welfare benefits and an employee share purchase program. Under these plans, our NEOs participate on the same terms as other employees. 
Severance 
Except in employment agreements and other agreements for certain officers as described in this proxy statement, we are not obligated to pay general severance or other enhanced benefits to any NEO upon termination of his or her employment. However, the Management Compensation Committee and/or the Board has the discretion to pay severance. Severance plan decisions do not influence other compensation decisions, which are focused on motivating our executives to remain with Nasdaq and contribute to our future success. 
Change in control severance is defined in employment agreements for certain NEOs, as described in this proxy, and in a change in control severance policy for NEOs without an employment agreement. We believe that the terms for triggering payment under each of the arrangements described in this proxy statement are reasonable. For example, these arrangements use what is known as a "double trigger," meaning that a severance payment resulting from a change in control is activated only upon the occurrence of both a change in control of the company and a qualifying loss of employment. Benefits under these arrangements will be provided only if Nasdaq is the target organization.

[END TABLE]
 In addition, a change in control under these arrangements is limited to situations where the acquirer obtains a majority of Nasdaq's voting securities or the current members of our Board (or their approved successors) cease to constitute a majority of the Board. 
For further information on Nasdaq's limited severance arrangements, see "Named Executive Officer Compensation – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Other 
Because our executive compensation program emphasizes pay for performance, it includes few perquisites for our executives. Under her employment agreement, for security reasons, we provide Ms. Friedman with a company car and a security-trained driver for use when conducting company business. NEOs are eligible to receive basic financial planning services and executive health exams. In addition, like all employees and contractors, our executives are eligible to receive 100% corporate matching funds (and sometimes more for specific initiatives) for donations to an IRS-registered, 501(c)(3)-compliant organization. Participation in each of these programs is voluntary. We do not provide tax gross-up payments on perquisites. 
Risk Mitigation and Other Pay Practices 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Program 
We monitor the risks associated with our compensation program on an ongoing basis. In February 2019, the Management Compensation Committee and Audit Committee were presented with the results of an annual formal assessment of our employee compensation program in order to evaluate the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices. This risk assessment report reflected a comprehensive review and analysis of the components of our compensation program. The Management Compensation Committee and Audit Committee both concluded, based on the risk assessment report's findings, that any risks arising from our compensation program are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. 
The risk assessment was performed by an internal working group consisting of employees in the People@Nasdaq group, Group Risk Management and the Internal Audit Department, as well as the Offices of General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. The findings were presented to the Global Risk Management Committee, which concurred with the working group's report. The risk assessment included the following steps: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  collection and review of existing Nasdaq compensation policies and pay structures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  development of a risk assessment scorecard, analysis approach and timeline; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  review and evaluation of controls that might mitigate risk-taking (e.g., equity vesting structure, incentive  recoupment policy and stock ownership guidelines).

Stock Ownership Guidelines 
We have long recognized the importance of stock ownership as an essential means of closely aligning the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders. In addition to using equity awards as a primary long-term incentive compensation tool, we have stock ownership guidelines in place for our senior executives. Under its charter, the Management Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing the stock ownership guidelines annually and verifying compliance. 
Under the guidelines, the covered executives are expected to own specified dollar amounts of Nasdaq common stock based on a multiple of their base salary, as set forth in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Title       Value of Shares Owned   
     Title       Value of Shares Owned

     EVPs       3x base salary   
     EVPs       3x base salary   
[END TABLE]
Individual holdings, shares jointly owned with immediate family members or held in trust, shares or units of restricted stock (including vested and unvested), shares underlying PSUs after completion of the performance period and shares purchased or held through Nasdaq's plans, such as the Nasdaq ESPP, count toward satisfying the guidelines. New executives and executives who incur a material change in their responsibilities are expected to meet the applicable level of ownership within four years of their start date or the date of the change in responsibilities. All of the NEOs who were required to comply with the guidelines on December 31, 2018 were in compliance with the guidelines as of that date. 
Stock Holding Guidelines 
We encourage our senior executives to retain equity grants until the applicable stock ownership level discussed above is reached. Under the stock ownership guidelines, these officers must hold the specified dollar amounts of stock through the end of their employment with Nasdaq. We feel that our guidelines provide proper alignment of the interests of our management and our stockholders and therefore, we do not have additional stock holding requirements beyond the stock ownership guidelines. 
Trading Controls and Hedging and Pledging Policies 
We prohibit directors and executive officers from engaging in securities transactions that allow them either to insulate themselves, or profit, from a decline in Nasdaq's stock price (with the exception of selling shares outright). Specifically, these individuals may not enter into hedging transactions with respect to Nasdaq's common stock, including short sales and transactions in derivative securities. Finally, these individuals may not pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber their shares of Nasdaq common stock.

Nasdaq permits all employees, including the NEOs, to enter into plans established under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act enabling them to trade in our stock, including stock received through equity grants, during periods in which they might not otherwise be able to trade because material nonpublic information about Nasdaq has not been publicly released. These plans include specific instructions to a broker to trade on behalf of the employee if our stock price reaches a specified level or if certain other events occur and therefore, the employee no longer controls the decision to trade. 
Incentive Recoupment Policy 
The Board and Management Compensation Committee have adopted an incentive recoupment, or "clawback," policy that is applicable to officers with the rank of EVP and above. The policy provides that the company may recoup any cash or equity incentive payments predicated upon the achievement of financial results or operating metrics that are subsequently determined to be incorrect on account of material errors, material omissions, fraud or misconduct. 
Tax and Accounting Implications of Executive Compensation 
The Management Compensation Committee considers income tax and other consequences of individual compensation elements when it is analyzing the overall level of compensation and the mix of compensation among individual elements. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provided a limit of $1 million on the remuneration that may be deducted by a public company in any year in respect of the President and CEO and the next three most highly compensated executive officers (other than the principal financial officer). However, "performance-based compensation" was fully deductible if the plan under which the compensation was paid had been approved by the stockholders and met other requirements. We attempted to structure our compensation arrangements so that amounts paid are tax deductible to the extent feasible and consistent with our overall compensation objectives. 
Section 162(m) was amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017 and effective January 1, 2018. New Section 162(m) continues to provide a limit of $1 million on the remuneration that may be deducted by a public company; however, remuneration in any year in respect of the President and CEO, the principal financial officer and the next three most highly compensated executive officers is now considered. Also, under the new legislation, there is no exception for "performance-based compensation," unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. Such transition relief is not available to Nasdaq. Going forward, although "performance-based" criteria is no longer relevant in determining whether remuneration is deductible for tax purposes, the Management Compensation Committee intends to continue to apply performance-based criteria in structuring future compensation arrangements. 
We prohibit directors and executive officers from hedging and pledging shares of Nasdaq common stock.

Depending upon the relevant circumstances at the time, the Management Compensation Committee may determine to award compensation that is not deductible. In making this determination, the Management Compensation Committee balances the purposes and needs of our executive compensation program against potential tax and other implications. 
Generally, under U.S. GAAP, compensation is expensed as earned. We generally recognize compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. 
Management Compensation Committee Report 
The Management Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with our management. After such discussions, the Management Compensation Committee recommended to Nasdaq's Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into Nasdaq's annual report on Form 10-K.

2   The amounts reported in this column reflect the grant date fair value of the option awards computed  in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.

4   Amounts for 2018 for Ms. Friedman and Messrs. Knight and Wittman are not reported in this  column as there was a decrease in the actuarial present value of the NEOs' benefits under pension plans established by Nasdaq. The amounts of these decreases were as follows: $36,788 for Ms. Friedman, $180,537 for Mr. Knight and  $27,677 for Mr. Wittman. The amounts reported in this column for 2016 and 2017 reflect the actuarial increase in the present value of the NEOs' benefits under all pension plans established by Nasdaq. Messrs. Ptasznik and Peterson are not  participants in the pension plan. Assumptions used in calculating the amounts include a 4.45% discount rate as of December 31, 2018, a 3.70% discount rate as of December 31, 2017, a 4.15% discount rate as of December 31, 2016, a 4.30%  discount rate as of December 31, 2015, retirement at age 62 (which is the earliest age at which a participant may retire and receive unreduced benefits under the plans) and other assumptions used as described in note 10 to the company's  audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 included in our annual report on Form 10-K. Since Mr. Knight is older than 62, his actual age was used to calculate the  present value of his accumulated benefit. None of the NEOs received above-market or preferential earnings on deferred compensation in 2018, 2017 or 2016.

Retirement Plans 
Nasdaq maintains non-contributory, defined-benefit pension plans and non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plans for certain senior executives. Future service and salary for all participants do not count toward an accrual of benefits under these plans. However, participants continue to receive credit for future service for vesting of the frozen accrued benefits. 
Nasdaq also maintains a supplemental employer retirement contribution plan, which was designed to enhance retirement contributions for certain officers whose base salaries or total contributions to qualified plans exceeded certain IRS limitations. As of January 1, 2014, Nasdaq discontinued contributions to the supplemental employer retirement contribution plan. However, participants continue to receive interest on prior contributions to the plan. 
Nasdaq's frozen retirement plans reflect legacy agreements.

2   Since the pension plan and supplemental executive retirement plan were frozen in 2007, the number of  years of credited service for each NEO under those plans differs from such officer's number of years of actual service with Nasdaq. As of December 31, 2018, Ms Friedman had 22.42 years of actual service with Nasdaq, while Mr. Knight had  19.50 years and Mr. Wittman had 32.00 years. Generally, participants in the pension plan became vested in retirement benefits under the plan after five years of service from the participant's date of hire. Participants in the supplemental  executive retirement plan generally became vested in retirement benefits under the plan after reaching age 55 and completing 10 years of service. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Knight was vested in benefits payable under both the pension  plan and the supplemental executive retirement plan, and Ms. Friedman and Mr. Wittman were vested in benefits payable under the pension plan.

3   The amounts reported comprise the actuarial present value of the NEO's accumulated benefit  under the pension plan and supplemental executive retirement plan as of December 31, 2018. Assumptions used in calculating the amounts include a 4.45% discount rate as of December 31, 2018, retirement at age 62 (which is the earliest age  at which a participant may retire and receive unreduced benefits under the plans) and other assumptions used as described in note 10 to the company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 included in our  annual report on Form 10-K. Since Mr. Knight is older than 62, his actual age was used to calculate the present value of his accumulated benefit.

Employment Agreements 
Nasdaq currently has employment agreements with three of its NEOs: Ms. Friedman and Messrs. Knight and Peterson. In addition to the employment agreements, Nasdaq has entered into continuing obligations agreements with each of these officers related to confidentiality and intellectual property protection. 
Ms. Friedman's and Mr. Peterson's employment agreements prohibit them from rendering services to a competing entity for a period of two years following the last date of employment. To the extent Mr. Knight acts in a non-legal capacity during the last 12 months of his employment, his employment agreement prohibits him from rendering services to a competing entity for a period of two years following the last date of employment. To receive certain termination payments and benefits, Ms. Friedman and Messrs. Knight and Peterson must execute a general release of claims against Nasdaq. In addition, termination payments and benefits may be discontinued if the NEO breaches the restrictive covenants in either the employment agreement or the continuing obligations agreement. 
Each employment agreement for all three NEOs sets forth the payments and benefits that she or he will receive under various termination scenarios. For further information about these payments and benefits, see "Executive Compensation Tables – Potential Payments upon Termination and Change in Control."

Termination Due to Change in Control ("Double Trigger") 
All "change in control" payments and benefits are subject to a "double trigger," meaning that payments are made only when both a change in control of the company and a qualifying loss of employment occur.

Mr. Knight would also receive the same COBRA and other benefits coverage noted above for Ms. Friedman and Mr. Peterson. 
Change in Control Severance Plan 
Under the company's change in control severance plan, EVPs (including Messrs. Ptasznik and Wittman) are entitled to benefits in the event of a change in control.

[END TABLE]
Under a "best net provision," if amounts payable due to a change in control would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, payments or benefits to the executive would either be reduced to an amount that would not trigger an excise tax or the executive would receive all payments and benefits subject to the excise tax, whichever approach yields the best after-tax outcome for the executive officer. 
The change in control severance plan contains restrictive covenants, which, among other things, require the executive to maintain the confidentiality of the company's proprietary information and to refrain from disparaging the company. Each executive also is prohibited from soliciting the company's employees or rendering services to a competitor for one year following termination. Further, to receive the benefits, the executive must execute a general release of claims against the company. In addition, the change in control payments and benefits may be discontinued if the executive breaches the restrictive covenants. 
Equity Plan 
Under the Equity Plan, if outstanding awards are assumed or substituted by the successor company and an employee, including an NEO, is involuntarily terminated by the company other than for cause within a one-year period after a change in control, all unvested equity awards will vest on the termination date. For awards not assumed or substituted by the successor company, all unvested awards shall vest immediately prior to the effective time of the change in control. 
Estimated Termination or Change in Control Payments and Benefits 
The table on the following page reflects the payments and benefits payable to each NEO in the event of a termination of the executive's employment under several different circumstances. The amounts shown assume that termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, use the executive's compensation and service levels as of that date and are estimates of the amounts that would be payable to the NEOs in each situation. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of an executive's actual separation from the company. Factors that may affect the nature and amount of payments made on termination of employment, among others, include the timing of the event, compensation level, the market price of the company's common stock and the executive's age. Annual incentive amounts are shown at target. The reported value of the accelerated vesting of outstanding equity awards is based on the intrinsic value of these awards (the value based upon the market price of the company's common stock on December 31, 2018). The value of PSUs that continue to vest after termination is reported as if the grants vested at target on the termination date. The amounts shown in the table do not include payments and benefits available generally to salaried employees, such as accrued vacation pay, pension benefits and any death, disability or welfare benefits available under broad-based plans. For information on pension and deferred compensation plans, see the "2018 Pension Benefits Table" on page 96.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are required to disclose the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer, President and CEO Adena T. Friedman, and the ratio of these two amounts. 
Our methodology to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all employees included the following assumptions, adjustments and estimates. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  We identified the median employee by reviewing the 2018 actual total compensation (which consists of the  employee's base salary as of October 22, 2018, actual bonus paid in 2018 and grant date value of actual equity awards granted in 2018) of all full-time, part-time and hourly employees employed by us on October 22, 2018, a population  size of 4,049, as further illustrated in the graphic.  
[END TABLE]
NASDAQ'S GLOBAL WORKFORCE: 4,049 EMPLOYEES 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  In determining the CEO pay ratio for fiscal year 2018, we used October 22, 2018 as the determination date,  rather than October 5, 2017, which was the determination date we used in fiscal year 2017, because there were significant promotions and compensation changes that occurred earlier in October 2018, and we wanted to reflect the more current  compensation data.

  »  We annualized 2018 base cash compensation for full-time and part-time permanent employees who were hired after  January 1, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  All base cash compensation for employees outside the U.S. was converted to U.S. dollars based on a conversion rate  published in our internal human resources system that is updated annually.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  We did not make any cost-of-living  adjustments or full-time equivalent adjustments in identifying the median employee.  
[END TABLE]
Using this methodology, we determined that the median employee was an exempt, full time professional employee located in the U.S. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  The 2018 annual total compensation of Ms. Friedman was $14,366,397.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  Based on the same methodology we use for NEOs in the Summary Compensation Table, the 2018 annual total compensation  of the median employee was $111,155.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  The ratio of the 2018 annual total compensation of Ms. Friedman to the 2018 annual total compensation of the  median employee was 129 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
Our CEO pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC's rules. The SEC's rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies to identify the median employee. The SEC's rules also allow companies to exclude up to 5% of their workforce and make reasonable estimates and assumptions that may impact their employee populations. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above. Other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal 4 - Right to Act by Written Consent   Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors  undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were  present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any  topic for written consent consistent with applicable law.   Hundreds of  major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle.   This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in  a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic might have received a still higher vote than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if all  shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.   Taking action  by written consent in lieu of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. A shareholder right to act by written consent and to call a special meeting are 2 complimentary ways to bring  an important matter to the attention of both management and shareholders outside the annual meeting cycle. More than 100 Fortune 500 companies provide for shareholders to call special meetings and to act by written consent.   This proposal received 46%-support at our 2018 annual meeting. It would have  received more than 51% support if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.   The expectation is that shareholders will not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to  help ensue that our company is well supervised by the Board of Directors and management.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS' STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION 
Our Board carefully considered the advisory votes regarding similar proposals at our 2015, 2017 and 2018 annual meetings and concluded again that this proposal is not in the best interests of Nasdaq and its stockholders. This conclusion is consistent with that of our stockholders, large and small, who cast the majority of votes AGAINST the proposal at each of the annual meetings where it was presented. The Board therefore unanimously recommends that stockholders again vote AGAINST this proposal, as further explained below. 
Action by Written Consent Is Unnecessary 
Given the Ability of Stockholders to Call Special Meetings 
Stockholders holding as little as 15% of Nasdaq's voting power may call a special meeting of stockholders. This right permits Nasdaq's stockholders to effect change by bringing important matters before all stockholders for consideration in a fully transparent manner. Stockholder meetings offer important protections and advantages to all stockholders that are absent from the written consent process under this proposal. The protections and advantages of stockholder meetings include the following. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  All stockholders are provided with notice of the meeting and an opportunity to consider the proposed actions and  vote their shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  The meeting provides stockholders with a transparent forum for open discussion and consideration of the proposed  actions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  Accurate and complete information about the proposed actions is widely distributed well in advance of the meeting,  thereby encouraging a fully informed discussion and consideration of the merits of the proposed actions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  The Board is able to analyze the proposed actions and provide a well-informed recommendation on them.   
[END TABLE]
In this regard, Nasdaq notes that proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis has revised its policy concerning stockholder proposals on written consent. In cases like Nasdaq's where a company has adopted a special meeting right of 15% or below and has adopted reasonable proxy access provisions, Glass Lewis will generally recommend a vote against stockholder proposals regarding written consent. This change is consistent with Nasdaq's view that this proposal is unnecessary, given Nasdaq's corporate governance framework and practices. See pages 25-33.
Action by Written Consent Can Result in Secretive and Unsound Voting Processes, in Opposition to Nasdaq's 
Commitment to Transparent Decision Making 
In contrast to the open and transparent forum of a stockholder meeting, stockholder action by written consent, where there is no advance notice, discussion or debate, can result in secretive and unsound decision making by permitting a bare majority of stockholders to act alone. Therefore, a small group of stockholders, with no fiduciary duties to Nasdaq or other stockholders and without the knowledge or participation of other stockholders, could propose and take action, thereby disenfranchising minority stockholders. This could include action that is significant in nature, such as removing 
The Board believes that stockholder action by written consent, where there is no open meeting, advance notice, discussion or debate, may have adverse consequences to Nasdaq and its stockholders, including a lack of transparency and accountability and disenfranchisement of minority stockholders.

directors, amending the governance documents or acting on a proposal to sell our company, all without a stockholder meeting to consider the merits or consequences of that action. The Board believes that matters of sufficient importance to warrant action between annual stockholder meetings should not be decided in this manner. 
Action by Written Consent Could Create Confusion and Disruption for Stockholders and the Company 
The Board also believes that permitting stockholder action by written consent is not appropriate for a public company like Nasdaq. If permitted, multiple stockholder groups could solicit multiple written consents simultaneously, some of which may be duplicative or contradictory, which has the potential to create substantial confusion and disruption for stockholders and a significant encumbrance on the company's resources, including the time and attention of the Board, its executives and its employees. The Board believes these resources would be better spent developing and growing the company's business to increase long-term value for all stockholders. 
Nasdaq's Existing Corporate Governance Practices 
Emphasize Board Accountability and Provide Numerous 
Opportunities for Stockholder Action 
In addition to providing for stockholders' right to call special meetings, Nasdaq's existing corporate governance practices and policies emphasize Board accountability and give stockholders ample opportunity to take action at a properly called stockholders' meeting. Significant examples include the following. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  Proxy Access. In 2016, in response to feedback from stockholders, Nasdaq adopted a proxy access provision  that allows a stockholder (or group of stockholders) that complies with certain customary requirements to nominate candidates for service on the Board and have those candidates included in Nasdaq's proxy materials.

  »  Elimination of Supermajority Voting. In 2014, in response to feedback from stockholders, Nasdaq eliminated  all supermajority voting requirements from its governance documents.

Nasdaq has shown time and again that when it believes a particular action requested by a stockholder is in the best interests of all stockholders, the Board will support that action. In fact, many of the practices described above were adopted in response to stockholder feedback. Nasdaq believes that its corporate governance practices and policies enable stockholders to act in support of their interests while avoiding the risks associated with stockholder action by written consent. 
Substantially Identical Proposals Were Rejected by the Company's Stockholders in 2015, 2017 and 2018 
The Board has carefully considered the stockholder proposal in light of the rejection by Nasdaq's stockholders of substantially similar proposals submitted by the same proponent at three of the last four Annual Meetings of Stockholders. Our conversations with investors are consistent with the voting results on this issue – while some view written consent as an important right, the majority of our stockholders do not support adopting it. As a result, the Board continues to believe that the actions requested by the proponent are not in the best interests of Nasdaq and its stockholders and urges stockholders to reject the proposal. 
Summary 
As in 2015, 2017 and 2018, the Board believes that the stockholder proposal to allow stockholder action by written consent is inappropriate, unnecessary and not in the best interests of Nasdaq and its stockholders. 
Other Business 
The Nasdaq Board knows of no business other than the matters described in this proxy statement that will be presented at the Annual Meeting. To the extent that matters not known at this time may properly come before the Annual Meeting, absent instructions thereon to the contrary, the enclosed proxy will confer discretionary authority with respect to such other matters and it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote in accordance with their judgment on such other matters. 
Nasdaq's existing corporate governance practices emphasize board accountability and provide numerous opportunities for stockholder action.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act and regulations of the SEC thereunder require our directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of initial ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Based solely on our review of copies of such forms received by Nasdaq, or on written representations from reporting persons that no other reports were required for such persons, we believe that during 2018, our directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders complied with all of the Section 16(a) filing requirements. 
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
The table and accompanying footnotes on pages 117-118 show information regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of the record date by:

Except as otherwise indicated, we believe that the beneficial owners listed below, based on information furnished by such owners, will have sole investment and voting power with respect to such shares, subject to community property laws where applicable. All vested options, vested shares of restricted stock and vested shares underlying PSUs referred to in the table were granted under the Equity Plan. Shares of common stock underlying options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days are considered outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purposes of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Holders of RSUs and PSUs granted under the Equity Plan have the right to direct the voting of the shares underlying those RSUs and PSUs only to the extent the shares are vested. 
As of the record date, 165,416,806 shares of common stock were outstanding.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
The Audit Committee of the Board has adopted a written policy requiring notification, review and approval of related person transactions. Every two years, the Audit Committee reviews and approves the policy on related person transactions. 
Under the policy, all related person transactions are subject to ongoing review and approval or ratification by the Audit Committee. For purposes of the policy, a "related person" generally includes directors, director nominees, executive officers, greater than 5% stockholders, immediate family members of any of the foregoing and entities that are affiliated with any of the foregoing. 
Under the policy, related person transactions that are conducted in the ordinary course of Nasdaq's business and on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable services provided to unrelated third parties are considered pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The Transaction Review Committee (consisting of employees in Finance, Internal Audit, the Office of General Counsel and the Office of the Corporate Secretary) is responsible for determining if a transaction meets the pre-approval requirements. If the pre-approval requirements are not met, the transaction is referred to the Audit Committee for review and approval or ratification. 
In determining whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Audit Committee considers, among other things, the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  whether the terms of the related person transaction are fair to Nasdaq and whether such terms would be on the same  basis if the transaction did not involve a related person;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  whether there are business reasons for Nasdaq to enter into the related person transaction;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  whether the related person transaction would impair the independence of an outside director;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  whether the related person transaction would present a conflict of interest for any director or executive officer  of Nasdaq, taking into account:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the size of the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the overall financial position of the director or executive officer;

  »  whether the related person transaction aligns with Nasdaq's culture of integrity and potential reputational  risk implications.  
[END TABLE]
The following section describes certain transactions since the beginning of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, in which Nasdaq or any of its subsidiaries was a party, in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and in which a related person may have had, or may have, a direct or indirect material interest. In addition to the transactions described below, certain of our directors or director nominees are officers or partners of companies or private equity firms which, directly or through their controlled portfolio companies, enter into commercial transactions with Nasdaq or its subsidiaries from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that such directors or director nominees have a direct or indirect material interest in such transactions. In accordance with our policy, all such transactions, and the transactions discussed below, have been reviewed and approved or ratified by the Audit Committee of our Board or received pre-approval, as discussed above. 
Borse Dubai 
As of the record date, Borse Dubai owned approximately 18% of Nasdaq's common stock. Nasdaq is obligated by the terms of a stockholders' agreement with Borse Dubai to nominate and generally use best efforts to cause the election to the Nasdaq Board of one director designated by Borse Dubai, subject to certain conditions. Essa Kazim, the Chairman of Borse Dubai, has been designated by Borse Dubai as its nominee with respect to the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Nasdaq is party to several commercial agreements with Borse Dubai and/or its affiliates that were negotiated on an arms-length basis and entered into in the ordinary course of business. Under these agreements, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, Borse Dubai or its affiliates paid Nasdaq approximately $0.6 million primarily for market technology products and services, and Nasdaq paid Borse Dubai or its affiliates $0.1 million under a reseller agreement. In addition, in consideration for a release by Borse Dubai of certain potential contractual claims, Nasdaq began issuing a credit to Borse Dubai starting in the first quarter of 2017 for approximately $5 million to be applied toward certain technology services provided by Nasdaq. 
Investor AB 
As of the record date, Investor AB owned approximately 11.7% of Nasdaq's common stock. The terms of a stockholders' agreement between Nasdaq and Investor AB give Investor AB the right to nominate and generally use best efforts to cause the election to the Nasdaq Board of one director designated by Investor AB, subject to certain conditions. Jacob Wallenberg, the Chairman of Investor AB, has been designated by Investor AB as its nominee with respect to the 2019 Annual Meeting.

Questions and Answers 
About Our Annual Meeting 
1. What is included in the proxy materials? What is a proxy statement and what is a proxy? 
The proxy materials for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders include the notice of annual meeting, this proxy statement and the annual report on Form 10-K. We also will provide an interactive version of the proxy statement at http://ir.nasdaq.com/. If you received a paper copy of these materials, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or voting instruction form. 
A proxy statement is a document that SEC regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy involves your legal designation of another person to vote the stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated two of our officers as proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. These two officers are Edward S. Knight and Joan C. Conley. The form of proxy and this proxy statement have been approved by the Board and are being provided to stockholders by its authority. 
2. What different methods can I use to vote? 
You can vote by any of the following methods. 
By Internet. The notice of internet availability of proxy materials contains the website address (www.proxyvote.com) for internet proxy submission. Internet proxy submission is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. (EDT) on April 22, 2019. You must enter your control number, which is printed in the lower right-hand corner of the notice of internet availability, and you will be given the opportunity to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. 
By Phone. In the U.S. and Canada, you can vote your shares by calling +1 800 690 6903. Telephone proxy submission is available 24 hours a day until 11:59 p.m. (EDT) on April 22, 2019. When you submit a proxy by telephone, you will be required to enter your control number. You will then receive easy-to-follow voice prompts allowing you to instruct the proxy holders how to vote your shares and to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. If you are located outside the U.S. or Canada, you should instruct the proxy holders how to vote your shares by internet or by mail. 
By Mail. If you choose to submit a proxy by mail after requesting and receiving printed proxy materials, simply complete, sign and date your proxy card and return it in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
Attend the Annual Meeting. All stockholders may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, you will need to follow the instructions set forth in the answer to the next question.

3. What do I need to do to attend the Annual Meeting? 
If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, you must be a stockholder on the record date (February 25, 2019) and request an admission ticket in advance by visiting www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions provided; you will need the 12 digit number included on your proxy card, voter instruction form or notice. Tickets will be issued only to stockholders. Requests for admission tickets will be processed in the order in which they are received and must be requested no later than 11:59 p.m. (EDT) on April 22, 2019. Please note that seating is limited and requests for tickets will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. 
At the meeting, each stockholder will be required to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport, with their admission ticket. If you are a beneficial owner of Nasdaq shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you also will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the meeting. A recent brokerage statement or letter from the bank, broker or other nominee is an example of proof of ownership. If you want to vote in person and your Nasdaq shares are held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you will have to obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the holder of record. 
Directions to the Annual Meeting are available on our Annual Meeting Information webpage. Cameras (including cell phones with photographic capabilities), recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted. You may be required to enter through a security check point before being granted access to the meeting. 
We invite stockholders to submit written questions in advance of the meeting by visiting our stockholder forum at www.proxyvote.com. 
4. What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our registrar and transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a bank or brokerage account, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares. 
5. What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my broker? What is a broker non-vote? 
As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for vote. 
Discretionary Items. The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as independent registered public accounting firm is a discretionary item. Banks, brokers and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal at their discretion. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Non-Discretionary Items. All of the other proposals in this proxy statement are non-discretionary items. Banks, brokers and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners may not vote on these proposals, resulting in a "broker non-vote." 
If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee, it is important that you cast your vote if you want it to count on all of the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting. 
6. What proposals are to be voted on at the 2019 Annual 
Meeting of Stockholders, and what are the voting standards?

[END TABLE]
The proxy provides that each stockholder may vote his or her Nasdaq shares "For," "Against" or "Abstain" on individual nominees and each of the other proposals. Whichever method you select to transmit your instructions, the proxy holders will vote your shares as provided by those instructions. If you provide a proxy without specific voting instructions, the proxy holders will vote your Nasdaq shares in accordance with the Board recommendations noted above. 
The vote to approve executive compensation is advisory only and, therefore, the result of this vote will not be binding on our Board or Management Compensation Committee. Our Board and Management Compensation Committee will, however, consider the outcome of this vote when evaluating our executive compensation program in the future.

[END TABLE]
The stockholder proposal is precatory, meaning that it requests that the Board take a specific action, and therefore, the results of the vote on that proposal will not be binding on the Board. The Board will consider the outcome of the stockholder vote in considering next steps on this matter for the upcoming year. If the stockholder proposal is not properly presented by the proponent at the Annual Meeting, it will not be voted upon. 
7. What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares? 
You can change your vote by revoking your proxy at any time before it is exercised in one of three ways: submit a later dated proxy (including a proxy submitted through the internet at www.proxyvote.com, by telephone or by proxy card); notify Nasdaq's Corporate Secretary by email at corporatesecretary@nasdaq.com that you are revoking your proxy; or vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial owner of Nasdaq shares held by a bank, broker or other nominee, you will need to contact the bank, broker or other nominee to revoke your proxy. 
8. How many votes do I have? 
Each share of common stock has one vote, subject to the voting limitation in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that generally prohibits a stockholder from voting in excess of 5% of the total voting power of Nasdaq. 
9. Are votes confidential? 
Proxies, ballots and voting instruction forms are handled on a confidential basis to protect your voting privacy. This information will be disclosed only to those recording the vote, except if there is a proxy contest, if the stockholder authorizes disclosure, to defend legal claims or as otherwise required by law. Comments written on your proxy, ballot or voting instruction form are not confidential. 
10. What constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting? 
The presence of the holders of a majority (greater than 50%) of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting constitutes a quorum. Presence may be in person or by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present and entitled to vote at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. 
11. Who counts and tabulates the votes? 
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. counts and tabulates the votes and acts as the inspector of elections. 
12. When will the company announce the voting results? 
Preliminary results will be announced at the meeting and, thereafter, final results will be reported in a current report on Form 8-K, which is expected to be filed with the SEC within four business days after the meeting, and will be posted on http://ir.nasdaq.com.

13. How are proxies solicited, and what is the cost? 
Soliciting a proxy is the outreach to obtain the authorization of stockholders to vote on their behalf at a stockholder meeting. We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited on our behalf by directors, officers or employees (who will not receive any additional compensation for these solicitations), in person or by telephone, electronic transmission or facsimile transmission. Upon request, Nasdaq will reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees for their reasonable expenses in sending proxy materials to their customers and obtaining their proxies. 
Nasdaq has hired D.F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in soliciting proxies at a fee of $8,500, plus costs and expenses. 
14. What is "householding," and how does it affect me? 
Nasdaq has adopted a practice approved by the SEC known as "householding" to reduce printing and postage fees for the meeting notice. "Householding" means that stockholders who share the same last name and address will receive only one copy of the proxy materials, unless we receive instructions to the contrary from any stockholder at that address. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of the proxy materials to you if you contact us to provide such instructions at the following address, telephone number or email address: Nasdaq Investor Relations Department, Attention: Edward Ditmire, One Liberty Plaza, 49th Floor, New York, New York 10006; +1 212 401 8742; investor.relations@nasdaq.com. If you wish to receive separate copies of the proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy per household, you should contact your bank, broker, or other nominee record holder, or you may contact us at the above address, telephone number or email address. 
15. Will you make a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders available? 
A list of holders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available from April 1, 2019 through the Annual Meeting, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. (EDT), at our principal executive offices (One Liberty Plaza, 50th Floor, New York, New York 10006) and the meeting location (Nasdaq MarketSite, Four Times Square, New York, NY 10036).

Webcast participants also will be able to ask questions live through our online chat feature. An archived copy of the webcast will also be available on this website. 
17. How can I view or request copies of the company's corporate documents and SEC filings?

18. How do I submit a proposal or director nomination for inclusion in the 2020 proxy statement?
Nasdaq stockholders who wish to submit proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act for inclusion in the proxy statement for Nasdaq's 2020 Annual Meeting must submit them on or before November 13, 2019 to the Corporate Secretary and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8. 
Our By-Laws include a proxy access provision that permits a stockholder, or a group of stockholders, owning at least 3% of our outstanding shares of common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in the proxy materials for an Annual Meeting director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals and 25% of the total number of directors then in office, provided that the stockholder(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the By-Laws. Notice of director nominations submitted under these requirements must be received no earlier than October 14, 2019 and no later than November 13, 2019. 
In addition, Nasdaq stockholders may recommend individuals for consideration by the Nominating & Governance Committee for nomination to the Nasdaq Board. Holders should submit such recommendations in writing, together with any supporting documentation the holder deems appropriate, to Nasdaq's Corporate Secretary prior to January 31, 2020. 
19. How do I submit other proposals or director nominations for presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting? 
Our By-Laws also establish an advance notice procedure for other proposals or director nominations that are not submitted for inclusion in the proxy statement, but that a stockholder instead wishes to present directly at an Annual Meeting. Under these procedures, a stockholder must deliver a notice containing certain information, as set forth in the By-Laws, to Nasdaq's Corporate Secretary not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the prior year's meeting. Assuming the 2020 Annual Meeting is held according to this year's schedule, the notice must be delivered on or prior to the close of business on January 24, 2020, but no earlier than the close of business on December 25, 2019. However, if Nasdaq holds its Annual Meeting on a date that is more than 30 days before or 70 days after such anniversary date, the notice must be delivered no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of the Annual Meeting nor later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior to the date of the Annual Meeting or (ii) the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by Nasdaq.

Annex A 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we also have provided non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating performance. 
These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this proxy statement, as well as our annual report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone. 
We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. We use non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the periods presented below is calculated by adjusting for the following items. 
Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods, and the earnings power of Nasdaq. Performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization therefore provide investors with a more useful representation of our businesses' ongoing activity in each period. 
We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this proxy statement, as well as our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.

[END TABLE]
Merger and strategic initiatives expense: We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed a divestiture and a number of acquisitions in recent years that have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods. 
Clearing Default: For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $31 million in expense related to the clearing default of a Nasdaq Clearing commodities member that occurred in September 2018. We recorded an $8 million loss in September 2018 relating to this default. In December 2018, we recorded a $23 million charge as a result of initiating a capital relief program. These charges are recorded in general, administrative and other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. See "Nasdaq Commodities Clearing Default," of Note 15, "Clearing Operations," in Nasdaq's annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the default. We have excluded these charges as we believe they are non-recurring, as there has never been a loss due to member default in our clearinghouse, and they should be excluded when evaluating the ongoing operating performance of Nasdaq. Any expenses associated with the enhancement of processes and procedures relating to our clearing business will not be excluded from our GAAP results. 
Other significant items: We have excluded certain other charges or gains, including certain tax items, that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and investors to better understand the ongoing financial results of Nasdaq. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, other significant items primarily included:

Additional adjustments included the following items: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  the impact of newly enacted U.S. tax legislation is related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on  December 22, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an increase to tax expense of $290 million and a reduction to deferred tax assets related to foreign currency translation as a result of the finalization of the  provisional estimate related to this act. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a decrease to tax expense of $89 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability at the lower U.S. federal  corporate income tax rate, which reflected the provisional impact associated with the enactment of this act;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  the reversal of certain Swedish tax benefits. See Note 17, "Income Taxes," to the consolidated financial  statements in Nasdaq's annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »  excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation of $9 million for the year ended  December 31, 2018 and $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, were recorded as a result of the adoption of accounting guidance on January 1, 2017. This guidance requires all income tax effects of share-based awards to  be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled on a prospective basis, as opposed to stockholders' equity where it was previously recorded, and will be a recurring item going forward.  This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on the timing of the vesting of employee share-based compensation arrangements and fluctuation in our stock price.  
[END TABLE]
