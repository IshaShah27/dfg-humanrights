8 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION How We Are Selected Evaluated and Comprised Diversity The Board believes it is important for directors to possess a diverse array of backgrounds, skills, and achievements. When considering new candidates, the Nominating & Governance Committee, with input from the Board, takes these factors into account as well as other appropriate characteristics, such as sound judgment, honesty, and integrity. In addition, the Nominating & Governance Committee, when searching for nominees for directors, relies on the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, which state, "The Company endeavors to have a board representing diverse experience at policy-making levels in business areas that are relevant to the Company's global activities" and takes reasonable steps to include diverse candidates in the pool of nominees and any search firm engaged by the Committee are affirmatively instructed to seek diverse candidates. The goal is to assemble and maintain a Board comprised of individuals that not only bring to bear a wealth of business and/or technical expertise, but that also demonstrate a commitment to ethics in carrying out the Board's responsibilities with respect to oversight of the Company's operations. The matrix below outlines the diverse set of skills and expertise represented on the Company's Board:    Board of Directors Skills and Expertise Matrix Skills and Expertise     Deming Collins Cossé Dickerson Keller Kelley Mirosh Murphy Nolan Schmale Sugg Jenkins Former CEO• • • • • Senior Management/ Corporate Culture• • • • • • • • • • • Accounting/Audit• • • • • • Finance/Banking• • • • • Corporate Governance• • • • • • • • • Law• • • • • Government Relations/ Public Policy• • • • • Industry• • • • • • • • • • Operations• • • • • • • Environment, Health & Safety• • • • • • • • • Business Development & Corporate Strategy• • • • • • • • • • • Human Resources/ Compensation• • • • • • • • • Board of Directors• • • • • • • • • • • • Risk Management• • • • • • International Business• • • • • • •  2019 PROXY STATEMENT 9 Majority Voting The Company's belief in directors' accountability is evident in the provision in our Corporate Governance Guidelines providing that an incumbent director who fails to receive the required vote for re-election shall tender a resignation to the board. To the extent authorized by the proxies, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted in favor of the election of the twelve nominees for director whose names are set forth herein. If for any reason any of these nominees is not a candidate when the election occurs, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted for the election of the other nominees named and may be voted for any substituted nominees or the Board may reduce its size. However, management of the Company does not expect this to occur. All nominees were elected at the last Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Director and Nominee Independence The Company's belief in the importance of directors' independence is reflected by the fact that all directors other than Mr. Roger Jenkins have been deemed independent by the Board based on the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the standards of independence included in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. As part of its independence recommendation to the Board, the Nominating & Governance Committee at its February meeting considered familial relationships (Mr. Deming, Mr. Murphy and Ms. Keller are first cousins). The Committee also considered a parking lot lease agreement with The Murphy Foundation which was determined to be a fair market value transaction at the rate of $24,000 annually. The agreement went into effect in November 2018; therefore, the Company paid a total prorated amount of $4,000 to The Murphy Foundation for 2018. Mr. Deming, the independent Chairman of the Board, serves as presiding director at regularly scheduled board meetings as well as at no less than three meetings solely for non-employee directors. The meetings for non-employee directors are held in conjunction with the regularly scheduled February, August and December board meetings. If the Company had a non-employee director that was not independent, at least one of these meetings would include only independent non-employee directors. 
10 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION How We Are Organized and Operate Board Leadership Structure/Separate Chair and CEO Positions The positions of Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company are held by two individuals. Mr. Deming serves as the Chairman of the Board as a non-executive and independent director. Mr. Jenkins is the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Along with the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer, other directors bring different perspectives and roles to the Company's management, oversight and strategic development. The Company's directors bring experience and expertise from both inside and outside the Company and industry, while the Chief Executive Officer is most familiar with the Company's business and most capable of leading the execution of the Company's strategy. The Board believes that separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is currently in the best interest of stockholders because it provides the appropriate balance between strategy development and independent oversight of management. The Board will, however, maintain its flexibility to make this determination at any given point in time to provide appropriate leadership for the Company. Risk Management The Board exercises risk management oversight and control both directly and indirectly, the latter through various Board Committees. The Board regularly reviews information regarding the Company's credit, liquidity and operations, including the risks associated with each. The Executive Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to the Company's executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of financial risks and the ethical conduct of the Company's business, including the steps the Company has taken to monitor and mitigate these risks. The Nominating & Governance Committee, in its role of reviewing and maintaining the Company's corporate governance guidelines, manages risks associated with the independence of the Board and potential conflicts of interest. The Health, Safety & Environmental Committee oversees management of risks associated with environmental, health and safety issues. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed through committee reports and by management about the known risks to the strategy and the business of the Company. Committees The standing committees of the Board are the Executive Committee, the Audit Committee, the Executive Compensation Committee, the Nominating & Governance Committee and the Health, Safety & Environmental Committee. The Executive Committee, in accordance with the Company's by-laws, is vested with the authority to exercise certain functions of the Board when the Board is not in session. The Executive Committee is also in charge of all financial accounting, legal and general administrative affairs of the Company, subject to any limitations prescribed by the by-laws or by the Board. The Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint or replace the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also assists the Board with its oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence and performance, the performance of the Company's internal audit function, the compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements, and the review of programs related to compliance with the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Audit Committee meets with representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm and with members of the internal audit function for these purposes. In February 2018, the Board identified Lawrence R. Dickerson, R. Madison Murphy and Neal E. Schmale as qualified financial experts and designated Neal E. Schmale as its "Audit Committee Financial Expert" as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 11 All of the members of the Audit Committee including Mr. Schmale are independent under the rules of the NYSE and the Company's independence standards. The Executive Compensation Committee oversees the compensation of the Company's executives and directors and administers the Company's annual incentive compensation plan, the long-term incentive plan and the stock plan for non-employee directors. The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section contains additional information about the Executive Compensation Committee. In carrying out its duties, the Executive Compensation Committee will have direct access to outside advisors, independent compensation consultants and others to assist them. All of the members of the Executive Compensation Committee are independent under the rules of the NYSE and the Company's independence standards. The Health, Safety & Environmental Committee assists the Board and management in monitoring compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws, rules and regulations as well as the Company's Worldwide Health, Safety & Environmental Policy. Review of policies, procedures and practices regarding security of the Company's people and property is also within the purview of this committee. The Committee assists the Board on matters relating to the Company's response to evolving public issues affecting the Company in the realm of health, safety and the environment. The Committee has benefited from the Company's involvement with groups such as the American Petroleum Institute (API) and sponsorship of initiatives like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, which keeps abreast of emerging issues with respect to climate change. The Nominating & Governance Committee identifies and recommends potential Board members, recommends appointments to Board committees, oversees evaluation of the Board's performance and reviews and assesses the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the Company. All of the members of the Nominating & Governance Committee are independent under the rules of the NYSE and the Company's independence standards. Information regarding the process for evaluating and selecting potential director candidates, including those recommended by stockholders, is set out in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Stockholders desiring to recommend candidates for membership on the Board for consideration by the Nominating & Governance Committee should address their recommendations to: Nominating & Governance Committee of the Board of Directors, c/o Corporate Secretary, Murphy Oil Corporation, P.O. Box 7000, El Dorado, Arkansas 71731-7000. As a matter of policy, candidates recommended by stockholders are evaluated on the same basis as candidates recommended by Board members, executive search firms or other sources. Committee Charters Charters for the Audit, Executive Compensation, Nominating & Governance and Health, Safety & Environmental Committees, along with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Code of Ethical Conduct for Executive Management, are available on the Company's website, http://ir.murphyoilcorp.com/phoenix. zhtml?c=61237&p=irol-govHighlights. Board and Committee Evaluations Our Board of Directors recognize that a thorough evaluation process is an important element of corporate governance and enhances our Board's effectiveness. Therefore, each year, the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of each Board Committee request that the directors provide their assessment of the effectiveness of the full Board and each of the committees on which they serve. The Corporate Secretary is instructed by each Chairman to manage the distribution and collection of the individual assessment forms which is conducted electronically through a third-party vendor portal. Once each director submits their completed assessment(s) through the portal, the responses are organized and summarized by the Corporate Secretary and provided to each Chairman for review and discussion at the next scheduled meeting during executive session. It should be noted that the Board and each Board Committee reviews the adequacy of its own self-evaluation, but the Nominating & Governance Committee is charged with ensuring the adequacy of the entire process. Thus, each year, the Nominating & Governance Committee reviews and determines if each form stimulates thought about the Board and each Committee's function and provides a forum for feedback on areas of improvement.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT 13 How We Are Compensated The Company's standard arrangement for the compensation of non-employee directors divides remuneration into cash and equity components. This approach aligns the interests of directors and the stockholders they represent. The Company further targets total director compensation at a level near the 50th percentile of the competitive market (as determined by our Executive Compensation Committee (the "Committee") together with its independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance")), enhancing the Company's ability to retain and recruit qualified individuals. Directors can elect to defer their cash compensation into the Company's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("NED DCP Plan") which was approved by the Board of Directors on February 3, 2016. Deferred amounts are deemed to be notionally invested through a fund in the Company's stock. The "Fees Earned or Paid in Cash" column in the 2018 Director Compensation Table on the next page includes any amounts that were voluntarily deferred into the NED DCP Plan. Mr. Mirosh (Canadian citizen) does not have the opportunity to defer cash compensation in this manner. In 2018, the cash component consisted of an annual retainer of $60,000, plus $2,000 for each Board or committee meeting attended. Supplemental retainers were paid to the Chairman of the Board ($115,000), Audit Committee Chairman ($25,000), the Audit Committee Financial Expert ($10,000), other members of the Audit Committee ($7,500) and the Chair of each other committee ($15,000). In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved increases to the annual retainers for certain committee leadership positions. The Audit Committee Chairman retainer increased by $10,000, while the Executive Committee, Health Safety & Environmental and Nominating & Governance Chairman retainers increased by $5,000. The Company also reimburses directors for reasonable travel, lodging and related expenses they incur in attending Board and committee meetings. Also, in 2018. the total equity compensation for non-employee directors was maintained at a grant date fair value of $200,000 to keep the total director compensation near the 50th percentile of the Company's peer group, enhancing the Company's ability to retain and recruit qualified individuals. Each non-employee director received 7,073 time-based restricted stock units on February 7, 2018, which cliff vest after three years. The non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the matching charitable gift program on the same terms as Murphy employees. Under this program, an eligible person's total charitable gifts of up to $12,500 per calendar year will qualify. The Company will contribute to qualified educational institutions and hospitals an amount equal to twice the amount (2 to 1) contributed by the eligible person. The Company will contribute to qualified welfare and cultural organizations an amount equal to (1 to 1) the contribution made by the eligible person. Those amounts are in the column below showing "All Other Compensation".

At that time, then current directors were vested based on their years of service, with no further benefits accruing and benefits being paid out according to the terms of the plan. 4 The director elected to defer payment of such amounts under the Murphy Oil Corporation NED DCP Plan. 5 Where the annual change in accumulated benefits was negative, it was excluded from this column and from the Director Compensation Table Total column. Amounts were negative for 2018 for Mr. Murphy (-$12,464). 14 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION

16 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION PROPOSAL 2 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation THE BOARDS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 17 PROPOSAL 2 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("the Dodd-Frank Act") enables the Company's stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. The Company has determined to submit Named Executive Officer compensation to an advisory (non-binding) vote annually. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, stockholders endorsed the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers with over 92% of the votes cast supporting the proposal. As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the Company's executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate, and retain the Named Executive Officers who are critical to the Company's success. Under these programs, the Named Executive Officers are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals, corporate goals, and the realization of increased stockholder value. Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" along with the information in the compensation tables for additional details about the executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal year 2018 compensation of the Named Executive Officers. Stockholders are asked to indicate their support for the Named Executive Officer compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the Named Executive Officers' compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of the Named Executive Officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, stockholders are requested to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: "RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosures." The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Executive Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors and the Executive Compensation Committee value the opinions of stockholders and to the extent there is a significant vote against the Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Executive Compensation Committee will consider stockholders' concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
18 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION Compensation Discussion and Analysis Background Murphy Oil Corporation is an independent exploration and production ("E&P") company with a portfolio of global offshore and North American onshore assets delivering high margin production. Murphy produces oil and natural gas in the United States, Canada and Malaysia. The Company's long-term strategy as an oil-weighted independent E&P company is focused on the following key priorities that management believes will drive value for its stockholders: 1 develop differentiated perspectives in underexplored basins and plays; 2 continue to be a preferred partner to national oil companies and regional independents; 3 provide balance to the global offshore business by developing unconventional onshore plays in North America; 4 develop and produce fields in a safe, responsible, timely and cost effective manner; and 5 achieve and maintain a sustainable, profitable, high margin portfolio. This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") provides stockholders with an understanding of the Company's compensation philosophy, objectives, policies and practices in place during 2018, as well as factors considered by the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (referred to in this CD&A as the "Committee") in making compensation decisions for 2018. For your reference, the Company's CD&A is outlined in the following sections: Executive Summary 19 The Company's 2018 Operational and Financial Highlights 20 Impact of 2018 Company Performance on Executive Compensation 20 Actions Related to 2018 Performance 21 CEO Compensation 22 Stockholder Engagement 22 Compensation and Corporate Governance Policies 24 What We Do 24 What We Don't Do 25 Elements of Compensation 26 A.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT 19 Executive Summary This CD&A focuses on the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") listed below, whose compensation is set forth in the Summary Compensation table and other compensation tables contained in the proxy statement.    Name     Title Roger W. Jenkins President & Chief Executive Officer David R. Looney Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer John W. Eckart Retired Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer Eugene T. Coleman Executive Vice President, Exploration and Business Development Michael K. McFadyen Executive Vice President, Offshore Walter K. Compton Executive Vice President & General Counsel Effective March 2018, Mr. Eckart relinquished his position as Chief Financial Officer and Mr. Looney was named Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at that time. Mr. Eckart officially retired from the Company as Executive Vice President effective May 31, 2018. The Company's compensation plans and practices are designed to align the financial interests of the above NEOs with the financial interests of its stockholders. To that end, NEOs are provided with a competitive base salary, an annual cash bonus opportunity based on the achievement of specific goals aligned with stockholder value creation and long-term incentives. 
20 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION The Company's 2018 Operational and Financial Highlights Fiscal year 2018 was an excellent year for Murphy Oil, both operationally and financially. The Company's strong results in 2018 demonstrated our commitment to a diversified portfolio as oil-weighted production from both the Company's onshore and offshore assets continued to generate high margin realizations and cash flows. Our financial1 and operational highlights include: Growing net income from continuing operations before income taxes from $71.8 million in 2017 to $423.9 million in 2018 Returning 14% of operating cash flow to stockholders through long-standing dividend policy Preserved balance sheet strength with approximately 37 percent net debt to total capital* Receiving credit rating upgrades from Moody's and Fitch Closing $1.6 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, with more favorable covenants Increasing our proved reserves by 17% to 816 million barrels oil equivalent, with 57% liquids-weighting Achieving 166% organic reserve replacement with a finding and development cost of $10.92 per barrel of oil equivalent Maintaining reserve life index in excess of 10 years Producing 171 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day, a 4% increase from the prior year Increasing production in the Kaybob Duvernay to over 8,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day    In the fourth quarter of 2018, Murphy announced the completion of a transaction with Petrobras Americas Inc. (PAI) which became effective October 1, 2018. Through this transaction, Murphy acquired PAI's producing Gulf of Mexico assets along with certain blocks that hold deep exploration rights. Under the terms of the transaction, Murphy paid cash consideration of $795 million and transferred a 20% interest in MP Gulf of Mexico, LLC (MP GOM), a subsidiary of Murphy, to PAI. Following closing of the transaction, MP GOM is owned 80% by Murphy and 20% by PAI, with Murphy overseeing the operations. Impact of 2018 Company Performance on Executive Compensation Murphy has structured its cash and equity-based compensation program to position approximately 90% of the CEO's and 80%-85% of the other NEO's target total direct compensation opportunity in variable compensation components tied to the achievement of short- and long-term performance criteria aligned with the Company's business objectives. Short-term incentives are paid in the form of annual cash bonus opportunities tied to the achievement of specific performance goals aligned with stockholder value creation. Long-term incentives combine performance-based restricted stock units (referred to in this CD&A as "PSUs") and time-based restricted stock units (referred to in this CD&A as "RSUs") to provide a compensation opportunity aligned with the Company's long-term stock performance, delivered through awards that are performance based in absolute and relative terms, while also encouraging retention. 1 Unless otherwise noted, the financial and operating highlights and metrics discussed below exclude noncontrolling interest, thereby representing only the amounts attributable to Murphy. * See Annex for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most closely comparable GAAP metric. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 21 Actions Related to 2018 Performance Base Salary Adjustments to CEO & NEO Base Salaries The Company provides base salaries to its NEOs which are structured to reward executives for the performance of their regular duties and responsibilities associated with their management of the organization. Murphy targets the 50th percentile (median) level of base salaries paid by a select group of 10 peer companies in the exploration and production sector. During 2018, the Committee approved adjustments to the base salaries for the CEO and other NEOs effective as of February 1, 2018: Messrs. Jenkins, and Coleman each received 2.5% adjustments. Mr. Compton and Mr. Eckart received adjustments of 5.0% and 10% respectively to bring their base salaries closer to the midpoint of the Company's peer group Mr. McFadyen received a 2.5% adjustment to his base salary (which was paid in Canadian dollars) at that time. Upon his role transition to EVP, Offshore, in September 2018, he was awarded an increase in base salary. His total increase in base salary for 2018 was approximately 19%, which included currency translation adjustments.    Annual Incentives Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP") Awards Paid Above Target For the fiscal year 2018, the Committee modified the AIP performance metrics to increase the profile for the role of capital efficiency and financial discipline and for 2018 measured performance in the following areas: 25%-EBITDA/Average Capital Employed; 20%-Lease Operating Expense (LOE)/ Barrel of Oil Equivalent (BOE); 7.5%-Safety (Total Recordable Incident Rate); 7.5%-Environmental (Spill Rate); 20%-Production (BOEPD); and 20%-Produced Reserve Replacement (organic)    Below we provide an expanded discussion of the factors underlying our performance target setting process. Based upon the Company's performance during fiscal year 2018, Murphy met or exceeded the performance goals in three of the six areas measured. The AIP formula for the NEO positions resulted in an earned performance score of 151.24% of target. Long-Term Equity Incentives Long-Term Incentives Granted at Target Levels for 2018 In February 2018, the Committee approved long-term incentive grants with target award opportunities for each NEO based upon the 50th percentile competitive market practice and a return to the Company's target market positioning for long-term incentive awards after grants in the previous year were made below the market median. The 2018 long-term incentive mix was: 75% PSUs tied to relative TSR 25% in time-vested RSUs    The Committee determined that stock options would not be included as part of the 2018 long-term compensation mix in order to align with current market practice. PSUs granted in 2018 measured TSR under three separate annual periods and one cumulative three-year period. In 2019, awards were based solely on three-year performance and payouts are capped at target for negative TSR. The following provides a summary of the results for fiscal year 2018 based on relative TSR performance and the impact of such performance upon grants occurring in 2016, 2017, and 2018.    PSUs (%)     2016 2017 2018 Year 1 122.0 139.4 123.0 Year 2 139.4 123.0 TBD Year 3 123.0 TBD TBD Cumulative Years 1-3 150.0 TBD TBD Total 133.6 TBD TBD TSR 2016 2017 2018 2016 -2018 Performance 45.68% -6.65% -6.36% 8.39% Peer Group Rank 6 /17 4 / 17 6 / 17 3 / 17 
22 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION CEO Compensation The CEO received a nominal increase in base salary for 2018, which represents the first adjustment to his base salary rate in three years. Throughout the past three years, the CEO has effectively managed the Company through a difficult downturn in oil and natural gas prices, and the Committee elected to keep his base salary fixed at its current rate throughout the period. It was the Committee's judgment that the CEO's management of the Company's improved financial results in 2018, including a more than five times growth in Company annual operating income to $423.9 million, realizing a Company annual EBITDA to average capital employed ratio of 21%, increasing the Company's proved reserves by 17% over the prior year, and increasing the Company's production rate by 4% to 816 million barrels oil equivalent warranted a modest adjustment in base salary compensation of 2.5% for the 2018 performance year. Mr. Jenkins' annual incentive award (cash bonus, payable in first quarter 2019) was paid at the level of $2,500,000, which represents approximately 139% of his target award opportunity, a level commensurate with those of other plan participants. In February 2018, the Committee granted the CEO long-term incentive compensation with a grant date fair value of $9,286,113. This was higher than his 2017 equity grant value due to the Company's grant strategy in 2018 to return to market value at the 50th percentile for executive long-term award opportunities, as compared to 2017 grant values which were depressed in recognition of disappointing financial results and returns to stockholders. In aggregate, Mr. Jenkins' total direct compensation for 2018 was $13,115,919 which is an approximate 20% increase in total compensation from his 2017 level of $10,940,298. Stockholder Engagement The Company values the feedback and insights that it receives from its stockholders through ongoing dialogue. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, a proposal seeking an advisory vote on executive compensation for the Company's NEOs (see "Tabular Information for Named Executive Officers") was submitted to stockholders. Stockholders endorsed the Company's NEO compensation, with over 92% of the votes cast indicating approval. Even in years of strong say-on-pay support, we engage with our stockholders on a regular basis to ensure we fully understand the factors they consider to be most important when evaluating our company. During 2018, in addition to regular discussions with stockholders regarding our financial results, members of executive management proactively engaged in discussions with institutional investors soliciting investors' input regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the Company's strategy, corporate governance, executive compensation and sustainability. Murphy extended the opportunity for one-on-one discussions with the 25 largest institutional investors holding significant ownership interests in Murphy. A number of significant investors responded favorably to the opportunity to share their views and provided meaningful input. As a result of these discussions, the Executive Compensation Committee enhanced a number of elements of our executive compensation program, as well as our proxy disclosure. These changes occurred during the remainder of 2018 and during the first quarter of 2019. Enhancements to the executive compensation program have included the following: Clarification of the Performance Metrics and Goal- Setting in the Annual Incentive Plan On May 1, 2018, Murphy filed a Form 8-K clarifying how the 2017 annual incentive performance goals are established each year pursuant to the annual incentive plan. The Company explained how the performance goals were set in response to market forces such as commodity pricing and were reflective of expected lower production rates and returns attributed to a reduction in field development capital and asset divestitures. As a result of these considerations and performance goals which were set at levels below the prior year's results, Murphy elected to reduce its capital expenditures in order to be better stewards of the Company's capital resources. This year, we are continuing to provide an expanded discussion of the factors underlying our annual incentive goal setting for 2018 awards. See page 27 for details. Longer performance measurement period for PSUs The Company has changed its performance measurement period for its performance-based restricted stock unit awards. The former plan design included four equally weighted measurement periods: year 1; year 2; year 3; and years 1-3 combined. Beginning with the 2019 awards under the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2018 LTI Plan"), a new measurement period of 36 months will be implemented. The performance metric remains as relative TSR of Murphy versus its designated industry peer group. This change in the measurement period has been made in recognition that stockholders may be more focused on demonstrated longer-term performance cycles. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 23 Limit on PSU vesting for negative TSR The Company has added a new provision to the long-term incentive grants beginning in February 2019 that includes a vesting cap on PSU awards should the Murphy TSR be negative over the three-year performance cycle. Even if the Murphy relative TSR performance may result in an above-target payout opportunity greater than 100% of the number of PSUs granted, the new plan design caps the number of PSUs earned to 100% of the number of PSUs granted. Adoption of Double Trigger Vesting of Long-Term Incentives in Event of Change-in-Control (CIC) Beginning with equity grants made in February 2019, we no longer provide for accelerated vesting of long-term incentive compensation grants to the CEO and seven executive officers, including NEOs, who are direct reports to the CEO position upon the event of a Company CIC. Instead, grants made in February 2019 and after will be subject to a new policy that requires two defined triggers: (i) the Company experiences a CIC (as defined and set forth in the applicable long-term incentive documents); and (ii) the CEO and his direct reports, including NEOs, experiences an involuntary termination of employment or terminates employment for stated good reason upon or during a set period following the CIC. Adoption of a Single Peer Group In recent years, Murphy has relied upon two different sets of peer companies for benchmarking and financial analyses: a Compensation Peer Group used for benchmarking executive compensation and non-employee director compensation and TSR Peer Group used for the relative benchmarking of Murphy's TSR for purposes of the Murphy long-term incentive performance plan. There was considerable, but not total, overlap between the two groups. Throughout 2018 and into the first quarter of 2019, the Executive Compensation Committee analyzed 28 exploration and production companies for potential inclusion of a new group of companies and approved a new single peer group of 16 companies and Murphy intends to use a single peer group going forward. The new peer group has been included as the identified TSR performance measurement peer group with respect to the new long-term performance plan grants awarded to NEOs in February 2019. Please see page 36 of this CD&A for identification of the new peer group. Implementation of New CIC Severance for NEOs When reviewing peer CIC-related compensation practices, the Committee determined that the Murphy's CIC-related cash severance benefits were not competitive with our peers. In February 2019, the Company extended enhanced CIC coverage to seven executive officers who are direct reports to the CEO position. Such prospective severance compensation, payable to executives only in the events of both a CIC and a qualifying employee termination, is benchmarked to the 50th percentile of severance compensation levels of companies in Murphy's industry sector. 
24 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION Compensation and Corporate Governance Policies Stock Ownership Guidelines Directors are required to own and hold Company shares equal in value to five times their annual cash retainer. Officers of the Company or any of its operating subsidiaries are expected to own and hold a number of shares at least equal in value to a multiple of base salary, depending upon the officer's position (5.0 times for the CEO, 2.5 times for EVPs, 2.0 times for SVPs, and 1.0 times for VPs). Pay for Performance At least 75% of each NEO's target direct compensation is in the form of variable compensation tied to Company performance through the annual incentive and long-term incentive compensation plans. PSUs, comprise 75% of equity awards, are tied to multi-year performance goals and may not be earned above target if TSR over the performance period is negative. Anti-Hedging Policy Directors, officers, and employees are prohibited from engaging in any hedging transactions (including transactions involving options, puts, calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds, or other derivatives) that are designed to hedge or speculate on any change in the market value of the Company's securities. Limited Perquisites The Company's executive officers, including the NEOs, receive no perquisites or special executive benefits, unless such benefits serve a reasonable purpose, such as limited use of Company aircraft by the CEO. Clawback Provision In connection with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company has adopted a policy allowing for the recovery of incentive-based compensation under certain circumstances including a potential restatement of Company financial statements. Independent Compensation Advisor The Committee of the Board has retained the services of Pay Governance as its independent advisor regarding executive compensation issues facing the Committee. Pay Governance provides no other services to Murphy or the Committee beyond its executive compensation advisory services. Annual Stockholder Say-on-Pay Vote Since the inception of the stockholder advisory vote regarding Say-on-Pay, Murphy has allowed for such a vote annually and has received a highly favorable (92% or higher) voting result each year. Stockholder engagement The Company engages with stockholders on a regular basis to fully understand the factors considered most important when evaluating the Company. Double trigger CIC provisions Equity awards granted on or after February 2019 to the CEO and seven executives reporting to the CEO, including NEOs, require a qualifying termination in order to be eligible to accelerate vesting following a CIC. Cash severance following a CIC is also double trigger. "What We Do" and "What We Don't Do" Murphy is committed to developing and implementing executive compensation and corporate governance policies which are directly aligned with the best interests of our stockholders. In this regard, we have adopted executive compensation practices which are considered to be "best practices" and which will ensure that we have put stockholder interests at the forefront. The following table lists the practices that Murphy has implemented which describe the best practices we have adopted as "What We Do" as well as a listing of practices identified as "What We Don't Do" that we consider not to be aligned with our stockholders' interests. What We Do 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 25 What We Don't Do No Employment Agreements The Company does not have written employment agreements specifying compensation levels and practices for its CEO and NEOs or any Company employee. Beginning in 2019, the only written agreement in effect is the Company's change in control (CIC) protection for the CEO and 7 other key employees (which includes NEOs) in the form of a Severance Protection Agreement which is only operative in the event that the CEO or executive is involuntarily terminated without cause or terminates for specified good reason following a CIC transaction. No Tax Gross-Up Payments The Company does not provide its CEO or other NEOs with tax gross-up payments for any form of executive compensation, including the CIC severance compensation for the CEO. No Backdating of Stock Options Murphy has never engaged in the practice of backdating stock options or other forms of equity compensation. No Payment of Dividends on Unearned Performance Awards With respect to unearned long-term performance awards measured or paid in Company stock, the grantee will not receive dividends pursuant to such granted awards until such stock is earned and/or paid. No Above-Median Benchmarking All elements of total direct executive compensation (base salary, target annual incentive, and target long-term incentives) are benchmarked at the 50th percentile of our peers or the competitive market. No Pledging of Shares Unless Stock Ownership Guidelines are Met A director or officer may not pledge Company securities, including the purchasing of Company securities on margin or holding Company securities in a margin account, until he or she has achieved the applicable stock ownership target specified in the guidelines above. Any pledging of shares must be in compliance with applicable law and should be disclosed to the Company in advance No Payment of Awards Greater Than Target in Event of Negative TSR During the 3-Year LTI Performance Period Under the design provisions of the revised long-term incentive compensation program applicable to grants of PSUs, in the event that the Company's TSR is negative over the applicable measurement period but results in relative performance greater than the median of its peers, the awards and payments of PSUs earned will be capped at the target level. 
26 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION Elements of Compensation The Company's executive compensation program includes a base salary, participation in an annual cash-based incentive plan, long-term incentive compensation, employee benefits and limited perquisites. The Committee believes that a majority of an executive officer's total direct compensation opportunity (which includes base salary, annual and long-term incentive opportunities) should be performance-based. The Committee determines an executive's total direct compensation opportunity based on compensation peer company information and survey data provided by Pay Governance to ensure the program is competitive with the compensation peer group in order to attract and retain talented executives. A. Base Salary The objectives of the base salary component of compensation are: 1 to provide a fixed level of compensation to compensate the executive for day-to-day execution of primary duties and responsibilities; 2 to assist the Company in the attraction and retention of a highly skilled competitive leadership team by paying base salaries competitive with those paid by the Company's compensation peer group; and 3 to provide a foundation level of compensation upon which incentive opportunities can be added to provide the motivation to deliver superior performance. The Company targets the median ("50th percentile") of competitive market pay levels for the base salary of the NEOs because it allows the organization to recruit, attract, and retain qualified management talent having the requisite skills and competencies to manage the Company and to deliver additional value for stockholders. In practice, some executives are paid above or below the 50th percentile because of their individual job performance, time in the position, and/or tenure with the Company. Executives' salaries are ultimately determined based on the market pay levels, as well as a combination of experience, duties and responsibilities, individual performance, Company performance, general economic conditions and marketplace compensation trends. In February 2018, the Committee approved adjustments to the base salaries for the NEOs effective as of February 1, 2018: Messrs. Jenkins, Coleman, and McFadyen each received 2.5% adjustments, Mr. Compton received a 5.0% adjustment to bring his base salary closer to the midpoint of the Company's peer group. Mr. Eckart received a 10.0% adjustment effective as of January 1, 2018 as part of the Company's phased approach to bring his base salary closer to the midpoint of the Company's peer group based on data provided by Pay Governance. Upon his role transition to EVP of Offshore in September 2018, and in recognition of this promotion and increase in responsibilities, Mr. McFadyen's total increase in base salary for 2018 was approximately 19%, which included currency translation adjustments.

He relinquished his position as Chief Financial Officer effective March 1, 2018 and retired from the Company as Executive Vice President on May 31, 2018. 3 This amount includes an adjustment on February 1, 2018 and on September 1, 2018 when Mr. McFadyen transitioned to EVP of Offshore. The total increase also includes currency translation adjustments.    B. Annual Incentive Plan The objectives of the Company's annual incentive program are: 1 to provide cash-based incentive compensation linked to Company performance to those officers, executives, and key employees who contribute significantly to the growth and success of the Company; 2 to attract and retain individuals of outstanding ability; 3 to align the interests of those who hold positions of major responsibility in the Company with the interests of the Company's stockholders; and 4 to encourage excellent operational performance by rewarding executives when they achieve this level of performance. The Committee targets the 50th percentile of competitive market pay levels for its annual target incentive to motivate its executives. Executives have the opportunity to be compensated above the median of market pay levels when the Company has above market performance based on established performance measures. In February 2018, the Committee reviewed an analysis of the top executives prepared by Pay Governance and approved adjustments, where necessary, to bring target bonus percentages in line with the market. For 2018, the target bonus percentages of the Company's NEOs were at the median of the competitive market. The 2017 Annual Incentive Plan (the "2017 Plan") provides the Committee with a list of performance criteria to be used for determination of performance-based awards. For 2018, the performance criteria, approved by the Committee, was modified from the criteria used in the prior year to increase the profile for the role of capital efficiency and financial discipline by replacing EBITDA/BOE with EBITDA/Average Capital Employed. 
28 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION PERFORMANCE METRICS AND WEIGHTINGS    2018 Performance Criteria Metric     Weighting Definition Safety Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) 7.5% Defined as the combined number of incidents for both contractors and employees worldwide per 200,000 work hours. The lower the result, the better the performance. The health and safety of the Company's employees and contractors is important to the Company. Inclusion of a safety metric reflects the Company's emphasis on safe operations by both employees and contractors. Environmental Spill Rate 7.5% Defined as the number of spills equal to or greater than one barrel per million BOEs1 produced. Like TRIR, the lower the spill rate, the better our environmental performance. Inclusion of a spill metric reflects the Company's commitment to environmentally sound operations. Financial EBITDA/Average Capital Employed1 Lease Operating Expense ("LOE")/BOE2 25% 20% These financial goals focus on financial discipline and encourage employees to manage costs relative to gross margins and the commodity price environment. Operational Produced Reserves Replacement (organic) Production Target (BOEPD)3 20% 20% The primary business objectives for an exploration and production company are to find oil and natural gas reserves at a competitive cost while generating economic value for its stockholders and assuring that reserves are prudently converted into production and ultimately cash flow. Including specific operational goals on reserves additions (excluding acquisitions and divestitures) and production volumes provides a direct line of sight for the Company's employees of their impact in the Company's operational success. 1 EBITDA/Average Capital Employed is calculated by dividing the Company's EBITDA by the sum of the opening plus closing Capital Employed (total equity + total long-term debt + total short-term debt) divided by two. 2 A barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) is a term used to summarize the amount of energy that is equivalent to the amount of energy found in one barrel of crude oil. One barrel of oil is generally deemed to have the same amount of energy content as 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas. 3 Barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) is a term that is used in conjunction with the production or distribution of oil and natural gas.    PERFORMANCE TARGETS AND GOAL SETTING PROCESS With respect to the NEOs, the following table summarizes the performance metrics, respective weighting of performance metrics and weighted performance scores based on actual performance, used in determining their respective annual incentive awards for 2018. The stretched targets for performance metrics were primarily based on historical data, budgets and forecasts. 
Under the terms of the 2017 Plan, achievement of 100% of the target rate results in the payment of 100% of individual target awards. For NEOs, achievement of the minimum of the performance range results in the payment of 62.5% of individual target awards and achievement of the maximum results in the payment of 250% of individual target awards, in each case subject to a discretionary downward adjustment by the Committee of up to 100%. No awards are payable if performance falls below the threshold level.    2018 AIP Metrics and Results Metric     Threshold Target Maximum Actual Results Payout Achieved Weighting Result TRIR 0.37 0.26 0.00 0.40 0.00% 7.50% 0.00% Spill Rate 0.17 0.11 0.00 0.60 181.82% 7.50% 13.46% LOE/BOE $9.18 $8.80 $7.91 $8.95 102.68% 20.00% 20.54% Reserves Replacement 85.00% 100.00% 140.00% 166.00% 250.00% 20.00% 50.00% Production Target (BOEPD) 161,500 170,000 178,500 167,792 108.76% 20.00% 21.75% EBITDA/Average Capital Employed 17.00% 19.00% 21.00% 19.90% 181.25% 25.00% 45.31% Total 151.24% The Committee exercised its negative discretion in adjusting annual cash payments under the AIP for NEOs for 2018 bonuses, which were payable in the first quarter of 2019. These downward adjustments included an across-the-board cut by 8% to 20% for all earned awards to the NEOs bringing NEO payouts to a level commensurate with those of other plan participants, even though the Company met or exceeded three of the six 2018 operational, safety and strategic performance goals. Mr. Looney and Mr. Coleman received a smaller reduction than other NEOs based on the feedback of the CEO as to their performance during 2018.

30 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION C. Long-term Incentive Compensation The objectives of the Company's long-term incentive program are: 1 to align executives' interests with the interests of stockholders; 2 to reinforce the critical objective of building stockholder value over the long term; 3 to assist in the long-term attraction, motivation, and retention of an outstanding management team; 4 to complement the short-term performance metrics of the 2017 Plan; and 5 to focus management attention upon the execution of the long-term business strategy of the Company. The Company generally targets the median of competitive market pay levels for the annual grant value of long-term incentive compensation. When determining the size of the equity-based awards to the executives and the total number of shares available for equity-based award grants for all management employees for the fiscal year, the Committee considers survey data provided by the Committee's compensation consultant, overall Company performance, internal equity, and individual performance, as well as the proportion of the total shares outstanding used for annual equity-based award grants and the potential dilution to the Company's stockholders. During the first quarter of 2018, the Committee awarded long-term incentive grants to NEOs pursuant to the 2012 Long-term Incentive Plan (the '2012 LTI Plan") equal to approximately 100% of the target award opportunities for each NEO based upon the 50th percentile competitive market practice. This also represented a return to the Company's target market positioning for long-term incentive awards after grants in 2017 were made below the 50th percentile based on the Committee's view of appropriate grant levels at that time. Long-term incentive compensation for 2018 included the grant of RSUs and PSUs under the Company's 2012 LTI Plan and the Company's 2018 LTI Plan, which replaced the 2012 LTI Plan after the 2018 LTI Plan's approval at the 2018 Annual Meeting. Long-term incentive grants for each NEO were awarded 75% in the value of PSUs and 25% in the value of RSUs. In light of a shift in the peer group compensation practices and due to provisions contained within the 2012 LTI Plan, the Committee ceased the inclusion of stock options as a part of the 2018 long-term incentive compensation mix. To maintain parity with the other operational EVPs, Mr. McFadyen's 2018 long-term incentive grants equaled approximately 162% of his U.S. dollar long-term incentive target guideline due to his performance and the exchange rate disparity between the U.S. and Canadian dollar. Mr. Coleman's 2018 long-term incentive grants equaled approximately 130% of his U.S. dollar long-term incentive target guideline due to his performance. These guidelines, provided by Pay Governance from the Mercer Human Resource Consulting Energy 27 survey, were constructed around the 50th percentile competitive data. Total grants to all long-term incentive participants made in 2018 equaled approximately 0.95% of the Company's outstanding shares which is below the 1% annual maximum grant allowed under the 2012 LTI Plan and 2018 LTI Plan. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 31 NEO grants were as follows:    Named Executive Officer Number of Time-Based Restricted Stock Units 1,2 Number of Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units1,2 Roger W.

This award was granted on February 6, 2018 and is scheduled to vest on the fifth anniversary of the award's grant date.    TIME-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS RSUs awarded in 2018 generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date. Dividend equivalents are accumulated during the performance period and pay out only if the underlying units vest and are earned. Holders of RSUs do not have any voting rights. PERFORMANCE-BASED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TSR as a Performance Metric The Committee believes that a performance unit program based on TSR relative to peer companies aligns pay and Company performance. The industry peers selected for each performance cycle generally match the industry peers comprising the prevailing peer group used for compensation benchmarking. TSR is determined by calculating the stock price appreciation, or reduction per share, for the performance period assuming dividends are reinvested on a monthly basis. For purposes of this calculation, the beginning and ending stock prices are the averages of the closing stock prices for the month immediately preceding and the last month of the performance period. Notwithstanding the satisfaction of any performance goals, the number of shares granted, issued, retainable and/or vested under an award of PSUs on account of either financial performance or personal performance evaluations may, to the extent specified in the Agreement, be reduced by the Committee on the basis of such further considerations as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. Payout / Performance Leverage PSUs awarded in 2018 will be eligible to vest in three years based on how the Company's TSR compares to the TSR of an index of the comparator group of energy companies (identified above). The 2018 performance unit awards contain four equally weighted measurement periods: year 1; year 2; year 3; and years 1-3 combined. Achievement of the 50th percentile TSR of the TSR peer group is required for vesting and payment of 100% of the target PSUs awarded, achievement of the 90th percentile TSR of the TSR peer group is required for vesting and payment of 150% of the target PSUs awarded, and achievement of the 25th percentile TSR of the TSR peer group is required for the vesting and payment of 50% of the target PSUs awarded. A prorated percentage of PSUs can vest and be paid for performance between the 25th and 90th TSR percentiles. No payment is made for achievement below the 25th percentile TSR of the TSR peer group. Dividend equivalents are accumulated during the performance period and pay out only to the extent that the underlying units vest and are earned. Holders of PSUs do not have any voting rights. 
32 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION FORM OF COMPENSATION SELECTION AND PLAN INFORMATION As noted above, the Committee currently uses two principal forms of long-term incentive compensation: RSUs and PSUs. While the Committee expects to continue to use these two principal forms of equity-based incentives going forward, it is possible that the Committee may adopt a different long-term incentive compensation strategy in future years in response to changes in the competitive marketplace, regulatory actions, and/or changes to business strategy. In order to provide for flexibility going forward, the 2018 LTI Plan provides possible alternative long-term equity incentive awards in addition to time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, phantom units, dividend equivalents, and other stock-based incentives. The 2018 LTI Plan includes a list of other performance criteria that could be used for determination of performance-based awards. During 2018, the Company granted 1,641,500 shares as Full Value Awards under the 2012 LTI Plan and 10,000 as Full Value Awards under the 2018 LTI Plan (as defined in the applicable plan). As of December 31, 2018, the number of shares available for future grants of Full Value Awards under the 2018 LTI Plan was 3,365,000. No further awards will be granted under the 2012 LTI Plan.

34 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION D. Employee Benefits and Perquisites The objectives of the Company's employee benefits and perquisites program are: 1 to provide an employee benefit package with the same level of benefits provided to all Company employees which is competitive within the Company's industry sector; 2 to offer executives indirect compensation which is efficient and supplemental to their direct compensation to assist with retirement, health, and welfare needs for individuals and their families; and 3 to provide only limited benefits to selected executives as deemed appropriate under the circumstances. The Company's executives are provided usual and customary employee benefits available to all employees. These include thrift savings (401(k)), life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, medical/dental insurance, vision insurance, long-term disability insurance, and a Company-sponsored pension plan. Effective with the spin-off of Murphy's former U.S. retail marketing operation, Murphy USA Inc. (MUSA) on August 30, 2013, significant modifications were made to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. Certain Company employees' benefits under the U.S. plan were frozen at that time. No further benefit service will accrue for the affected employees; however, the plan will recognize future earnings after the spin-off. In addition, all previously unvested benefits became fully vested at the spin-off date. For those affected active employees of the Company, additional U.S. retirement plan benefits will accrue in future periods under a cash balance formula. Tax regulations adversely affect certain highly compensated employees by restricting their full participation in qualified pension and defined contribution (thrift) plans. In an effort to provide the same level of retirement benefit opportunity for all employees, the Company maintains a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"). The purpose of the SERP is to restore pension plan and thrift plan benefits which are not payable under such plans because of certain specified benefit and compensation limitations under tax regulations. The benefit to the Company of this arrangement is the retention and long-term service of employees who are otherwise unprotected by employment contracts. The SERP is unfunded and is subject to general credit of the Company. Other than the SERP, the Company does not offer a deferred compensation alternative to the NEOs. The Committee also provides to Mr. Jenkins a maximum of 50 flight hours each year in the continental United States on Company aircraft as part of his total compensation package. Mr. Jenkins' aggregate incremental cost to the Company of $173,615 as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. The Standard Industry Fare Level rate was used to determine the income reportable to Mr. Jenkins for these trips, and the Company has not provided any tax gross-up or other tax assistance with respect to the income recognized for use of the Company aircraft. 
Actions Related to 2019 Compensation At its meeting on February 4, 2019, the Committee discussed executive compensation issues reflecting the Company's 2018 performance results and executive pay matters for fiscal year 2019. The Committee reviewed and analyzed the Murphy executive compensation program as well as considered the past year's performance and proper positioning of compensation opportunities for fiscal year 2019. Key decisions and actions related to 2019 executive compensation reached by the Committee are included below: Actions Taken During 2019 to Enhance the Executive Compensation Program Performance Share Unit Awards ("PSUs") – Measurement Period The Committee recognizes that stockholders may be more focused on demonstrated longer-term performance cycles. At its February meeting, the Committee approved that TSR metrics be based solely on a 36-month measurement period, rather than including three one-year measurement periods, pursuant to the Company's 2018 LTI Plan. PSUs – Vesting Cap for Negative Absolute TSR To further align the payouts our executives receive with the Company's TSR, the Committee reviewed the relative TSR performance terms for the PSU awards at its February meeting. After review, the Committee approved new terms beginning with the 2019 PSU awards. If the TSR at the end of the performance period is negative, the new terms will prohibit vesting above the target level of performance and the payout percentage will be capped at 100% regardless of ranking. Adoption of Change in Control Double Trigger Vesting for Long-Term Incentives Beginning in February 2019, any long-term incentive awards granted to the CEO, to direct reports of the CEO and to any Named Executive Officer will require two defined triggers upon a Company CIC event: (i) the Company experiences a CIC (as defined and set forth in various long-term incentive documents); and (ii) the CEO, a direct report of the CEO and any Named Executive Officer experiences an involuntary termination of employment or terminates employment for stated good reason. Adoption of a Single Peer Group Beginning 2019, the Committee adopted a new 17 company peer group effective with the 2019 performance year and years thereafter which will be used for both compensation and performance benchmarking as well as the relative TSR performance ranking process for long-term PSU grants. This single peer group is comprised of both peer companies that are engaged in offshore, international exploration and production as well as peer companies engaged in onshore, multi-play shale exploration and production in the U.S. Severance Protection Plan for Selected Officers in Event of Company CIC Seven officers, in addition to the CEO, were extended severance compensation protection in the event that they were terminated involuntarily or elected to terminate for stated good reason within two years following a Company CIC transaction. Such prospective compensation, payable only in the event of a CIC and termination of employment, has been benchmarked to the 50th percentile of industry severance compensation practices. 2019 PROXY STATEMENT 35 
36 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION Compensation Policies and Processes The Committee oversees and approves the compensation of the NEOs. The Committee currently consists of four members, all of whom have been determined by the Board to satisfy the heightened independence requirements of the NYSE and the Company's categorical independence standards. The Nominating & Governance Committee recommends nominees for appointment to the Committee annually and as vacancies or newly created positions occur. Committee members are appointed and approved by the Board and may be removed by the Board at any time. Members of the Committee during 2018 were Neal E. Schmale (Chair), T. Jay Collins, Walentin Mirosh and Jeffrey W. Nolan. The Committee reviews and approves corporate goals and objectives relevant to the CEO's and other NEO's compensation and evaluates the CEO's performance in light of these goals and objectives. Any decisions regarding the CEO's compensation are made solely by the Committee based on that evaluation. For NEOs other than the CEO, the Committee considers the performance evaluations made by the CEO and the recommendations of the CEO. The Committee administers and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the Company's incentive and equity-based compensation plans, and it reviews and approves awards granted under such plans. Role of Independent Compensation Advisory Firm As set forth in its charter, which can be found on the Company's website http://ir.murphyoilcorp.com/phoenix. zhtml?c=61237&p=irol-govHighlights, the Committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultant to be used to assist in the evaluation of director, CEO or senior executive compensation and has the sole authority to approve the consultant's fees and other retention terms. Advice and assistance from internal or external legal, accounting or other advisors is also available to the Committee. Pay Governance provides the Committee with, among other things, an analysis of trends and compensation data for general industry, the oil and natural gas industry and a select group of comparator companies within the oil and natural gas industry. In 2018, the Committee again retained Pay Governance as an independent compensation consultant. All Pay Governance invoices were approved by the Committee's Chair prior to payment. In its role as an advisor to the Committee, Pay Governance attended all three Committee meetings in 2018 and provided the Committee with objective and expert analyses, independent advice and information with respect to executive and director compensation. Pay Governance does not provide any other consulting services to the Committee or to the Company, other than those dealing with executive compensation and the compensation of non-employee directors. The Committee annually evaluates the performance and independence of Pay Governance. In 2018, Pay Governance delivered a letter to the Committee that provided full disclosure relating to Pay Governance's relationship to the Company, taking into account the SEC's Consultant Independence Factors and Pay Governance's Independence Policy. The Committee has determined that there are no business or personal relationships between Pay Governance and the members of the Committee or the Company's executive officers that may create a conflict of interest impairing Pay Governance's ability to provide independent objective advice to the Committee. 2018 Peer Group Determination The Committee annually engages Pay Governance to determine appropriate comparator companies for purposes of peer compensation analysis. In 2014, Pay Governance recommended a bifurcated approach resulting in the selection of one group for general compensation comparisons and a larger second group for the TSR calculation. In 2015, Pay Governance recognized the Company's mix of onshore, offshore, domestic and international operations and selected a group of companies with business and labor rationales similar to those of the Company for compensation benchmarking. Pay Governance further noted that the relatively small number of companies in that group, coupled with a wide divergence in market capitalization, could lead to distortions in the calculation of relative TSR and recommended that a larger group of companies be utilized for this purpose. In 2018, Pay Governance reaffirmed this bifurcated approach and the Committee approved the use of two separate peer groups in designing the compensation programs for the Company: the compensation peer group and the TSR peer group. 
The table below sets forth the 2018 peer groups:    Anadarko Petroleum Corporation     Encana Corporation Pioneer Natural Resources Corporation Apache Corporation EOG Resources, Inc. Range Resources Corporation Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation Hess Corporation Southwestern Energy Corporation Chesapeake Energy Corporation Marathon Oil Corporation Whiting Petroleum Corporation Cimarex Energy Co. Newfield Exploration Company Devon Energy Corporation Noble Energy, Inc. 2018 Compensation Peer 2018 TSR Peer For 2019, Pay Governance revisited the bifurcated approach at the request of the Committee to determine if a single peer group would be best suited for purposes of compensation benchmarking as well as TSR relative ranking with respect to prospective new grants of performance-based long-term incentives. The peer group company search criteria included: Market capitalization of Murphy ranking at least at the 25th to 30th percentile of the potential new peers; and    In order to balance out market capitalization with complexity and breadth, the following variables were also considered: Offshore, deep-water companies; Onshore companies; Exploration and production companies with multiple onshore plays; and International operations.    The Committee found that the difference between the two peer groups used by Murphy presented a significant difference in the scope and size of companies included in both. For example, the 10-company peer group used for compensation benchmarking included larger E & P companies that were predominately involved in international deep-water exploration. Murphy's market capitalization compared to those 10 companies was well below the 25th percentile of that group, even though Murphy directly competes with those companies for management talent. The TSR performance benchmarking peer group included many more on-shore companies, some of which were well below the Murphy market capitalization size criteria. As a result, the Committee worked closely with its executive compensation group to select a single peer group that would directly address the disparate market capitalization issues found in both sets of peers by selecting a single peer group that would better fit the parameters of Murphy's size, scope of operations, and source of management talent. Following this analysis, Pay Governance recommended the adoption of, and the Committee approved, a new single peer group that includes a group of comparable companies to be used for both the Company's 2019 Compensation and TSR peer group. The recommendation included the elimination of EOG Resources, Inc. and Pioneer Natural Resources due to their large size as measured by market capitalization, the addition of three onshore multiple play companies: Matador Resources, SM Energy Company, and CNX Resources Corporation, and the retention of Newfield Exploration for the near term until its acquisition by Encana Corporation is approved and the transaction is closed.2019 PROXY STATEMENT 37 
The table below illustrates the changes to the Company's peer group for 2019: - Peers Removed (2) = 2019 Peer Group (17 Total Companies) EOG Resources, Inc.

CNX Resources Corporation CNX Resources Corporation Matador Resources Company Devon Energy Corporation SM Energy Company Encana Corporation Hess Corporation Marathon Oil Corporation Matador Resources Company Newfield Exploration Company Noble Energy, Inc. Range Resources Corporation SM Energy Company Southwestern Energy Corporation Whiting Petroleum Corporation In addition to comparator company information, the Committee uses Mercer Human Resource Consulting Energy 27 survey information to determine competitive market pay levels for the NEOs. The Committee also reviews a special analysis of the competitive pay levels of the Company's compensation peer group in establishing pay levels for the CEO and NEOs. The Committee generally takes action on compensation matters, including the grant of long-term incentive awards, at its meeting held in conjunction with the February Board meeting. At this meeting the Committee also considers adjustments to NEO base salary, annual incentive bonus opportunities and grants of long-term incentive awards. The Committee also meets at other times during the year as necessary and, in 2018, met three times.    38    MURPHY OIL CORPORATION     
Guiding Principles The Committee bases its executive compensation decisions on principles designed to align the interests of executives with those of stockholders. The Committee intends compensation to provide a direct link with the Company's objectives, business strategies and financial results. In order to motivate, attract and retain key executives who are critical to its long-term success, the Company believes that its pay package should be competitive with others in the oil and natural gas industry. In addition, the Company believes that executives should be rewarded for both the short-term and long-term success of the Company and, conversely, be subject to a degree of downside risk in the event that the Company does not achieve its performance objectives. In order to promote the long-term, as well as short-term interests of the Company, and to more closely align the interests of its key employees to those of its stockholders, the Company uses a mix of short-term and long-term incentives in its compensation packages. Individuals in primary positions to influence the growth of stockholder wealth have larger portions of their total compensation delivered in the form of equity-based long-term incentives. To this end, executives have a compensation package which includes a base salary, participation in a cash-based annual incentive plan, participation in an equity-based long-term incentive plan and certain other compensation, including customary benefits as discussed in Section D of Elements of Compensation in this CD&A. In addition, the compensation package for the CEO includes limited personal use of Company aircraft. The Company believes that this combination of base salary, short-term incentives, long-term incentives and employee benefits provides the best balance between the need for the Company to provide executive compensation which is competitive in the marketplace and therefore necessary for recruiting and retention, and the desire to have management's interests, motivations and prosperity aligned with the interests of the Company's stockholders. At the Company's Annual Meeting of stockholders on May 9, 2018, the Company's stockholders had the opportunity to cast an advisory vote (a "say-on-pay" proposal) to approve the compensation of the CEO and NEOs, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement, for the meeting. Stockholders approved the say-on-pay proposal by the affirmative vote of over 92% in 2018, consistent with the highly favorable vote outcomes by stockholders since the onset of the say-on-pay voting requirement. The Committee is cognizant of the advisory vote results of say-on-pay and will communicate directly with investors/stockholders as required to address their concerns. Risk Evaluation In order to monitor the risk associated with executive compensation, in October 2018, the Committee reviewed a report from Pay Governance assessing the risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices. The Committee agreed with the report's findings that these risks were within the Committee's ability to effectively monitor and manage and the programs do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Tax Policy Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, generally limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid to certain NEOs to $1 million annually. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, Section 162(m) provided an exception from this limitation for "qualified performance-based compensation," and the Committee considered the impact of the tax deductibility limitation when making compensation decisions and certain elements of the Company's incentive compensation program were structured to meet this exception. The TCJA repealed the "qualified performance-based compensation" exception, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The TCJA provides transition relief for certain contractual arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017, if certain requirements are met. The Committee has and will continue to retain the flexibility to design and maintain the executive compensation programs in a manner that is most beneficial to stockholders, including the payment of compensation that is subject to the deduction limits under Section 162(m). 2019 PROXY STATEMENT 39

Performance-based restricted stock unit awards are subject to performance-based conditions and are forfeited if the grantee's employment terminates for any reason other than retirement, death or full disability. The performance-based restricted stock unit awards vest three years from the date of grant if performance conditions are met. Time-based restricted stock unit awards vest three years from the date of grant and are forfeited if the grantee's employment terminates for any reason other than retirement, death or full disability. There is no assurance that the value realized by the executive will be at or near the value included herein. 2 Reflects payments under our annual incentive program awarded and paid after the end of the year in which they are reported. Because these payments related to services rendered in the year prior to payment, the Company reported these incentives as a component of compensation expense in the year for which the award was earned. 2019 PROXY STATEMENT 41 
3 The amounts shown in this column reflect the annual change in accumulated benefits under the Murphy Oil Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. See the 2018 Pension Benefits Table below for more information. There are no deferred compensation earnings reported in this column, as the Company's non-qualified deferred compensation plans do not provide above-market or preferential earnings. See the 2018 Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Table below for more information. Where the annual change in accumulated benefits was negative, it was excluded from this column and from the Summary Compensation Table Total column. The annual change in accumulated benefits were negative for 2018 for Mr. Jenkins (-$91,797) and Mr. Compton (-$219,082). 4 The total amounts shown in this column for 2018 consist of the following: Mr. Jenkins $79,788 - Company contributions to defined contribution plans; $810 - benefit attributable to Company-provided term life insurance policy; $173,615 - Company airplane usage based on aggregate incremental cost to the Company. The aggregate incremental cost to the Company for airplane usage is calculated by multiplying, for each trip, the statutory miles for each trip times the 12-month average direct cost per statutory mile for the airplane used. The direct costs utilized in the calculation include: travel expenses for the aviation crew, communications expenses, landing fees, fuel and lubrication, contract maintenance and repairs, and the provision allocated for the overhaul of the engines. Mr. Looney: $30,875 - Company contributions to defined contribution plans; $810 - Benefit attributable to Company-provided term life insurance policy; $247,945 - Benefit attributable to Company relocation allowances. Mr. Eckart: $15,579 - Company contributions to defined contribution plans; $338 - Benefit attributable to Company-provided term life insurance policy Mr. Coleman: $35,355 - Company contributions to defined contribution plans; $810 - Benefit attributable to Company-provided term life insurance policy. Mr. McFadyen: $11,000 - Company contributions to defined contribution plans; $931 - Benefit attributable to Company-provided term life insurance policy; $58,320 - Benefit attributable to Company relocation allowances. Mr. Compton: $34,966 - Company contributions to defined contribution plans; $810 - Benefit attributable to Company-provided term life insurance policy. 5 Mr. Looney was appointed as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and became a NEO, on March 1, 2018. 6 Mr. Eckart relinquished his title as Chief Financial Officer on February 28, 2018 and retired from the Company effective May 31, 2018. 7 Mr. McFadyen's Canadian based salary earnings were converted to US$473,476 using a currency conversion factor of 0.7333 Canadian dollars to U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2018. Pay Ratio In accordance with the requirements of Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (which we collectively refer to as the "Pay Ratio Rule"), we are providing the following estimated information for 2018: the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (except our Chief Executive Officer) was $140,965; the annual total compensation of Chief Executive officer was $13,370,132; and the ratio of these two amounts was 95 to 1. We believe that this ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Pay Ratio Rule.    SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and assumptions and, as result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFYING OUR "MEDIAN EMPLOYEE" Employee Population To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our Chief Executive Officer), we first identified our total employee population from which we determined our "median employee". We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 1,300 individuals. To identify our "median employee" from our total employee population, we compared the amount of total taxable earnings reflected in each country's payroll records, converted to U.S. dollars. We identified our "median employee" using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in the calculation. 42 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 43 DETERMINATION OF ANNUAL TOTAL COMPENSATION OF OUR "MEDIAN EMPLOYEE" AND OUR CEO Once we identified our "median employee", we then calculated such employee's annual total compensation for 2018 using the same methodology we used for purposes of determining the annual total compensation of our NEOs for 2018 (as set forth in the above 2018 Summary Compensation Table). Our CEO's annual total compensation for 2018 for purposes of the Pay Ratio Rule is equal to the amount reported in the "Total" column in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, adjusted, to the extent applicable, in a similar manner as the annual total compensation of our "median employee". 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Award Table Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards1     Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards2 Name Grant Date Threshold ($) Target ($) Maximum ($) Threshold (#) Target (#) Maximum (#) All Other Stock Awards: Number of Shares of Stock or Units3 (#) Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards4 ($) Roger W.

Actual payouts for 2018 are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table above. 2 Threshold and maximum awards are based on the provisions of the applicable PSU award agreements. Actual PSU awards earned can range from 0 to 150% of the target awards. 3 Amounts include time-based RSUs, which generally cliff-vest three years after their grant date. 4 The grant date value for the RSUs is computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, excluding forfeiture estimates, as more fully described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2018 Form 10-K report. The grant date fair value of the Company's performance-based restricted stock units is determined using a Monte-Carlo valuation model, as further described in Note K to the consolidated financial statements included in the Form 10-K report.

Compton Retirement Plan of Murphy Oil Corporation 31.000 1,349,680 — Murphy Oil Corporation Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 31.000 3,956,748 — The purpose of the Retirement Plan of Murphy Oil Corporation, a tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan, is to provide retirement and incidental benefits for all employees who complete a period of faithful service. The purpose of the SERP is to restore defined benefit and defined contribution benefits which cannot be paid because of certain specified benefit and compensation limitations under the tax-qualified retirement plan. The pension formula used to calculate benefits is: 1.6% times final average pay (FAP) times years of benefit service minus 1.5% times primary social security benefit times years of benefit service (to a maximum of 33 1/3 years). The FAP used in calculating benefits under the plans is the average cash compensation (salary and annual incentive bonus) over the highest paid 36-month period during the employee's last ten years of employment. Distribution elections for the qualified plan are made upon retirement. Benefits shown are computed on a single life annuity basis and are subject to a deduction for social security amounts. The pension benefits shown neither reflect any reductions in retirement benefits that would result from the selection of one of the plan's various available survivorship options nor the actuarial reductions required by the plan for retirement earlier than age 62. For this purpose, Mr. Jenkins' average compensation was $3,095,914; Mr. Eckart's $1,020,033; Mr. Coleman's $1,043,287; Mr. McFadyen's $1,673,481 (Under the retirement plan for Murphy Oil Company Ltd., the average final pay of C$1,111,500 was converted to US$815,063 using a currency conversion factor of 0.7333 Canadian dollars to U.S. dollar) and Mr. Compton's $989,747. The estimated credited years of service used are as indicated in the table. Effective with the spin-off of MUSA on August 30, 2013, significant modifications were made to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. All current NEOs continue to accrue benefits in this plan, however, certain Murphy employees' benefits under the U.S. plan were frozen at that time. No further benefit service will accrue for the affected employees; however, the plan will recognize future earnings after the spin-off. In addition, all previously unvested benefits became fully vested at the spin-off date. For those affected active employees of the Company, additional U.S. retirement plan benefits will accrue in future periods under a cash balance formula. The following assumptions were used in determining the present value amounts at December 31, 2018. Discount Rate—4.38% Mortality Table—MRP-2006 (RP-2014 no-collar annuitant table backed off to 2006 using scale MP-2014 and projected generational mortality improvements based on the MMP-2018 scale).

The "Aggregate Earnings" column reflects the different investment returns based upon the Named Executive Officer's investment selection. The purpose of the Thrift Plan for Employees of Murphy Oil Corporation, a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan, is to provide retirement and incidental benefits for all employees who participate in the Plan. The purpose of the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) is to restore defined benefit and defined contribution benefits which cannot be invested because of certain specified benefit and compensation limitations under the tax-qualified Thrift/401(k) Plan. The employees are immediately vested in all employee and Company matching contributions. The Company matching contributions are limited to dollar for dollar on the first 6%. All employees are allowed to contribute on a pre-tax basis up to 25% of their eligible pay. The table above represents amounts deferred under the SERP for 2018. 2018 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control Table In connection with his appointment to President and CEO in 2013, Mr. Jenkins entered into a Severance Protection Agreement which provides for the payment of severance benefits in a lump sum equal to three times the sum of Mr. Jenkins' base salary and his average annual bonus over the prior three fiscal years. The Agreement also contains customary restrictive covenants applicable during the twelve-month period following termination under the Agreement. During 2018, the Company had no other employment, change in control or termination agreements with its NEOs. However, upon a change in control, as defined in the applicable plan under which the award was granted, all outstanding equity awards granted under such plans will vest, become immediately exercisable or payable or have all restrictions lifted which apply to the type of award. During 2018, the Company had no other agreement, contract, plan, or arrangement, whether written or unwritten, that provided for potential payments to NEOs upon termination or a change in control. NEOs are specifically excluded from normal severance benefits offered to other employees; however, the Company has, from time-to-time, paid termination benefits to executive-level positions upon an end in service. Decisions by the Company whether to pay termination benefits, and, if so, in what amounts, are determined on a case-by-case basis. As noted in the accompanying CD&A, the Company has made substantive changes to its policies and practices regarding CIC severance compensation which will become effective for the first time in 2019, including the new grants of long-term incentives which occurred in early 2019. The new policy impacting the CEO and seven executive officers reporting directly to the CEO, including the NEOs, is that the 2019 long-term incentive grants now require a double-trigger before accelerated vesting occurs: (i) a CIC transaction; and (ii) an involuntary termination of the executive's employment or a termination by the executive for good reason. In addition, the Company has provided competitive cash severance compensation should the CEO or NEOs be terminated pursuant to a CIC or terminate employment for good reason upon a CIC event. Please see pages 30 of the proxy CD&A for a full description of these changes which became effective in 2019.

No such waivers were granted or applied for in 2018. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that all directors recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal, business or professional interests. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 53 Audit Committee Report In connection with the Company's December 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the specific disclosures contained in the Company's Form 10-K, including "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and independence standards, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with KPMG LLP's independence.

54 MURPHY OIL CORPORATION PROPOSAL 3 Approval of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 55 PROPOSAL 3 The Board desires that the stockholders indicate their approval or disapproval of the Audit Committee's action in appointing KPMG LLP the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year 2019. KPMG LLP has been serving the Company and its subsidiaries in this role for many years. KPMG LLP has advised the Company that its members have no direct or indirect financial interest in the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Members of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the purpose of responding to inquiries by stockholders, and such representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of KPMG to serve as our independent auditors is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is also responsible for the audit fee negotiations with KPMG LLP and pre-approves any engagement of KPMG LLP. Under Murphy's policy for pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services by KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee has delegated the right to pre-approve services between meeting dates to one or more members of the Audit Committee, provided that decisions of such members to grant pre-approvals is presented at the next scheduled meeting of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee evaluates all services, including those engagements related to tax and internal control over financial reporting, considering the nature of such services in light of auditor independence, in accordance with the rules of the PCAOB. In the fiscal year 2018, the percentage of services designated for audit fees, audit-related fees, tax fees, and all other fees that were approved by the Audit Committee were 96%, 2%, 2%, and 0%, respectively. Our Audit Committee will consider the outcome of this vote in its decision to appoint an independent registered public accounting firm, but it is not bound by the stockholders' vote. Even if the selection of KPMG LLP is ratified, the Audit Committee may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
