ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The nominees for director for a three-year term will be elected provided that they receive the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. This means that, if a quorum is present, the three persons receiving the greatest numbers of votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected to serve as directors. Withholding authority to vote for a director nominee will not affect the outcome of the election of directors. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors.

Deloitte & Touche LLP will be ratified as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, provided the proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon.

Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, will have the effect of votes against the proposed resolution. A broker non-vote is treated as not being entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, is not counted for purposes of determining whether the proposal has been approved. 
2019 PROXY SUMMARY 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Commitment to Board Refreshment. In May 2018, Kathleen M. Shanahan and Ronald R. Steger joined the Board as Independent Directors. More than half of our directors have joined the Board in 2016 or later. 
Stockholder Engagement Efforts. The Board views stockholder outreach as an area of priority and in fiscal 2018 oversaw the enhancement of the Company's engagement program, including outreach to over 50% of the stockholders and a specific focus on corporate governance and executive compensation. 
Strong Independent Board. The Board understands that maintaining qualified independent and non-management directors on the Board is an integral part of effective corporate governance. The Board believes its current, refreshed leadership strikes an appropriate balance between independent directors and directors affiliated with the Company. This allows the Board to effectively represent the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Continually Updating Key Governance Policies. Annually, our Board reviews the charter of each of its standing committees. During 2018, our Board amended the Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charters to promote corporate governance best practices and adopted the Audit Committee charter without any changes. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES     
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ◾   Standing Board Committees Comprised Solely of Independent  Directors    ◾   Executive Sessions of Independent Directors Held at All  Regularly Scheduled Board Meetings 
 ◾   Risk Oversight by the Board and Committees    ◾   Oversight of CEO Succession Planning Process 
 ◾   Comprehensive Code of Business Conduct & Ethics with  Annual Director and Employee Certification of Compliance    ◾   Robust Foreign Corrupt Practices Act Compliance Program for All  Employees Responsible for or in support of Foreign Operations & Purchasing 
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
As illustrated in the following charts and consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, the majority of our named executive officers' target total compensation for 2018 (i.e. the sum of annualized base salary, target STI award and target LTI awards, excluding performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Special Incentive Program described below) is performance based or "at-risk," meaning it is only earned if specific financial goals are achieved. 
In addition to the regular compensation program, upon recommendation by the CEO, the Compensation Committee awarded an equity-based Special Incentive Program to senior personnel that was designed to incentivize extraordinary performance. The Special Incentive Program may be earned based upon performance metrics that were significantly higher than the regular performance-based program and further includes a time-vesting component for any earned equity. The goal of the Compensation Committee was to incentivize senior personnel to achieve and exceed the Company's strategic goals and to further link the interests of Company leaders with those of the shareholders. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PRACTICES 
Our executive compensation program is designed to support our financial and strategic goals, align executive pay with stockholder value creation, and discourage unnecessary and excessive risk-taking. Our Compensation Committee regularly reviews our executive compensation program to incorporate commonly viewed best practices as it deems appropriate, examples of which include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓    regular risk assessment of executive compensation programs    ✓    no tax gross-ups for excess parachute  payments 
 ✓    all senior executives have stock retention requirements    ✓    a compensation recoupment (clawback) policy 
 ✓    annual incentive compensation and long-term compensation are based on a variety of performance  metrics    ✓    senior executives are discouraged from hedging or pledging Company  securities 
 ✓    executive compensation is variable and linked to meeting financial and strategic goals and stock price  performance    ✓    The Compensation Committee engages an independent compensation consultant

2018 STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH 
SAY-ON-PAY VOTE AND SUBSEQUENT INVESTOR OUTREACH 
Overview 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our advisory proposal to approve our executive compensation program received majority support from our stockholders, but at a significantly lower level than in prior years. While we believe that our existing executive compensation program properly encourages and rewards the achievement of financial results that promote long-term stockholder value creation, we were disappointed by the decline in support from prior years and took steps to develop a better understanding of the perspectives of our stockholders with respect to our executive compensation practices and to evaluate any concerns or constructive feedback we received. This specifically targeted stockholder engagement was done to supplement our ongoing investor relations program and is described in more detail below. 
Outreach Team 
The participants of the Company's stockholder outreach team consisted of our Compensation Committee Chair, our Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary, our Vice President of Human Resources, and our Manager of Investor Relations. The Compensation Committee members, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer reviewed summaries of the feedback received during the process, and the full Board of Directors received regular updates from the Compensation Committee throughout the process.

Extent of Outreach 
During our outreach campaign, we invited 12 of our top 25 stockholders, representing over 50% of our outstanding shares, to discuss their views and proxy voting guidelines with respect to our executive compensation program and disclosures. As a result, we held discussions with institutional stockholders that represented approximately 31.5% of our shares outstanding. Topics discussed with stockholders included our executive compensation program for 2017, changes made to the 2018 compensation program, pay-for-performance strategy, performance-based vesting criteria and metrics for our short-term and long-term incentive programs, and our executive compensation disclosures, as well as board refreshment and other corporate governance practices. The Company and the Compensation Committee intend to continue to expand this outreach campaign by increasing the frequency of outreach efforts in order to facilitate stockholder input into the Company's executive compensation philosophy. 
What We Heard 
Though there was no strong consensus on any one particular item, some of the feedback we received was echoed by two or more other investors. Below is an overview of the stockholder feedback we received:

What We Did and Why 
The Company and the Compensation Committee considered the results of the "say-on-pay" voting and the feedback from the stockholder engagement process in assessing whether there was a need for modifications or enhancements to our executive compensation program and other governance issues. The Compensation Committee took the following actions in 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                          Enhanced Disclosure on Compensation Matters   Given that nearly all of the stockholders we spoke to expressed the desire for enhanced  disclosure regarding our executive compensation practices, we re-designed the proxy statement and especially our Compensation Discussion and Analysis to provide more detail regarding the specific factors that  influence the Compensation Committee's decisions, along with greater clarity on our executive compensation program as a whole, to the extent possible. For example, the Company added disclosures in both the descriptions of the Annual Incentive  Compensation and the Long-Term Incentive Awards sections regarding the reasons that specific quantitative and qualitative metrics were chosen for evaluation of performance-based compensation and also added more information regarding how the  Company's peer group is selected.

                          Enhanced Disclosure Regarding Directors   Given the feedback from some of our major shareholders regarding refreshment of the Board and disclosure regarding qualifications and skills of our directors,  we added a section summarizing the skills and qualifications of our Board as a whole. This summary lists the measures that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has determined are important and the number of directors currently on the  Board that have those skills and qualifications. We also added a disclosure in our 2019 Proxy Summary showing average tenure and average age of our directors.

                          Continuation of Basic Plan Structure   Over the last few years, the Company has changed the performance metrics for our long-term incentive program from year-to-year. Our stockholders generally expressed a desire for continuity of performance metrics from year-to-year, a practice  that the Compensation Committee believes is appropriate for the 2019 compensation plan as we continue to execute on our strategic plan. As our strategic plan develops, the Compensation Committee agrees with stockholders that adaptation of the  program may be necessary to motivate new business needs.

LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
The Board is led by an independent Board Chair. Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, the Board is permitted to either separate or combine the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair as it deems appropriate from time to time. We currently separate the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair in recognition of the differences between the two roles as they are presently defined. At present, the Board believes that separation of the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Board Chair improves the ability of the Board to exercise its oversight role over management, provides multiple opportunities for discussion and evaluation of management decisions and the direction of the Company, and ensures a significant role for the Board's non-management directors in the oversight and leadership of the Company. 
The Board understands that maintaining qualified independent and non-management directors on the Board is an integral part of effective corporate governance. In the last eighteen months, the Company took active steps to refresh the Board with highly qualified and experienced directors by adding two new independent directors, Ms. Shanahan and Mr. Steger, effective as of the 2018 Annual Meeting. There are presently seven directors who are independent within the meaning of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules (Ms. Shanahan and Messrs. Albert, Dickerson, Levenson, Steger, Steuert, and Walsh), and one director who serves as Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Petterson). The Board believes its current leadership structure strikes an appropriate balance between independent directors and directors affiliated with the Company, which allows the Board to effectively represent the best interests of the Company and its stockholder base. 
The position of the independent Board Chair, or the Lead Director when the Chief Executive Officer is concurrently serving as the Board Chair, is intended to provide a check and balance on the role and responsibilities of the Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that the independent Board Chair is a strategic role that continues to add value to the Company.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
GOVERNANCE DOCUMENTS 
Committee Charters 
Each committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at www.gldd.com or may be obtained by writing to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office. 
Code of Ethics 
We have a written Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the "Code") that applies to all members of the Board and our employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, controller and persons performing similar functions. The Code is reviewed and updated on a regular basis, and a new version of the Code was adopted by the Board in May 2018. All of our salaried employees have reviewed and certified compliance with the Code. In addition, on an annual basis, all of our directors and salaried employees receive training on the Code. Senior management, as well as individuals with responsibility for foreign operations or purchasing, receives additional training on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other international compliance topics. 
Our Code can be found on our website at www.gldd.com. We will post on our website any amendments to or waivers of the Code for executive officers or directors, in accordance with applicable laws, regulations and listing standards. A copy also may be obtained by writing to our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' ROLE IN ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT 
As part of our risk management process, senior management discusses and identifies major areas of risk on an ongoing basis and periodically reviews these risks with the Board. The Company's management process is designed to enable the Board to best determine our risk management profile and oversee our risk management strategies. The Board delegated oversight of this enterprise risk management process to the Audit Committee. This process employs a framework for identifying and assessing key strategic, operational, financial and compliance risks based upon guidelines of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). The Company has adopted the COSO 2013 framework for internal controls. This framework has allowed the Company to enhance its internal control environment, which is an integral part of enterprise risk management. The product of this process is a risk management overview that is shared with the Audit Committee. 
Assessment of Risks in our Executive Compensation Program 
We do not believe risks arising from our executive and broad-based compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company or our business, nor do we believe that the executive compensation programs encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking. 
The Compensation Committee reviews and approves corporate goals relating to our Chief Executive Officer's compensation and approves total compensation for our senior executives. In addition, as part of our risk management process, senior management periodically identifies and discusses major areas of risk with the Board. As part of its regular reports to the Board, the Committee discusses the potential for unnecessary or excessive risk taking. For more detail on the process by which executive compensation is set, see "Compensation Philosophy and Objectives," page 25. 
Specifically, the Board and the Compensation Committee control risks arising from executive compensation policies and practices in part by controlling the mix of cash and long-term equity incentives. Executives' base salaries are fixed in amount and thus do not encourage risk-taking. Annual incentives are capped for all named executive officers at 200% of target and annual incentives for all of our named executive officers are tied to overall corporate performance and individual objectives, which may include individual business unit performance. The compensation provided to the executive officers in the form of long-term equity awards helps further align executives' interests with those of the Company's stockholders. The Compensation Committee believes that these awards do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking because the ultimate value of the awards is tied to the Company's stock price and operating performance and because awards are staggered and subject to long-term vesting schedules. Our long-term equity awards in combination with our stock ownership requirements help ensure that executives have significant value tied to long-term stock price performance and therefore are cognizant of how short-term decisions impact the long-term health of the organization. 
In addition, management, the Compensation Committee and the Board each consider the risks associated with accounting and reporting, project cost estimating, compliance and safety. More specifically, the Compensation Committee retains subjective discretion in some instances to adjust short-term incentive formulas, which allows the Compensation Committee to review the results from the fiscal year and determine whether, despite achievement of financial goals, the intents and purposes of the Executive Leadership Annual Incentive Plan were met. In doing so, the Compensation Committee may consider whether activities taken during that fiscal year comport with the Company's strategic plan and align management objectives with stockholder interests. As a result, the incentive may be adjusted on an individual basis, independent of achievement of formulaic targets. 
In addition, certain awards granted in 2018 under our long-term incentive plan are comprised of equity that vests over a three-year period. These equity awards were structured to induce our executive officers to focus on the long-term capital appreciation, health and viability of the Company rather than a short-term increase in stock price. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Finally, the Company has a Recoupment Policy, which requires certain compensation to be repaid to the Company if awarded as a result of misstated earnings. The Board will re-evaluate and, if necessary, revise the Recoupment Policy to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 
SELECTION OF NOMINEES FOR BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Nomination Process 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for evaluating potential candidates to serve on our Board and for recommending nominees to be presented for election or reelection to the Board at our Annual Meeting of stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not set specific minimum qualifications for director positions. In evaluating potential director candidates, including incumbent directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the skills and characteristics possessed by each candidate in the context of the perceived needs of the Board in an effort to ensure there is a blend of skills and experience that will enhance the effectiveness of the Board. 
In addition, whenever a new seat or a vacated seat on the Board is being filled, candidates that appear to best fit our needs are identified, and unless such individuals are well known to the Board, they are interviewed and further evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Candidates selected by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are then recommended to the Board. After the Board approves a candidate, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee extends an invitation to the candidate to join the Board. 
When evaluating director candidates and considering incumbent directors for re-nomination to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers a variety of factors. Among the factors considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are the following: 
In identifying potential candidates for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee relies on recommendations from a number of possible sources, including current directors and officers. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also retain outside consultants or search firms to help identify potential candidates for membership on the Board. 
Recommendation of Candidates by Stockholders 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider stockholder recommendations for candidates for membership on the Board, provided that a complete description of such proposed nominee's qualifications, experience and background, together with a statement signed by each proposed nominee in which he or she consents to act as such, accompanies the recommendations, and provided further that any such recommendation must also be made according to the procedures, and within the same time deadlines, applicable under our Bylaws to director nominations. Such recommendations should be submitted in writing to the Corporate Secretary and should not include self-nominations. Director candidates recommended by stockholders will be evaluated using the same criteria as those applied to other director candidates. 
COMMUNICATING WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Stockholders and other interested parties wishing to communicate with our Board of Directors can send communications to one or more members of the Board by writing to the Board or to specific directors (including independent directors or committee chairs) or to a group of directors at the following address: 
Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation Board of Directors c/o Corporate Secretary 
Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation 
2122 York Road 
Oak Brook, Illinois 60523 
Any such communication will be promptly distributed by the Corporate Secretary to the individual director or directors named in the communication or to all directors if the communication is addressed to the entire Board of Directors. Every effort has been made to ensure that the views of stockholders are heard by the Board of Directors or individual directors, as applicable, and that appropriate responses are provided to stockholders in a timely manner. 
PROPOSAL NO. 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
BOARD COMPOSITION 
Our Board is currently composed of eight members divided into three classes. The members of each class are elected to serve three-year terms with the term of office of each class ending in successive years. Messrs. Albert, Dickerson, Steger and Steuert are members of the class whose term expires at the 2019 Annual Meeting. At the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the class size will be reduced to three and the size of the Board will be reduced to seven. Messrs. Levenson and Walsh are members of the class whose term expires at the 2020 Annual Meeting. Mr. Petterson and Ms. Shanahan are members of the class whose terms expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting. 
The Board of Directors has nominated Messrs. Dickerson, Steger and Steuert for election at the Annual Meeting to the Board of Directors for three-year terms expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and to hold office until their respective successors are elected and qualified or until their earlier death, disqualification, resignation or removal. Messrs. Dickerson, Steger and Steuert have each indicated a willingness to serve. 
The persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote the proxies received by them for the election of Messrs. Dickerson, Steger and Steuert, unless otherwise directed. In the event that a nominee becomes unavailable for election at the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies in the enclosed proxy card may vote for a substitute nominee at their discretion as recommended by the Board. 
VOTE REQUIRED AND RECOMMENDATION 
The nominees for director will be elected for three-year terms, provided that they receive a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. This means that, if a quorum is present, the three persons receiving the greatest number of votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected to serve as directors. As a result, withholding authority to vote for a director nominee and broker non-votes with respect to the election of directors will not affect the outcome of the election of directors. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named in this proxy statement, which is three.

2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The compensation of our directors is determined by the Compensation Committee and ratified by the Board. Directors who are employees of the Company do not receive separate compensation for their services on the Board. The annual compensation package for our non-employee directors is designed to attract and retain highly experienced and qualified individuals to serve on the Board and promote a strong alignment of interests between the Company's non-employee directors and its stockholders. 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews the design of the annual compensation package for non-employees directors. The Company believes that the compensation of our non-employee directors fairly reflects the work and skills required for a company of our size and complexity. The compensation package was established following consultation with FW Cook, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, and was intended to be competitive relative to the Company's peer group and general industry market data. No changes to our non-employee director compensation program were made during 2018. 
Each of our non-employee directors currently receives an annual retainer of $155,000, payable quarterly in arrears. The retainer is generally payable 50% in cash and 50% in grants of fully vested shares of our common stock at the end of each fiscal quarter. Following the adoption of the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2017 LTIP"), either the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee or the Compensation Committee may be responsible for reviewing and approving grants of common stock to our non-employee directors. In addition to the annual retainer, our Board approved the annual retainers for committee service or committee chair service, as applicable, as set forth below. The committee annual retainers are paid in cash to the committee members each quarter in arrears. Directors are permitted to elect to receive a greater percentage of their annual retainers in common stock rather than cash.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS 
Non-employee directors are subject to a stock retention requirement and are required to retain common stock in the amount of five times the annual cash retainer received for service as a member of the Board. For 2018, that amount was $387,500 in common stock. Until the required ownership level is achieved, non-employee directors are required to hold at least 50% of the shares received as equity compensation (after taxes). All directors have either achieved the required ownership level or are in compliance with the retention requirement. 
PROPOSAL NO. 2 – RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019. During 2018, Deloitte & Touche LLP also served as our independent registered public accounting firm and, in addition, provided certain tax and other audit-related services, see "Matters Related to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm – Professional Fees" on page 21. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement. 
VOTE REQUIRED AND RECOMMENDATION 
Deloitte & Touche LLP will be ratified as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 provided this proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon, assuming a quorum is present. Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, will have the effect of voting against the proposal. 
Although we are not required to seek stockholder ratification of this appointment, the Audit Committee and the Board believe it to be sound corporate practice to do so. If the appointment is not ratified, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.

AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICY FOR INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT SERVICES 
The Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. From time to time, however, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee may also pre-approve services on a case-by-case basis. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. For the year ended December 31, 2018 the Audit Committee pre-approved all such audit and non-audit services, including tax services, provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.

 Name     Title 
Lasse J. Petterson     Chief Executive Officer 
Mark W. Marinko     Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
Kathleen M. LaVoy     Senior Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary 
Christopher P. Shea*         President of the Environmental & Infrastructure Division 
David E. Simonelli     President of the Dredging Division 
 * Due to the placement of the Environmental & Infrastructure Division into  discontinued operations, effective January 1, 2019, the Company does not consider Mr. Shea an executive officer under Rule 3b-7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Executive Summary 
2018 Business Overview 
In 2018, we believe we executed successfully on our strategic initiatives, which emphasized completing our restructuring plan and strengthening our balance sheet to position the Company for future investments and positive growth for our stockholders. We continued to strengthen our relationships with key clients by providing innovative solutions and by delivering cost-effective and time-efficient project completions. We achieved these objectives in 2018, while at the same time, delivering improved financial results and continuing a trend of exceptional safety performance. We strive to create the safest project and facility sites in the dredging industry and, in 2018, we saw a 27% reduction in our recordable injury rate. During the year, we also reviewed our environmental and infrastructure segment and concluded that, while it has experienced improvement from prior years, the business is not well-aligned enough with our core dredging business to continue operating it under our portfolio of assets, and we intend to divest the business in the first half of 2019. 
2018 Financial Review 
Our financial performance for the year was driven by excellent fleet utilization and project execution and included improvement in a number of key financial metrics. The Company continued to execute on its restructuring and other cost saving initiatives and completed the year ahead of plan. Other notable financial achievements include:

Pay-for-Performance
As discussed in more detail below, a primary goal of our executive compensation program is to achieve accountability for performance by linking elements of executive compensation to achievement of measurable performance objectives that reflect our strategic plan. Because the majority of total direct compensation is in the form of performance-based variable pay awards (annual incentive awards and long-term incentive equity awards), the aggregate total direct compensation of our executives is designed to increase when the Company's performance exceeds, and to decrease when the Company's performance falls short of, our strategic and financial goals. Total direct compensation for each of our executives can also increase or decrease based on individual performance. We also measure our target total direct compensation relative to a peer group of companies; see "Competitive Market Review" on page 27. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In 2018, we believe our executive compensation program met our goal of driving performance. As is detailed more fully in Changes to the 2018 Executive Program below, given the ongoing, successful execution of the aggressive restructuring plan introduced in 2017 and other important strategic initiatives including debt reduction, the Compensation Committee introduced a special, one-time long-term incentive program that rewarded significant over-achievement of our financial goals. The CEO recommended but did not participate in this program. We believe that this program in particular drove the extraordinary financial improvement in 2018: quantitative goals were over-achieved in 2018 as compared to target and were far superior to 2017 achievement, and qualitative goals were met or exceeded. As a result, compensation for our executives was greater than target.

Compensation Program Reflects Best Practices 
We designed our executive compensation program to drive performance toward the achievement of our short-term and long-term goals and to increase stockholder value, while appropriately balancing risk and reward. In March 2018, the Compensation Committee (for purposes of this "Executive Compensation" section of the proxy statement, the "Committee") conducted its annual review and risk assessment of the Company's executive compensation policies and practices. Following this review, the Committee concluded that our executive compensation program was appropriately designed for the size and complexity of the Company and was not reasonably likely to encourage excessive risk-taking. The Committee intends to regularly review our executive compensation program and incorporate commonly viewed best practices as it deems appropriate; examples of best practices that we have adopted include: 
"Say-on-Pay" Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 59% of voting stockholders cast an advisory vote in support of the Company's executive compensation program, which was lower than the historic stockholder support received for the program. The Committee considered this vote during its annual examination of the executive compensation program as one of many factors in deciding the Company's ongoing executive compensation policies and procedures. Although the Committee had already made a number of changes to the executive compensation program prior to the advisory vote, as a result of the historically low support, the Committee determined to engage in specific stockholder outreach regarding the executive compensation program; see "Say-on-Pay Vote and Subsequent Investor Outreach" on page 5. 
Changes to the 2018 Executive Compensation Program 
The Committee reviews our executive compensation program on a continuous basis and, in 2017, made several significant changes for 2018 and onward that we believe will align our executive compensation program with the achievement of our long-term strategic goals. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
First, the Committee decided to fund all of the named executive officers' annual incentive compensation based on the entire Company's results, as opposed to funding the business segment leaders' incentive pools on business segment results. We believe that this change enhances alignment across our divisions and among our named executive officers. Business segment leaders do continue to have individual goals based on the performance of their respective divisions, which may increase or decrease the formulaic payout determined based on Company results. 
Second, the Committee determined that performance-based restricted stock units under our 2018 program would vest based on the achievement of performance metrics related to earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") because, as we are a capital intensive company, we believe that the use of EBIT (which includes our depreciation expense) ties a significant portion of executive compensation to the achievement of both our earnings growth and capital efficiency goals. 
Third, the Committee approved the implementation of a special one-time long-term incentive program. This program was recommended to the Committee by our CEO, but is for all long-term incentive plan participants other than himself. The special program was designed to incentivize the continued focus of the senior management team on the goals set forth in our restructuring plan with respect to both operational performance and cost savings targets. This supplemental program includes a significant stretch target goal, is entirely performance-based using two successive one-year stretch target goals based on earnings before taxes ("EBT"), includes an additional one-year post-performance period vesting period and is self-funded, meaning that the increase in earnings achieved exceeded the amount paid out in additional incentives. The Committee chose EBT because it wanted to specifically drive debt reduction in addition to the earnings growth and capital efficiency goals mentioned above. 
Summary of Compensation Key Elements 
The following table outlines the framework of the main elements of our executive compensation program for our named executive officers. Each element serves a different yet critical purpose in achieving the objectives of the program. Overall executive compensation is structured to place an increasingly larger amount of compensation at risk at successively higher levels of management. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
The Company's executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain highly skilled, performance-oriented executives and closely align compensation paid to our named executive officers with our operating and financial goals. The Committee regularly discusses the general principles that form the basis of our executive compensation program. The objectives, which guided the Committee's executive compensation decisions in 2018, are discussed below. 
Aligning Compensation with Stockholder Interests 
The primary goal of our executive compensation program is to align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. The key elements utilized to help achieve such an alignment include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Rewarding Both Annual and Long-Term Performance, with an Emphasis on Long-Term Performance 
The various components of our executive compensation program are intended to reward the achievement of both annual and long-term strategic and financial performance by the Company, the Company's business divisions, and individual executives. In all cases, objectives place a greater emphasis on long-term, sustainable performance. The key pay elements utilized to help drive performance include:

Motivating and Retaining Employees 
It is our goal to provide opportunities that are generally competitive with our peer companies in order to attract, motivate and retain highly experienced employees in key executive positions. These opportunities include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓ a competitive total direct  compensation package consisting of base salary, performance-based annual incentive award, and long-term equity awards;   ✓ employment agreements with our executives, which contain severance and  change in control protections; and   ✓ a Supplemental Savings Plan, a deferred compensation program providing a tax-advantaged method for our executives to save for retirement by deferring salary and annual  incentive compensation and to receive matching and profit sharing contributions.

Mix of Compensation 
In light of the focus of our executive compensation program on sustainable long-term performance and increased stockholder value, the majority of total direct compensation for our named executive officers is granted in the form of variable compensation. The following chart illustrates the relative value of the fixed and variable compensation components for our ongoing 2018 total direct compensation program (base salary, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive equity awards) as a percentage of 2018 total direct compensation. The below percentages do not include the performance-based equity granted under the 2018 Special Incentive Program to the named executive officers (for purposes of this "Mix of Compensation" section of the proxy statement, the "NEOs") other than the CEO, as it is not a part of the named executive officers' ongoing compensation package. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
TARGET COMPENSATION OPPORTUNITY (Ongoing Program) 
Implementation of Compensation Objectives 
Our annual executive compensation review is undertaken at the direction and under the supervision of the Committee. Our CEO provides recommendations regarding the compensation of the other named executive officers, but is not involved in setting his own compensation. 
Generally, in the first and fourth quarter of each year, the Committee reviews our historical pay, Company and individual performance information, including our performance relative to the objectives set forth in the prior year's incentive program. Based on our performance, as well as recommendations from our CEO for executive officers other than himself, the Committee approves annual incentive awards for executive officers. The Committee also determines the executive compensation program for the current year. As part of this process, the Committee reviews the aggregate value of the total compensation opportunities provided to each of the executive officers. Following the review, the Committee determines annual base salaries, target annual incentive compensation, and long-term incentive opportunities for each executive officer. The Committee also approves the goals and performance metrics for our annual incentive compensation and the performance-based component of our long-term incentives. In the first quarter of 2018, the Committee set performance goals for the annual incentive compensation and long-term incentive programs. When calculating achievement of performance goals, budgeted and actual incentive pay is excluded from the calculation due to circular reference. 
Long-term incentives are awarded pursuant to the 2017 LTIP, a stockholder approved equity plan. Every year, the Committee reviews the mix of types of incentives and the percentage of each type of incentive granted. In 2018, the Committee chose to grant restricted stock units with a combination of performance-based and service-based vesting conditions. The Committee believes this mix of grant types motivates key executives to drive business results against the Company's goals, further aligns management's interests with those of our stockholders over the long-term, and retains individuals deemed critical to the Company's future success. 
It is the Committee's policy to authorize and grant equity awards as of the date of the Committee meeting at which such awards are approved by the independent directors who serve on the Committee, based upon the fair market value of our common stock as of the grant date of the award. The Committee determines the value of the award to be made to each recipient and the terms and conditions of the awards including the applicable time and performance vesting criteria. For additional detail on the Company's grants in 2018, refer to "Long-Term Incentive Awards" on page 30. 
Throughout the year, the Committee discusses the philosophy for the overall executive compensation packages and decides whether changes should be made in the design of the program. 
Role of Management in Establishing Compensation 
At the direction of the Committee Chair, management generally prepares materials for the Committee in advance of its meetings. During the annual evaluation process, the CEO evaluates the performance of our named executive officers (other than himself) and other senior executives and provides a recommendation to the Committee with respect to changes to base salary, annual performance incentive, and long-term incentive equity awards. As part of regular Committee meetings, Committee members generally meet in executive session, during which members of management are not present. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Consultant 
Pursuant to its charter, the Committee has the independent authority to engage the services of outside advisors and experts, including executive compensation consultants. The role of the compensation consultant is to provide independent, expert advice to the Committee on the design of the Company's compensation programs and the level of compensation paid to our senior executives. The Committee engaged FW Cook as its compensation consultant with respect to 2018 executive compensation matters, including an assessment of the reasonableness of executive compensation levels and the appropriateness of the Company's executive program structure in supporting the Company's business objectives. In 2018, the Compensation Consultant also advised on the design and implementation of the Special Incentive Program. 
The Compensation Consultant reports directly to the Committee and was not utilized to perform any other services for the Company. The Committee has assessed the independence of the Compensation Consultant and concluded that its work is independent of management and does not raise any conflict of interest. The Committee has the authority to hire and dismiss the Compensation Consultant, as well as to establish new engagements. If requested by the Committee, a representative of the Compensation Consultant may participate in Committee meetings. Management did not engage a separate executive compensation consultant during 2018. 
For purposes of this proxy statement, the term "Compensation Consultant" refers to FW Cook. 
Competitive Market Review 
The Committee considers salary, annual incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation for the named executive officers against competitive market information. In 2018, the peer group consisted of the following 15 companies ("Peer Group"): 
The Committee selected this Peer Group with the assistance of its Compensation Consultant, after considering U.S. based public companies in the same and similar Global Industry Classification System (GICS) Industry Group with comparable revenues, total assets and enterprise value. The Compensation Consultant considered companies with similar lines of business as the Company, namely asset-intensive companies that provide infrastructure and engineering services and are of similar size to Great Lakes. The Compensation Consultant recommended maintaining a similar peer group as utilized for 2018 executive compensation decisions, removing Granite Construction and Tetra Tech and adding Badger Daylighting and NV5 Global. Select comparative financial measures for the Peer Group are summarized below:

 Median/Percentiles determined by FW Cook using Standard & Poor's Capital IQ  Service and Peer Group company information. The financial information referenced above is derived from data as of September 30, 2018. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee utilizes the Peer Group as a reference point for decisions relating to our executive compensation program involving our named executive officers. Executive compensation data from the Peer Group is aggregated by the Compensation Consultant and presented to the Committee in summary form. The Committee reviews the aggregated data to obtain a general understanding of current executive compensation practices utilized by our Peer Group and as a market check that the Company's pay practices are generally competitive and fulfill the Committee's stated goal of attracting and retaining its named executive officers. The Committee does not target specific levels of executive compensation as compared to the Peer Group. 
On an annual basis, the Compensation Consultant provides a competitive market assessment, which includes a report on the compensation of our named executive officers, relative to a market median (developed based on an analysis of the compensation elements from the Peer Group). The Committee considers the competitive market assessment when making its final executive compensation decisions, and it is the Committee's current intention to continue annual competitive market assessments to evaluate whether our senior executives are compensated appropriately in terms of levels and design. 
Components of Executive Compensation 
The primary elements of our compensation program for named executive officers are base salary, an annual incentive opportunity, and long-term incentive awards. Each component is designed to contribute to a total executive compensation package that is competitive, performance-based, and supportive of our financial and strategic goals. In determining the total compensation of the named executive officers, the Committee considers our operating and financial performance as a whole as well as each executive's execution of the responsibilities associated with his or her respective position. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Base Salary 
We seek to provide competitive base salaries that allow us to attract and retain executive talent without incurring excessive fixed costs. Accordingly, we consider a variety of factors such as salaries of executives in similar positions in our Peer Group, our executives' skills, experience, and knowledge, responsibilities required of the executives in their roles, importance of the position to the Company and the difficulty of replacement. Increases to executives' base salaries also result in increases to annual incentive opportunities and long-term incentive awards because target annual incentive compensation and target long-term incentives are calculated as a percentage of base salary. 
Effective January 1, 2018, most of our continuing named executive officers received salary increases. Decisions regarding individual salary levels were based upon a review of multiple criteria including market data of our Peer Group, the individual's performance, the Company's performance and the advice of the Compensation Consultant. Nominal base salary increases were provided to our named executive officers based on Peer Group and general market data.

Annual Incentive Compensation 
The Company's annual incentive compensation program is designed to be supportive of the Company's short-term operating objectives and to provide competitive target total annual executive compensation opportunities. In 2018, the Company granted annual incentive compensation pursuant to the Executive Leadership Annual Incentive Program, which was administered under the 2017 LTIP. All of our named executive officers participated in the program, which was designed by the Committee. 
The target incentive pool was equal to the sum of each participant's individual target with the actual incentive pool funded based on achievement of certain Company financial performance measures. Performance for the named executive officers other than the CEO was measured based 80% on the financial results of the Company as a whole (measured using EBITDA, excluding restructuring) and 20% on individual goals focused on execution of the Company's strategic plan and other priorities of the Company. Performance for the CEO was measured based solely on the financial results of the Company as a whole. The Committee also considered, but did not assign a specific weight to, the individual qualitative goals listed below when determining whether to modify the CEO's actual award. The metrics selected by the Committee for purposes of determining annual incentive compensation consisted of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Incentive Compensation Metric    How Measured    Why Chosen? 
 Annual Incentive Compensation Metric    How Measured    Why Chosen? 
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
As noted above, Adjusted EBITDA was measured based on the financial results of the entire Company, excluding restructuring. Although the Company decided to place the environmental & infrastructure business into discontinued operations at the end of 2018, because there had been a full year of financial performance for the business and the target Adjusted EBITDA goals were determined originally based on the inclusion of the business, the Committee elected not to adjust the metric by excluding the environmental & infrastructure business financial results when measuring the Company's Adjusted EBITDA performance. Thus, the metric was based on historic operations of the Company (consistent with the financial target set at the beginning of the year) and not on continuing operations. Had the Committee elected to adjust the financial targets to exclude discontinued operations, the performance-based compensation would have earned at a higher level. 
For 2018, the Committee set a Company Adjusted EBITDA (excluding restructuring) target of $93.4 million, which represented a 63% increase over the prior year's actual Company Adjusted EBITDA performance for incentive purposes of $57.3 million. Company Adjusted EBITDA as compared to budget funded the incentive pool for the Executives was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Adjusted EBITDA vs. Budget Performance Level     Pool Funding     (% Target)     
      Adjusted EBITDA vs. Budget Performance Level     Pool Funding     (% Target)     
      Adjusted EBITDA vs. Budget Performance Level     Pool Funding     (% Target)     
 Threshold      $65.38MM        50%      
 Target      $93.40MM        100%      
 Maximum    >$121.42MM           200%      
Performance between threshold and target and target and maximum are linearly interpolated.    
[END TABLE]
Actual Company Adjusted EBITDA, excluding restructuring, of $105.5 million was above target and funded the portion of the Executive's incentive allocation to Company performance at 156% of target. The Committee retains subjective discretion to adjust payout results as it deems appropriate and in accordance with the terms of the plan. Adjustments are generally intended to mitigate the effects of unanticipated events that, unless excluded, would be inconsistent with the intent of the annual incentive compensation program. In 2018, the Committee did not exercise its subjective discretion to adjust the quantitative performance measures. 
Individual Performance Consideration 
Once the financial and individual goals are calculated and weighted, the annual incentive pool is allocated to the key executives based on overall individual performance, as approved by the Committee after considering each executive's performance and the recommendation of the CEO. Decisions regarding actual individual incentive awards are based upon funded amounts for the annual incentive pool and a qualitative evaluation of the key executive's performance and the executive's individual contribution to overall company performance. While the Committee may modify calculated annual incentives from 0-150% based on individual performance, individual modifications are expected to be generally +/- 10% of calculated amounts, except in extraordinary circumstances. Each named executive officer typically submits a written self-appraisal regarding the achievement of his or her pre-established qualitative goals for the year. The pre-established qualitative goals are ordinarily set at the beginning of the performance period for each named executive officer and are designed to motivate performance with respect to other stated strategic, operational, financial and corporate objectives. This year, the named executive officers' qualitative assessment also included individual goals based on strategic initiatives set by the CEO and individual execution of certain elements relating to these strategic initiatives. For the named executive officers other than the CEO, the appraisals are reviewed by the CEO. Mr. Petterson provided performance appraisals for each of the named executive officers, which were then discussed with the Committee. The self-appraisal for the CEO is discussed with the Committee. The Committee, in its subjective judgment, awarded annual incentive awards to the key executives based on both achievements of these qualitative goals as well as the quantitative Adjusted EBITDA goal discussed above. 
Each of our named executive officers received actual payouts in March 2019 under their respective 2018 performance-based annual incentive award as reflected in the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Lasse J. Petterson        90%           $630,000               $984,816         156% 
   Mark W. Marinko        50%       $197,374               $290,250         147% 
   Kathleen M. LaVoy        50%       $175,100               $256,620         147% 
   Christopher P. Shea        40%       $147,084               $206,000         140% 
   David E.  Simonelli        55%       $231,132               $371,124         161% 
[END TABLE]
As mentioned throughout and discussed in more detail below, Mr. Petterson did not participate in the Special Incentive Program, which he recommended for other Company leaders as a means to incentivize extraordinary performance. The Committee discussed the exclusion of the CEO from the Special Incentive Program in light of the overall Company performance and concluded that special recognition was justified based on Mr. Petterson's contributions to the execution of our operating achievements that drove our strong performance.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In taking such action, the Committee considered whether it was appropriate to make a discretionary compensation decision but concluded that the extraordinary performance warranted the action. In particular, the Committee assigned significant weight to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Mr. Pettersons strong leadership in driving a multi-year turnaround, founded on execution of a  challenging restructuring plan and installation of operational and financial discipline;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Significant year-over-year improvements in financial metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Material reduction in the Companys leverage, ahead of schedule; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Increase in the Companys stock price during 2018 of 26% ($5.25 to $6.62) and increase from January 1,  2018 through March 1, 2019 (i.e. following 2018 earnings release) of 40% ($5.25 to $8.74).  
[END TABLE]
Accordingly, the Committee awarded Mr. Petterson a special recognition bonus in the amount of $500,000, to be paid half in cash and half in equity (based on the closing price of the stock on the date bonuses were paid). The Committee noted that this amount was considerably less than Mr. Petterson would have earned in 2018 had he participated in the Special Incentive Program. 
Long-Term Incentive Awards 
The 2017 LTIP permits the Company to grant restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and other awards to eligible individuals, which awards may be subject to one or more performance measures selected from a broad range of permitted performance goals. 
The Committee considers and reviews many factors in determining the appropriate mix of long-term equity incentive awards, including the prevalence and composition of equity awards reported in the competitive market assessment and the mix of awards required to effectively incentivize management, and reward the creation of value for stockholders and strong overall strategic and financial performance. For 2018, the Committee selected the following forms of Long-Term Incentives:

performance of the Company during the vesting period. The Committee also considers long-term incentive equity compensation levels of our Peer Group and the annual competitive market assessment. While the Company maintains stock ownership guidelines (see "Other Compensation Related Matters – Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines" on page 32), the Committee does not consider existing stock ownership levels of individual executives in determining the amount of long-term incentive equity awards. 
Target values for 2018 awards were determined by the Committee in conjunction with its consideration of the 2018 competitive market assessment. In March 2018, the named executive officers were granted a mix of RSUs and PSUs with target opportunities as a percentage of salary. In addition, the Special Incentive Program was also granted to incentivize delivery of strategic plan elements and align interests of management with stockholders, as discussed more fully above. 
The total grants and grant-date fair values for the LTI awards granted under the regular program are as follows:

The Committee determined that each performance metric was achieved for the respective performance period and, as a result, the named executive officers were issued the 2018 regular PSUs. The SIPs were earned but remain subject to time vesting requirements. Specifically, actual Company EBIT, excluding restructuring, was $57.6 million (earning at 200% of target for the PSUs) and actual Company EBT, excluding restructuring, was $24.9 million (earning at 197% of target for the SIPs). The tables below identify the EBIT performance criteria for the outstanding PSU grants and the EBT performance criteria for the outstanding SIP grants for the 2018 performance periods:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
OTHER COMPENSATION RELATED MATTERS 
Additional Benefits 
The Company has adopted benefit programs that are supportive of business and human resource strategies and that provide for the delivery of equitable value to executives relative to lower level employees. The Company strives to avoid programs that do not support an identifiable business objective. 
Accordingly, the named executive officers generally participate in the same benefits program that is provided to other employees, including life and medical insurance and 401(k) matching and profit sharing. Our 401(k) plan provides that we will match, dollar for dollar, up to 6% of an employee's salary and incentive compensation that is contributed to his or her 401(k) account. We also may provide a profit sharing contribution to an employee's 401(k) account as a percentage (between 0% and 7%) of the employee's salary. However, the IRS limits the total annual contribution for an employee into a qualified plan. This amount was $18,500 for 2018. 
Supplemental Savings Plan 
In addition, our named executive officers as well as other eligible employees may contribute to a Supplemental Savings Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to elect to defer salary and annual incentive compensation and to receive matching and profit sharing contributions in excess of the maximum amounts that they can defer or receive under the 401(k) plan due to IRS limits. Although the Supplemental Savings Plan is unfunded, participants may elect to notionally invest deferred amounts in most of the investment alternatives that are available under the qualified 401(k) plan. Participants also elect when to receive distributions of deferred amounts under the Supplemental Savings Plan. No tax gross-ups will be provided to participants under the Supplemental Savings Plan. In 2018, all of the eligible named executive officers participated in the Supplemental Savings Plan. 
Compensation Recoupment ("Clawback") Policy 
We have a compensation recoupment policy which requires certain cash and equity incentive compensation to be repaid to the Company if awarded as a result of inaccurate financial data. The policy applies to current and former executive officers of the Company, as well as other employees designated by the Board or the Committee. In addition, the policy allows the Committee to recoup compensation paid to an employee as a result of any conduct justifying termination for cause of that employee. 
Employment Agreements 
As of December 31, 2018, and discussed beginning on page 38, all of our continuing named executive officers had written employment agreements which would entitle each executive to severance benefits depending upon the circumstances of resignation or termination. The Committee believes that these agreements provide essential protections to both the named executive officers and the Company. Agreements providing for severance and change-in-control payments assist us in attracting and retaining qualified executives who have job alternatives. At the same time, the applicable agreements preserve our valuable assets by imposing upon the executives' non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions, confidentiality obligations, and cooperation covenants. 
The Board and the Committee believe that retention of key personnel is an important goal, and employment agreements are one vehicle for retaining top talent and are in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders, particularly in the context of any potential transaction. The Board and Committee believe that the severance benefits agreed to in the case of these termination events are reasonable in light of the potential value delivered to stockholders in return. These agreements do not provide excise tax gross-ups. 
Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines 
The Company maintains guidelines for stock ownership with respect to its named executive officers, senior executives and vice presidents. The purpose of the guidelines is to encourage our executives and vice presidents to demonstrate a commitment to the 
Company and its stockholders by retaining a required value of Company stock. Each executive and vice president is provided with a reasonable period of time to attain the required ownership level. The guidelines provide that each named executive officer retain a number of eligible shares with a value at least equal to a multiple of his or her base annual salary as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name    Position     Retention Requirement 
Name    Position     Retention Requirement 
 Lasse J. Petterson    Chief Executive Officer        5.0x salary      
 Mark W. Marinko    Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer        3.0x salary      
 Kathleen M. LaVoy    Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary        3.0x salary      
 Christopher P. Shea    President of Environmental & Infrastructure Division        2.0x salary      
 David E. Simonelli(1)    President of Dredging Division        3.0x salary      
 (1)   For Mr. Simonelli, vested but unexercised options granted  prior to 2014 are valued using the Black-Scholes model and count towards a portion of his retention requirement. 
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
All shares of common stock are eligible shares and count towards the retention requirement, with the shares of common stock valued using an average of the closing stock price over the prior month. Each named executive officer must retain 50% of net profit shares realized upon the: (i) exercise of stock options, (ii) settlement of performance-based restricted stock units, and (iii) vesting of restricted stock units until the required retention value is attained. As of December 31, 2018, each of our named executive officers was in compliance with the guidelines through meeting the retention requirement or complying with the retention ratio of 50% of net profit shares. 
Derivatives Trading and Pledging 
Because a primary goal of our equity-based incentive compensation program is to align the interests of our senior executives with those of our stockholders, we discourage the trading of derivative securities related to shares of our stock, including hedging strategies, puts, calls or other types of derivative securities. Our derivatives policy also discourages pledging shares of our stock. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS WITH INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
The Compensation Committee is comprised of Ryan J. Levenson (Chair), Kathleen M. Shanahan and Michael J. Walsh, none of whom is an employee or current or former officer of our Company, or any of the Company's subsidiaries, nor had any relationship with our Company requiring disclosure. The Board has determined that Messrs. Levenson, Walsh and Ms. Shanahan are independent in accordance with NASDAQ listing rules. There were no interlocking relationships during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on such review and discussions with the Company's management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

(1)  Represents the aggregate grant date fair value for restricted stock units and performance–based restricted  stock units granted in 2018. The amounts reported in this column are calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The amounts included for the performance–based restricted stock units granted during 2018 are calculated based on the  probable outcome of the performance conditions for such awards at the time of grant, which was achievement of the target performance conditions. If the highest level of performance is achieved for these performance–based restricted stock units,  the maximum value of these awards at the grant date would be as follows: Mr. Petterson, $666,667; Mr. Marinko, $157,901; Ms. LaVoy, $93,389; Mr. Shea, $216,667; and Mr. Simonelli, $210,120. The amount included for the  Special Incentive Program is zero, because the probable outcome of the performance condition at the time of award was less than the threshold amount. If the highest level of performance is achieved for the Special Incentive Program, the maximum  value of these award at the grant date would be as follows: Mr. Marinko, $473,698, Ms. LaVoy, $280,162, Mr. Shea, $294,168; and Mr. Simonelli, $630,360 The assumptions used in determining the FASB ASC Topic 718 values are set  forth in Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, see "Grants of Plan Based Awards Table" on  page 35 for more information regarding the equity compensation granted in 2018 to our named executive officers.

We maintain a nonqualified SSP for certain of our employees on United States payroll, including each of our named executive officers. Under the SSP, participants may defer up to 50% of their salaries, including commissions and incentive compensation (other than annual incentives), and may make a separate election to defer up to 100% of any annual performance-based cash incentives (after applicable taxes) they may earn. The SSP also provides participants the opportunity to receive credits for matching contributions equal to the difference between the matching contributions that a participant could receive under the Company's 401(k) Plan but for the contribution and compensation limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, and the matching contributions allowable to the participant under the Company's 401(k) Plan, excluding in each case any such elective deferrals that exceed 6% of such Participant's compensation for such Plan Year, as defined in the Company's 401(k) Plan. Participants are generally permitted to choose from among the investment funds available under the Company's 401(k) Plan for purposes of determining the imputed earnings, gains, and losses applicable to their SSP accounts. The SSP is unfunded. Participants may specify the timing of the payment of their accounts by choosing either a specified payment date or electing payment upon separation from service (or a date up to five years following separation from service), and in either case may elect to receive their accounts in a lump sum or in annual or quarterly installments over a period of up to ten years. With respect to each year's contributions and imputed earnings, the participant may make a separate distribution election. Subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, applicable Internal Revenue Service guidance, and the terms of the SSP, participants may receive an early payment in the event of a severe financial hardship and may make an election to delay the timing of their scheduled payment by a minimum of five years. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Overview 
The following describes the estimated payments that would be made to the named executive officers pursuant to an employment agreement or other plans or individual award agreements in the event of the named executive officer's termination of employment under the circumstances described below, assuming such termination took place on December 31, 2018. 
Actual values would reflect specific circumstances at the time of any termination, the plans and provisions effective if and when a termination event occurs and any other applicable factors. Certain of the named executive officers, including Messrs. Petterson and Simonelli, are also eligible for certain payments and benefits in the event of a termination of employment due to voluntary retirement. 
Payment of enhanced benefits is conditioned upon the executive's execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company and its related entities. In addition to the release, for those executives with employment agreements, the executive must uphold certain restrictive covenants, including confidentiality of information, non-competition and non-solicitation. 
The Petterson Agreement – Termination Provisions 
Under Mr. Petterson's agreement, if Mr. Petterson's employment is terminated by the Company for "Cause" (defined below) or by Mr. Petterson other than for "Good Reason" (defined below), Mr. Petterson will be entitled to his base salary and employee benefits through the termination date. 
Under Mr. Petterson's agreement, if Mr. Petterson's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or Mr. Petterson's leaves for good reason, he will be entitled to his base salary and employee benefits through the termination date, and also receive (i) 12 months of his base pay and target annual incentive compensation amount, less applicable withholdings, payable according to the Company's scheduled payroll pay dates; (ii) the pro rata portion of his annual incentive compensation and the Supplemental Savings Plan benefits earned through the termination date, paid at the same time as continuing executives; (iii) 12 months of subsidized medical and dental coverage for Mr. Petterson, his wife, and eligible dependents (to the extent each have been provided with coverage on the date immediately prior to the termination date); and (iv) 18 months of vesting credit for any unvested equity awards, provided that Mr. Petterson has been employed by the Company as its Chief Executive Officer for at least two consecutive years as of the termination date. 
If within 24 months of a "Change in Control," the Company terminates the employment of Mr. Petterson other than for cause or if Mr. Petterson voluntarily resigns his employment for good reason, the Company will pay Mr. Petterson, in lieu of any cash severance payment, a change in control payment equal to: (i) two times the sum of his then current base salary plus the average of his target annual incentive over the three year period immediately preceding his termination; and (ii) the pro rata portion of his annual incentive and Supplemental Savings Plan benefits earned through the termination date. In the event of such a termination, Mr. Petterson is also entitled to continued coverage under the Company's health plans for up to 24 months following the termination date and full vesting of any outstanding unvested equity awards. 
If the Company elects not to renew the employment agreement for Mr. Petterson prior to the fourth anniversary of the employment agreement, then Mr. Petterson will receive full vesting of any unvested equity awards irrespective of whether his employment is subsequently terminated. If the Company elects not to renew the employment agreement for Mr. Petterson during any renewal term and, within 12 months of the end of the renewal term, terminates Mr. Petterson's employment without cause or Mr. Petterson voluntarily resigns his employment for good reason, then Mr. Petterson will receive full vesting of any unvested equity awards. 
If Mr. Petterson retires after serving as Chief Executive Officer for at least six consecutive years, provides the Board with at least 12 months written advance notice of his intent to retire, and remains employed by the Company for at least 12 months after providing such notice, Mr. Petterson will receive full vesting of any of his outstanding equity awards as of the termination date; and Mr. Petterson will not be entitled to, and will be ineligible to receive, any new equity awards following the date on which Mr. Petterson notifies the Board of his retirement. 
For purposes of Mr. Petterson's agreement: 
"Cause" means: (a) a material breach of the agreement or an established policy of the Company; (b) an act constituting a felony or engagement in unethical or immoral conduct that, in the reasonable judgment of the Board, could injure the integrity, character or reputation of the Company; (c) failure, refusal or inability to perform or habitual neglect of duties and responsibilities following written notice and opportunity to cure; (d) an act of material dishonesty, misconduct or fraud or violation of a fiduciary duty; or (e) failure to reasonably cooperate with any audit or investigation following written notice and opportunity to cure.

Mr. Petterson's employment agreement does not provide for the continuance of any compensation or benefit obligations upon death or disability; however, pursuant to Mr. Petterson's restricted stock unit award agreements, Mr. Petterson would receive full vesting of any unvested equity awards under such circumstances.

The Marinko, Shea and LaVoy Agreements – Termination Provisions 
Our employment agreements with each of Mr. Marinko, Mr. Shea and Ms. LaVoy have similar termination provisions. Under each executive's agreement, if the executive's employment is terminated by the Company for "Cause" (defined below) or by the executive other than for "Good Reason" (defined below), the executive will be entitled to the executive's base salary and employee benefits through the termination date. 
Under each executive's agreement, if the executive is terminated by the Company without cause or the executive leaves for good reason, the executive will receive (i) continuation of base pay during a specified severance period (18 months for Mr. Marinko, 12 months for Mr. Shea and 15 months for Ms. LaVoy), in each case, less applicable withholdings, payable according to the Company's scheduled payroll pay dates; (ii) for Messrs. Marinko and Shea, a multiple of the average of the executive's actual annual incentive and Supplemental Savings Plan benefits over the preceding three years (one and one-half times for Mr. Marinko and one times for Mr. Shea), paid at the same time as continuing executives; (iii) for Mr. Marinko, the pro rata portion of his annual incentive at target; (iv) subsidized medical and dental coverage during the severance period; (v) vesting credit equal to the number of months in the severance period for any unvested equity awards; and (vi) for Ms. LaVoy, payment of outplacement services of up to $15,000, provided such services are rendered within one year of termination. 
If the executive is terminated without cause within 12 months (or 18 months for Mr. Shea) after a "Change in Control", the executive will receive (i) a multiple of the sum of the executive's annual base pay plus the average of the executive's actual annual incentive over the preceding three-year period (two times for Messrs. Marinko and Shea and 1.25 times for Ms. LaVoy), less applicable withholdings, payable in a lump sum; (ii) the pro rata portion of the executive's annual target incentive earned through the termination date for the year of termination; (iii) for Messrs.

CEO PAY RATIO 
Background  
Pursuant to Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Form and Consumer Protection Act, and in accordance with the adoption of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, the SEC requires the disclosure of our Chief Executive Officer to median employee pay ratio beginning with our 2018 proxy statement. 
To understand this disclosure, we think it is important to give context to our operations. Our corporate headquarters are located in Oak Brook, Illinois, and we operate dredges, vessels and ancillary equipment to perform dredging projects domestically and internationally, and also environmental and infrastructure projects domestically. As a global organization, approximately 10.4% of our employees are located outside of the United States. We strive to create a global compensation program, which is competitive in terms of both the position and the geographic location in which the employee is located. Accordingly, our pay structures vary amongst employees based on position and geographic location. 
Identification of Median Employee  
We selected December 31, 2018 as the date on which to determine our median employee. As of that date, we had approximately 1,362 employees. For purposes of identifying the median employee, we considered all domestic employees and international employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. 
We identified the median employee by examining the 2018 total wages and incentives less non-taxable compensation for all individuals, excluding our CEO, who were employed by the Company on December 31, 2018, the last day of the Company's fiscal year. To provide a more uniform comparison between domestic and international employees, we excluded from the consistently applied compensation measure allowances for housing, subsistence, safety bonuses, and transportation provided for employees working in the Middle East. Compensation paid in foreign currencies was converted to U.S. dollars based on exchange rates in effect on December 31, 2018. 
Other than as described above, we did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to compensation, and we did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by the Company for all of 2018. In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, we calculated such employee's compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K as required pursuant to SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. This calculation is the same 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table on page 34 with respect to each of the named executive officers. 
Ratio 
For fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, other than Mr. Petterson, was $88,808.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Mr. Pettersons annual total compensation was $3,252,317.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Petterson to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is estimated to be 37 to 1. Given the different methodologies that various public companies will use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies. 
PROPOSAL NO. 3 – ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Board of Directors provides stockholders with the opportunity to cast an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives you the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our fiscal year 2018 executive compensation program and policies for the named executive officers, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corporation approve, on an advisory basis,  the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the tabular disclosure regarding such compensation, and the accompanying narrative disclosure, set forth in the  Company's 2019 Annual Meeting proxy statement.     
[END TABLE]
The advisory vote on executive compensation is not a vote on our general compensation policies, compensation of our Board of Directors or our compensation policies as they relate to risk management. 
We are required to hold the advisory vote on executive compensation at least once every three years. At the Company's 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, a majority of the shares cast voted, on an advisory basis, to hold future advisory votes on executive compensation on an annual basis. After consideration of the voting results, the Company's Board of Directors determined that the Company will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation each year until the next required stockholder advisory vote on frequency of executive compensation occurs or until the Board of Directors otherwise determines that a different frequency for advisory votes on executive compensation is in the best interests of stockholders. 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executive officers who are able to achieve short term and long-term corporate objectives and create stockholder value. The Compensation Committee believes our executive compensation programs reflect a strong pay-for-performance philosophy and are well aligned with our stockholders' long-term interests. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board believe our executive compensation programs are effective at incentivizing the achievement of outstanding financial performance and superior returns to stockholders. We believe that our commitment to align executive compensation with Company performance and stockholder interests is exhibited by the Company's executive compensation decisions during the last 12 months. For example, under our Executive Leadership Annual Incentive Program, annual incentive pools are funded based on our Company Adjusted EBITDA. These annual incentive pools are allocated to individuals based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of individual performance achievements. In addition, the Compensation Committee grants performance–based restricted stock units to certain executives that are only earned upon achievement of performance goals. Because these performance goals were not achieved, performance–based restricted stock units granted in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 were forfeited. In 2018, the Company performance was extraordinary and, as a result, the performance–based restricted stock units based on 2018 financial performance earned at the maximum level. 
Stockholders are urged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement which more thoroughly discusses how our executive compensation policies and procedures implement our executive compensation philosophy. 
Although the annual advisory stockholder vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the Compensation Committee has considered, and will continue to consider, the outcome of the vote each year when making executive compensation decisions for our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee, which is comprised of independent directors, values constructive dialogue with our stockholders on executive compensation and other important governance topics and encourages all stockholders to vote their shares on this matter. At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 59% of the stockholders who voted on the "say-on-pay" proposal voted in favor of the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee believes that this vote affirms stockholders' support of the Company's approach to executive compensation. Both the Board and Compensation Committee expect to take into account the outcome of this year's vote when considering future executive compensation decisions to the extent they can determine the cause or causes of any significant negative voting results. 
VOTE REQUIRED AND RECOMMENDATION 
Adoption of this resolution will require the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon, assuming a quorum is present. Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the matter, and therefore, will have the effect of a vote against the proposed resolution.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures. All interested transactions with related parties are subject to our Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures, which are set forth in writing (the "Related Party Transaction Policy"). The Audit Committee is responsible for applying the Related Party Transaction Policy. For purposes of the Related Party Transaction Policy, the terms "interested transaction" and "related parties" are defined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● interested transaction means any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of  similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $100,000 in any calendar year;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  we are a participant; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest, other than solely as a result of being a  director or a less than ten percent (10%) beneficial owner of another entity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● related party means any:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  person who is or was, since the beginning of the last fiscal year for which we have filed a Form 10-K and proxy statement, even if they do not presently serve in that role, an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  greater than five percent (5%) beneficial owner of our common stock; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  o  immediate family member of any of the foregoing. Immediate family member includes a person's spouse,  parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mothers- and fathers-in-law, sons- and  daughters-in-law, and brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone residing in such  person's home (other than a tenant or employee).  
[END TABLE]
In determining the propriety of an interested transaction with a related party, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems important, whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. 
Our Board has delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee the authority to pre-approve or ratify (as applicable) any interested transaction with a related party in which the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than $500,000. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the following types of transactions and determined that each such type of transaction shall be deemed to be pre-approved or ratified under the terms of the Related Party Transaction Policy:

INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Shares Entitled to Vote 
Only stockholders of record of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at the close of business on the record date will be entitled to vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting. As of the record date, there were a total of 63,182,859 shares of our common stock outstanding, each share being entitled to one vote. There is no cumulative voting. 
Quorum Requirement 
The presence at the 2019 Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. If a quorum is not present or represented at the Annual Meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will have the power to adjourn the Annual Meeting without notice, other than the announcement at the Annual Meeting of such adjournment, until a quorum shall be present or represented. 
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, in order to ensure the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting, please vote your shares in accordance with the instructions described below. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Shares owned by Great Lakes are not voted and do not count for quorum purposes. 
Beneficial Owners 
If you are the registered holder of shares, then you are the record holder of those shares, and you should vote your shares as described in the next section. 
If you own shares through a broker, the registered holder of those shares is the broker or its nominee. Such shares are often referred to as being held in "street name," and you, as the beneficial owner of those shares, do not appear in our stock register. For street name shares, there is a two-step process for distributing our proxy materials and tabulating votes. Brokers inform us how many of their clients own common stock in street name, and the broker forwards our proxy materials to those beneficial owners. If you receive our proxy materials from your broker, including a voting instruction form, you should vote your shares by following the procedures specified on the voting instruction form. Shortly before the Annual Meeting, your broker will tabulate the votes it has received and submit a proxy card to us reflecting the aggregate votes of the street name holders. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting and vote your street name shares in person, you should contact your broker to obtain a broker's proxy card and bring it to the Annual Meeting. 
Discretionary Voting by Brokers 
Under current rules governing registered brokers, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote, your broker will have discretionary voting power for ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2), but would not have discretionary voting power for the election of directors (Proposal 1) or the advisory vote on executive compensation (Proposal 3). 
How to Vote     
You can vote at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. We recommend that you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. You can always attend the Annual Meeting and revoke your proxy by voting in person. 
There are three ways to vote by proxy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by telephone  You can vote by touch-tone telephone by calling toll-free 1-800-690-6903 and following the instructions on our proxy card or the Notice;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by internet  You can vote by Internet by going to the website www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions on our proxy card or the Notice; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by mail  If you have requested or receive paper copies of our proxy  materials by mail, you can vote by mail by completing, signing, dating and mailing our enclosed proxy card in the pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Votes submitted by telephone or electronically over the internet must be received by 11:59 P.M., Central Daylight Time, on May 1, 2019. 
By giving us your proxy, you are authorizing the individuals named on our proxy card, the proxies, to vote your shares in the manner you indicate. You may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● vote for the election of our director nominees; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● withhold authority to vote for our director nominees.  
[END TABLE]
You may vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, and the approval of the non-binding resolution to approve the Company's executive compensation. 
Votes by Proxy 
All shares that have been properly voted by proxy and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy. Shares represented by proxy cards that are signed and returned but do not contain any voting instructions will be voted consistent with the Board's recommendations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● (Proposal 1) FOR the election of all director nominees named in the  Proxy Statement;                  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● (Proposal 2) FOR the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP  as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● (Proposal 3) FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the  Companys executive compensation; and                  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In the discretion of the proxy holders, on such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
How to Revoke Your Vote 
A stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by giving to our Corporate Secretary a written notice of revocation of the  proxys authority, such notice to be delivered to our principal executive office;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by attending the 2019 Annual Meeting and voting in person.

[BEGIN TABLE]
● by calling toll-free 1-800-690-6903; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● by visitng the website  www.proxyvote.com.  
[END TABLE]
Vote Necessary to Approve Proposals 
Proposal 1: The nominees for director for a three-year term will be elected provided that they receive the affirmative vote of a plurality of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. This means that, if a quorum is present, the three persons receiving the greatest numbers of votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected to serve as directors. Withholding authority to vote for a director nominee will not affect the outcome of the election of directors. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors. 
Proposal 2: Deloitte & Touche LLP will be ratified as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, provided the proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, will have the effect of votes against the proposal. 
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Proposal 3: The advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers will be approved provided the proposal receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will be treated as being present and entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, will have the effect of votes against the proposed resolution. A broker non-vote is treated as not being entitled to vote on the matter and, therefore, is not counted for purposes of determining whether the proposal has been approved. Although the outcome of this advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and our Board will review and consider the outcome of this vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. 
OTHER MATTERS 
Other Business at the Annual Meeting 
The Board of Directors knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
Proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
Pursuant to federal securities laws, any proposal by a stockholder proposed to be included in our proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received at our principal executive office at 2122 York Road, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523, no later than November 22, 2019. Proposals should be sent to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office. Pursuant to our Bylaws, in order for a stockholder's nominee for election as a director or any other business to be properly brought before an Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholder must give written notice of such stockholder's intent to bring a matter before the Annual Meeting no earlier than November 22, 2019, and no later than December 22, 2019. If the 2020 Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within 30 days of the anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting, written notice of such stockholder's intent to bring a matter before the Annual Meeting must be received not earlier than 120 days prior to such Annual Meeting date and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such Annual Meeting date or the tenth day following the date on which the first public disclosure of the date of the Annual Meeting is made. Each such notice should be sent to the attention of our Corporate Secretary at our principal executive office, and must set forth certain information with respect to the stockholder who intends to bring such matter before the meeting and the business desired to be conducted, as set forth in greater detail in our Bylaws. 
Householding of Proxy Materials 
Some banks, brokers, and other record holders may be participating in the practice of "householding" proxy statements and annual reports. This means that only one Notice, or if you requested paper copies, one copy of our Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K may have been sent to multiple stockholders in your household. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of these documents to you if you contact the Broadridge Householding Department at the following address: 
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. 
Householding Department 
51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717 
1-800-542-1061 
If you want to receive separate copies of Notices of Internet Availability, or paper copies of our proxy statements and annual reports on Form 10-K in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy for your household, you should contact your bank, broker, or other record holder, or you may contact Broadridge at the address and phone number shown. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
We will bear the costs and expenses of preparing and mailing proxy solicitation materials for the Annual Meeting and will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy solicitation materials to stockholders. We have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies at an anticipated approximate cost of $12,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. Proxies may also be solicited in person, by telephone, or by facsimile by our directors, officers and employees without additional compensation being paid to these persons.

APPENDIX A 
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP MEASURES 
We report our financial results in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). We use certain non-GAAP financial measures as part of our compensation program, including Adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and EBT, all excluding restructuring. Restructuring items can include costs of contract revenues (depreciation and other), general and administrative expenses and gains / losses on sale of assets. 
In our Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") on page 23, we include information regarding notable financial achievements in 2018, including a non-GAAP measure, Adjusted EBITDA from Continuing Operations (excluding restructuring). We provide below a reconciliation for this 2018 measure. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is a measure frequently used to evaluate performance of companies with substantial leverage and that the Company's primary stakeholders (i.e., its stockholders, bondholders and banks) use Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to evaluate the Company's period to period performance. 
In our CD&A on page 31, we include our performance targets based on 2018 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted EBT as compared to our 2018 financial results for those measures. We also provide information regarding the extent to which the targets set in 2018 for each of these measures differed from 2017 performance for each of these measures. We provide below a reconciliation for each of those 2017 measures. 
We use non-GAAP performance measures in our compensation program because we believe growth in these measures is important to the Company's short and long-term success. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitution for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies.
