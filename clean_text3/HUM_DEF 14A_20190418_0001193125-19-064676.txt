           (Top Photo: Kurt  Hilzinger; Bottom Photo: Bruce Broussard)   Total Stockholder Return          Returned to Stockholders          Dear Fellow Stockholders:   We would like to invite you to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Humana Inc., to be held on Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, at the  Company's headquarters, located at 500 West Main Street, 25th Floor Auditorium, in Louisville, Kentucky. The meeting will also be webcast via the Internet at the Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.humana.com.  This proxy statement contains information about our Company and the four proposals to be voted upon by stockholders at the meeting. Please give this information your careful attention.   This year, we will once again be taking advantage of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules  that allow us to furnish proxy materials to our stockholders on the Internet. These materials will be available on the Internet on or about March 6, 2019. We continue to believe that Internet delivery of our proxy materials allows us to provide  our stockholders with the information they need, while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting.   We hope you can attend the meeting. However, even if you are unable to join us, we urge you to still exercise your right as a stockholder and vote by telephone, mail or  using the Internet. The vote of every stockholder is important.   This proxy statement is being  mailed or transmitted on or about March 6, 2019, to our stockholders of record as of February 25, 2019.   2018 Summary   Humana had a strong year of growth and success in 2018. We're proud of the way we executed our plan and delivered positive results in all areas of the business.  Fueled by strong Medicare Advantage results and the success of our integrated care delivery model, we reported earnings per diluted common share (EPS) of $12.16 and Adjusted EPS of $14.55*, growth  of over 24% compared to Adjusted EPS of $11.71 in 2017. Strong Medicare Advantage membership growth during 2018 and the company's transition to providing healthcare services to military service members, retirees, and their families under the  new TRICARE East Region contract led to growing our membership base by over 18%, reaching 16.6 million members at year-end. Despite our exiting the individual commercial business as of January 1,  2018, we reported revenues of $56.91 billion in 2018 exceeding revenues of $53.77 billion in 2017, backed again by the strong growth of our Medicare Advantage business. As we move into 2019, we intend to continue advancing our consumer and  health-focused strategy, recognizing the importance of being on the leading edge of value-based care.   We're excited about our opportunity to improve the lives of the millions of people we serve while helping lead the way in transforming the future of our industry. We  owe our success, in no small part, to our employees, members, clinical and governmental partners and shareholders. We especially want to thank our approximately 42,000 employees for their dedication, commitment and skill in serving our members.  We're proud to enter 2019 with employee engagement at an all-time high in the 92nd percentile, representing world-class engagement. Our thanks also  goes out to our members for choosing and entrusting us to serve their most important and personal needs – their health. We would also like to thank our clinical and governmental partners for their collective commitment in working with us to  improve population health through actions that put healthcare consumers first, resulting in better outcomes and reduced costs. And finally, we'd like to thank you, our shareholders. Thanks for your commitment to our organization and for  believing in our mission.   Sincerely,

We're proud of the way we executed our plan and delivered positive results in all areas of the business.  Fueled by strong Medicare Advantage results and the success of our integrated care delivery model, we reported earnings per diluted common share (EPS) of $12.16 and Adjusted EPS of $14.55*, growth  of over 24% compared to Adjusted EPS of $11.71 in 2017. Strong Medicare Advantage membership growth during 2018 and the company's transition to providing healthcare services to military service members, retirees, and their families under the  new TRICARE East Region contract led to growing our membership base by over 18%, reaching 16.6 million members at year-end. Despite our exiting the individual commercial business as of January 1,  2018, we reported revenues of $56.91 billion in 2018 exceeding revenues of $53.77 billion in 2017, backed again by the strong growth of our Medicare Advantage business. As we move into 2019, we intend to continue advancing our consumer and  health-focused strategy, recognizing the importance of being on the leading edge of value-based care.   We're excited about our opportunity to improve the lives of the millions of people we serve while helping lead the way in transforming the future of our industry. We  owe our success, in no small part, to our employees, members, clinical and governmental partners and shareholders. We especially want to thank our approximately 42,000 employees for their dedication, commitment and skill in serving our members.  We're proud to enter 2019 with employee engagement at an all-time high in the 92nd percentile, representing world-class engagement. Our thanks also  goes out to our members for choosing and entrusting us to serve their most important and personal needs – their health. We would also like to thank our clinical and governmental partners for their collective commitment in working with us to  improve population health through actions that put healthcare consumers first, resulting in better outcomes and reduced costs. And finally, we'd like to thank you, our shareholders. Thanks for your commitment to our organization and for  believing in our mission.   Sincerely,

           (Top Photo: Kurt  Hilzinger; Bottom Photo: Bruce Broussard)   Total Stockholder Return          Returned to Stockholders          Dear Fellow Stockholders:   We would like to invite you to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Humana Inc., to be held on Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, at the  Company's headquarters, located at 500 West Main Street, 25th Floor Auditorium, in Louisville, Kentucky. The meeting will also be webcast via the Internet at the Investor Relations section of the Company's website, www.humana.com.  This proxy statement contains information about our Company and the four proposals to be voted upon by stockholders at the meeting. Please give this information your careful attention.   This year, we will once again be taking advantage of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules  that allow us to furnish proxy materials to our stockholders on the Internet. These materials will be available on the Internet on or about March 6, 2019. We continue to believe that Internet delivery of our proxy materials allows us to provide  our stockholders with the information they need, while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting.   We hope you can attend the meeting. However, even if you are unable to join us, we urge you to still exercise your right as a stockholder and vote by telephone, mail or  using the Internet. The vote of every stockholder is important.   This proxy statement is being  mailed or transmitted on or about March 6, 2019, to our stockholders of record as of February 25, 2019.   2018 Summary   Humana had a strong year of growth and success in 2018. We're proud of the way we executed our plan and delivered positive results in all areas of the business.  Fueled by strong Medicare Advantage results and the success of our integrated care delivery model, we reported earnings per diluted common share (EPS) of $12.16 and Adjusted EPS of $14.55*, growth  of over 24% compared to Adjusted EPS of $11.71 in 2017. Strong Medicare Advantage membership growth during 2018 and the company's transition to providing healthcare services to military service members, retirees, and their families under the  new TRICARE East Region contract led to growing our membership base by over 18%, reaching 16.6 million members at year-end. Despite our exiting the individual commercial business as of January 1,  2018, we reported revenues of $56.91 billion in 2018 exceeding revenues of $53.77 billion in 2017, backed again by the strong growth of our Medicare Advantage business. As we move into 2019, we intend to continue advancing our consumer and  health-focused strategy, recognizing the importance of being on the leading edge of value-based care.   We're excited about our opportunity to improve the lives of the millions of people we serve while helping lead the way in transforming the future of our industry. We  owe our success, in no small part, to our employees, members, clinical and governmental partners and shareholders. We especially want to thank our approximately 42,000 employees for their dedication, commitment and skill in serving our members.  We're proud to enter 2019 with employee engagement at an all-time high in the 92nd percentile, representing world-class engagement. Our thanks also  goes out to our members for choosing and entrusting us to serve their most important and personal needs – their health. We would also like to thank our clinical and governmental partners for their collective commitment in working with us to  improve population health through actions that put healthcare consumers first, resulting in better outcomes and reduced costs. And finally, we'd like to thank you, our shareholders. Thanks for your commitment to our organization and for  believing in our mission.   Sincerely,

Frequently Asked Questions 
Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement? 
You are receiving a proxy statement because you owned shares of Humana common stock as of Monday, February 25, 2019, which we refer to as the Record Date, and that entitles you to vote at the Annual Meeting. Our Board of Directors has made these materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the Board's solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Company for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Your proxy will authorize specified people (proxies) to vote on your behalf at the Annual Meeting. By use of a proxy, you can vote, whether or not you attend the meeting. 
This proxy statement describes the matters on which the Company would like you to vote, provides information on those matters, and provides information about the Company that we must disclose when we solicit your proxy. 
Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet. We believe that Internet delivery of our proxy materials allows us to provide our stockholders with the information they need, while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, which we refer to as the Notice, to our stockholders and beneficial owners as of the Record Date. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on a website referred to in the Notice or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found on the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail on an ongoing basis by calling Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., or Broadridge, at 1-800-579-1639. 
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
The Notice provides you with instructions regarding how to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• View our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Instruct us to send our future proxy materials to you electronically by e-mail.  
[END TABLE]
Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by e-mail will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our Annual Meetings on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by e-mail, you will receive an e-mail next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it. 
When and where is the Annual Meeting? 
The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, April 18, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., Eastern Time, at the Company's headquarters, located at 500 West Main Street, 25th Floor Auditorium, in Louisville, Kentucky. 
Who is entitled to vote?

What if my Shares are not registered in my name?

In addition, stockholders may request, by calling Broadridge at 1-800-579-1639, to receive proxy materials in printed form, by mail or electronically by e-mail, on an ongoing basis. When you own your Shares in street name, you are deemed a beneficial owner or holder for voting purposes. 
If you hold Shares through an account with a bank, broker or other nominee and you do not provide voting instructions on your instruction form, your Shares may not be voted by the nominee with respect to certain proposals, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the election of directors;  
[END TABLE]

Banks, brokers and other nominees have the authority under the regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, to vote shares for which their customers do not provide voting instructions only on certain "routine" matters, including the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. However, the proposals listed above are not considered "routine" matters for this purpose, and therefore your Shares will not be voted with respect to such proposals if you do not provide voting instructions on your instruction form. 
How many votes are required to approve each proposal, what are the effects of abstentions and unmarked proxy cards, and is broker discretionary voting allowed?

(2)  If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker or other NYSE member organization, you must  instruct the broker how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." A broker non-vote will not affect the outcome of the vote for the matters being presented for action at the Annual Meeting, because they are not considered to  be votes cast.  
[END TABLE]
What is a "broker non-vote"? 
A broker "non-vote" occurs when a broker or other NYSE member organization holding Shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner, but does have discretionary voting power over other items and submits votes for those matters. As discussed above, if you hold Shares through a broker or other NYSE member organization and do not provide voting instructions to your broker or other NYSE member organization, your Shares may not be voted with respect to certain proposals, including the proposals listed above that are not considered routine. 
What is a "quorum"? 
A "quorum" is a majority of the outstanding Shares. Shares may be voted at the Annual Meeting by a signed proxy card, by telephone instruction, or electronically on the Internet. There must be a quorum for the Annual Meeting to be held. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.

How do I vote? 
There are four ways that you can vote your Shares. Voting by any of these methods will supersede any prior vote you made regardless of how that vote was made. PLEASE CHOOSE ONLY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1)  By Internet.   The website for voting is http: //www.ProxyVote.com. In order to vote on the Internet, you  need the control number on your proxy card. Each stockholder has a unique control number so we can ensure all voting instructions are genuine and prevent duplicate voting. The Internet voting system is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week,  until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday, April 17, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting. Once you are logged on the Internet voting system, you can record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions. If you use the Internet  voting system, you do not need to return your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2)  By telephone.   If you are a registered holder in the United States or Canada, you may call 1-800-690-6903. The telephone voting system is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on  Wednesday, April 17, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting. In order to vote by telephone, you need the control number on your proxy card. Each stockholder has a unique control number so we can ensure all voting instructions are genuine and  prevent duplicate voting. Once you are logged on the telephone voting system, a series of prompts will tell you how to record and confirm (or change) your voting instructions. If you use the telephone voting system, you do not need to return your  proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3)  By mail.   Mark your voting instructions, sign and date the proxy card and then return it in the  postage-paid envelope provided. If you mail your proxy card, we must receive it before 12:00 p.m., Eastern Time, on Friday, April 12, 2019. If you are returning your proxy card to Broadridge, they must receive it before 10:00 a.m., Eastern  Time, on Wednesday, April 17, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4)  In person.   Attend the Annual Meeting. Mark your voting instructions and deliver to the Inspectors of  Election. However, you can vote by methods 1, 2 or 3 above prior to the meeting and still attend the Annual Meeting. In all cases, a vote at the Annual Meeting will revoke any prior votes. Please note that if your Shares are held through a bank,  broker or other nominee, you will need to bring proof of ownership to the Annual Meeting in order to vote.  
[END TABLE]
How do I vote the share equivalent units held in the Humana Common Stock Fund of the Humana Retirement Savings Plan or the Humana Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan? 
If you have an interest in the Humana Common Stock Fund of the Humana Retirement Savings Plan or the Humana Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan on the Record Date, you may vote. Under the Humana Retirement Savings Plan and the Humana Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan, your voting rights are based on your interest, or the amount of money you and the Company have invested in your Humana Common Stock Fund. 
You may exercise these voting rights in almost the same way that stockholders may vote their Shares, but you have an earlier deadline, and you should provide your voting instructions to Broadridge. Broadridge will aggregate the votes of all participants and provide voting information to the Trustee for the applicable plan. If your voting instructions are received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on Wednesday, April 10, 2019, the Trustee will submit a proxy that reflects your instructions. If you do not give voting instructions (or give them later than that time), the Trustee will vote your interest in the Humana Common Stock Fund in the same proportion as the Shares attributed to the Humana Retirement Savings Plan, or the Humana Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan, as applicable, are actually voted by the other participants in the applicable plan. 
You must provide your instructions to Broadridge by using the Internet, registered holder telephone number (1-800-690-6903) or mail methods described above. Please note that you cannot vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Your voting instructions will be kept confidential under the terms of the Humana Retirement Savings Plan or the Humana Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan, as applicable. 
Who will count the votes? 
Broadridge will tabulate the votes cast by proxy, whether by proxy card, Internet or telephone. Additionally, the Company's Inspectors of Election will tabulate the votes cast at the Annual Meeting together with the votes cast by proxy. 
How do I revoke my proxy? 
You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the Annual Meeting. 
Your method of doing so will depend upon how you originally voted (a later vote will supersede any prior vote you made regardless of how that vote was made): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1)  By Internet — simply log in and resubmit your vote — Broadridge will only count the last instructions;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2)  By Telephone — simply sign in and resubmit your vote — Broadridge will only count the last instructions;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3)  By Mail — you must give written notice of revocation to Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717 or by fax at 1-515-254-7733, submit another properly signed proxy with a more recent date, or vote in person at the Annual Meeting. For written and  fax notices, you must include the control number that is printed on the upper portion of your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
What is the due date for stockholder proposals, including stockholder nominees for director, for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting? 
Stockholder proposals, or stockholder nominees for director at the 2020 Annual Meeting, as permitted by SEC regulations for inclusion in our proxy materials relating to the 2020 Annual Meeting, must be submitted to the Corporate Secretary in writing no later than November 7, 2019. Proposals should be submitted to the attention of the Corporate Secretary, Humana Inc., 500 West Main Street, 21st Floor, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. 
May a stockholder present a proposal not included in our Proxy Statement at the April 18, 2019, Annual Meeting? 
A stockholder can present a proposal at the Annual Meeting (a so-called "floor resolution") only if certain notice requirements are met. The SEC does not directly regulate meeting conduct. State law imposes only limited requirements, so meetings are governed by procedures set forth in our Bylaws. Humana's Bylaws require that a stockholder provide written notice of intent to bring a proposal no less than 60 days or more than 90 days prior to the scheduled date of the Annual Meeting of stockholders. If less than 70 days' notice of the Annual Meeting is given, written notice by a stockholder would be deemed timely if made no later than the 10th day following such notice of the Annual Meeting. A proposal must also meet other requirements as to form and content set forth in our Bylaws. Stockholder proposals should be sent to the attention of the Corporate Secretary, Humana Inc., 500 West Main Street, 21st Floor, Louisville, Kentucky 40202. A copy of our Bylaws is available on our website. From the www.humana.com website, click on "Investor Relations," and then click on "Corporate Governance," and then click on the link entitled, "Bylaws." 
How will Humana solicit votes and who pays for the solicitation? 
We have engaged D. F. King & Co., Inc. to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and solicitation of votes for approximately $12,000 plus expenses. We have also engaged Broadridge to assist in the distribution of proxy materials and the accumulation of votes through the Internet, telephone and coordination of mail votes for approximately $253,000 plus expenses. We will reimburse banks, brokers and other nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation material to our stockholders. 
How can I obtain additional information about the Company? 
Included with this proxy statement (either in printed form or on the Internet) is a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which also contains the information required in our Annual Report to Stockholders. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K and all our other filings with the SEC also may be accessed via the Investor Relations section on our website at www.humana.com. We encourage you to visit our website.

Where can I find voting results for this Annual Meeting? 
The voting results will be published in a current report on Form 8-K which will be filed with the SEC no later than four business days after the Annual Meeting. The Form 8-K will also be available on our website at www.humana.com. 
What is "householding"? 
"Householding" occurs when a single copy of our Annual Report, proxy statement and Notice is sent to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. Although we do not "household" for registered stockholders, a number of brokerage firms have instituted householding for Shares held in street name. This procedure reduces our printing and mailing costs and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards, and householding will not affect the mailing of account statements or special notices in any way. If you wish to receive separate copies of our Annual Report, proxy statement or Notice in the future, please contact the bank, broker or other nominee through which you hold your Shares. 
Company Overview 
Headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, Humana Inc. is a leading (Fortune rank #56) health and well-being company focused on making it easy for people to achieve their best health with clinical excellence through coordinated care. Our strategy integrates care delivery, the member experience, and clinical and consumer insights to encourage engagement, behavior change, proactive clinical outreach and wellness for the millions of people we serve across the country. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 16.6 million members in our medical benefit plans, as well as approximately 6.1 million members in our specialty products. 
Our Strategy 
We are committed to helping our millions of medical and specialty members achieve their best health. Our successful history in care delivery and health plan administration is helping us create a new kind of integrated care with the power to improve health and well-being and lower costs. Our efforts are leading to a better quality of life for people with Medicare, families, individuals, military service personnel, and communities at large. To accomplish that, we support physicians and other health care professionals as they work to deliver the right care in the right place for their patients, our members. Our range of clinical capabilities, resources and tools — such as in-home care, behavioral health, pharmacy services, data analytics and wellness solutions — combine to produce a simplified experience that makes health care easier to navigate and more effective. 
Humana's innovative strategy continues to capitalize on industry changes which continue to progress toward our goals of making benefits more affordable while improving the overall cost of care and consumer experience — through our integrated care delivery model. We understand that healthcare is complicated, and dealing with multiple physicians and other healthcare professionals can be a confusing and daunting task. That is one of the principal reasons why Humana continues to enhance its integrated care delivery strategy in key areas to enable a better and more seamless locally delivered health care experience for our members. 
One of the areas in which we strive to improve is the health of seniors living with chronic conditions. Our integrated care delivery model brings simplicity and connectivity to the healthcare experience of our senior members. We thrive in this area by (i) partnering with providers to evolve incentives from treating health episodically to managing health holistically; (ii) integrating clinical programs that intersect healthcare and lifestyle- helping people at key moments of need; and (iii) by simplifying processes through leveraging technology, consumer segmentation and analytics. 
We offer insurance and non-insurance products to consumers through our various subsidiaries. Our medical and specialty insurance products allow members to access health care services primarily through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted. In addition, we offer services to our health plan members as well as to third parties including pharmacy solutions, provider services, and clinical programs, such as home health and other services and capabilities to promote wellness and advance population health. At the core of our strategy is our integrated care delivery model, which unites quality care, high member engagement, and sophisticated data analytics. Three core elements of the model are to improve the consumer experience by simplifying the interaction with us, engaging members in clinical programs, and offering assistance to providers in transitioning from a fee-for-service to a value-based arrangement. Our approach to primary, physician-directed care for our members aims to provide quality care that is consistent, integrated, cost-effective, and member-focused. The model is designed to improve health outcomes and affordability for individuals and for the health system as a whole, while offering our members a simple, seamless healthcare experience. 
Our Performance 
With significant progress made on our strategic initiatives, 2018 was an extremely successful year during which we returned strong financial performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We reported diluted earnings per common share (EPS) of $12.16 and adjusted EPS of $14.55*, exceeding our initial Adjusted  EPS guidance of $13.50 to $14.00, as we increased our public adjusted earnings estimate four times over the course of the year as a result of strong performance across our operating segments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our 2018 earnings outperformance was fueled by continued strong Medicare Advantage results.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We returned over $1.3 billion to our stockholders in the form of share repurchases and in dividends, and also increased  our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share from $0.40 per share (with a further ten percent increase to $0.55 per share in February 2019).

Corporate Governance 
Humana is committed to having sound corporate governance principles and operates within a comprehensive plan of corporate governance for the purpose of defining responsibilities, setting high standards of professional and personal conduct, and assuring compliance with such responsibilities and standards. Sound corporate governance is essential to running our business effectively and to maintaining our reputation of integrity in the marketplace. At the heart of these efforts lie our company values, the guiding forces behind all our actions — Inspire Health, Cultivate Uniqueness, Rethink Routine, Pioneer Simplicity, and Thrive Together. Our Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which we refer to as the Guidelines, intended to comply with the requirements of Section 303A.09 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Guidelines may be viewed on our website at www.humana.com. From the www.humana.com website, click on "Investor Relations," then click on "Corporate Governance," and then click on the link entitled "Corporate Governance Guidelines." 
Role of the Board and Board Leadership 
Role of the Board 
The business of the Company is managed under the direction of the Board, whose members are elected annually by the Company's stockholders. The basic responsibility of the Board is to lead the Company by exercising its business judgment to act in what each director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of Humana and its stockholders, while engaging in active and independent oversight of the management of the Company's business affairs and assets. In order to fulfill its responsibilities to the Company's stockholders, the Board, both directly and through its committees, regularly engages with management, ensures management accountability and reviews the most critical issues that face the Company, such as approval of the Company's strategy and mission, execution of the Company's financial and strategic goals, oversight of risk management, succession planning, and determination of executive compensation. 
Board Oversight of Risk 
While management is responsible for designing and implementing the Company's risk management process, controls and oversight, the Board, both as a whole and through its committees, has overall responsibility for oversight of the Company's risk management. The full Board regularly reviews risks that may be material to the Company, including those detailed in the Audit Committee's reports and as disclosed in the Company's quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC.

[END TABLE]
The goal of these processes is to achieve serious and thoughtful board-level attention to the Company's risk management process and system, the nature of the material risks faced by the Company, and the adequacy of the Company's risk management process and system designed to respond to and mitigate these risks. 
Board Leadership 
Leadership of the Board is essential to facilitate the Board acting effectively as a working group to the benefit of the Company and its performance. As Chairman of the Board, Mr. Kurt J. Hilzinger serves as Chair of regular sessions of the Board, runs the Board process and ensures effectiveness and collaboration in all aspects of the Board's role, and leads the Board in anticipating and responding to crises. 
The Board believes that the advisability of having a separate or combined chairman and chief executive officer positions is dependent upon the strengths of the individual or individuals that hold these positions and the most effective means of leveraging these strengths, in light of the challenges and circumstances facing the Company, which may change over time. At this time, given the composition of the Company's Board, the effective interaction between Mr. Hilzinger, as Chairman, and Mr. Broussard, as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Hilzinger's status as an independent director and previous service as our Lead Director, and the current challenges faced by the Company, the Board believes that separating the chief executive officer and Board chairman positions provides the Company with the right foundation to pursue the Company's strategic and operational objectives, while maintaining effective independent oversight and objective evaluation of the performance of the Company. 
Qualifications and Process for Nominating Directors 
Identifying Nominees for Directors 
The Board has delegated an established screening process for director nominees to the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, with counsel from our Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer, and outside consultants as appropriate. The goal of the screening process is to assemble a group of potential board members with deep, varied experience, sound judgment, and commitment to the Company's success. 
The Committee receives notice of potential candidates through any of the following avenues: (i) Board self-identification; (ii) third-party recommendations; and (iii) stockholder nominations. While director nominees may be presented to the Board for consideration by the Committee through any of these methods, the Board is ultimately responsible for selecting its own members — with annual stockholder voting thereafter for a director's continued tenure on the Board. Once the Committee has compiled its group of suitable candidates and conducted appropriate diligence, it then meets with the Board to review the candidates for further consideration. 
Board Self-Identification. The Committee regularly assesses the appropriate size of the Board, the areas of expertise required to effectively contribute to the Board process, and whether any vacancies are anticipated. It also annually assesses the director qualification criteria to ensure the Board has appropriate skill composition aimed at the Company's long-term business strategy, operations, risks, thought and perspective. As a result, the Committee may recommend to the Board a need for an additional director, Board refreshment for certain requisite skills and qualifications, and/or suggest the replacement of an existing director for other credible reasons. The self-identification process may also incorporate responses, as appropriate, from the Board's annual individual self-evaluations. Such evaluations require each director to honestly reflect upon and recount their personal contributions to the Board in the prior year and to provide feedback regarding their performance, the overall Board performance and the performance of certain other key Board positions. The self-evaluations are provided to the Chairman of the Board and to the CEO for their review. 
Third-Party Recommendations. From time to time, we engage a professional third-party search firm to assist the Board of Directors and the Committee in identifying and recruiting candidates for Board membership. We have committed to requiring any third-party search firm engaged in this process to include candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity, and gender in the pool supplied to the Committee for consideration. 
Stockholder Nominees. The policy of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee is to consider properly submitted stockholder nominations for candidates for membership on the Board as described above under "Identifying Nominees for Directors." Stockholder nominations for election to the Board of Directors are governed by specific provisions in our Bylaws, a copy of which is available on our website at www.humana.com. From the www.humana.com website, click on "Investor Relations," and then click on "Corporate Governance," and then click on the link entitled, "By-Laws." The Bylaws require that a stockholder provide written notice of intent to nominate a candidate for director no less than 60 days or more than 90 days prior to the scheduled date of the Annual Meeting of stockholders. If less than 70 days' notice of the Annual Meeting is given, written notice by a stockholder would be deemed timely if made no later than the 10th day following such notice of the Annual Meeting. Any stockholder nominations proposed for consideration by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee should include, among other information required by the Bylaws, the nominee's name, qualifications for Board membership and compliance with our Director Resignation Policy discussed in this proxy statement and should be sent to: Joseph C. Ventura, Chief Legal Officer & Corporate Secretary, Humana Inc., 500 West Main Street, 21st Floor, Louisville, Kentucky 40202.

Director Qualifications 
In assessing a director nominee, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee considers the appropriate balance of experience, skills and other qualifications required for service on our Board, including (i) qualifications or characteristics that are expected and befitting of all directors, and (ii) specific skills, experience or qualifications that should be represented collectively on our Board. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain Board membership criteria that apply to all nominees recommended for a position on the Board. 
The following are core criteria that are expected of each director or nominee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independent under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and applicable New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) and, as applicable, Internal Revenue Code (IRS) independence requirements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Service on a maximum of three public company boards other than our Company;

Our director nominee screening process is designed to ensure that the Board includes members with diverse backgrounds, including race, ethnicity, gender, skills, thought, perspective and experience, such as appropriate financial and other expertise relevant to the Company's business. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee has demonstrated its commitment to board diversity by revising its charter in December 2018 to expressly state that it shall include, and require any third-party search firm that it engages to include, candidates with diversity of race, ethnicity and gender in the pool considered by the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and/or the Board for nomination to the Board. The director nominee analysis also helps to determine whether a nominee would meet the criteria for independence set forth in the Guidelines established by the Board and in accordance with independence requirements of the NYSE and the SEC. 
Our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee recognizes that our Board should represent a diverse group of experience, skills and other qualities, and as a collective group should have expertise in certain substantive areas including: corporate governance, finance/capital markets, board of directors experience, health care industry experience, CEO or other C-suite experience with significant business acumen, direct to consumer marketing, diversity, experience with complex organizations, technology/business processes, clinical practice and government relations and/or public policy and regulatory knowledge. Certain directors or director nominees may possess expertise in the designated areas however a director or director nominee need not individually possess the experience, skill or other requisite qualification in all areas. 
The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee has determined that our Board collectively satisfies all of the above core criteria, complementing each other's skills, background and perspectives to create a collection of diverse, knowledgeable and experienced directors. For a discussion of the individual experience and qualifications of our Board members, please refer to the section entitled, "Proposal One: Election of Directors" in this proxy statement. 
Board Evaluation Practices 
The Board is committed to a rigorous self-evaluation process. Through evaluation, directors review the Board's performance and their own individual contributions, including areas where the Board feels it functions effectively, and most importantly, areas where the Board can improve. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee, with participation from our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, initiates the annual Board evaluation process. Our Board, Board Committees and each individual director are evaluated annually to assess their performance. We believe that having a review process for each group helps to (i) ensure an adequate representation of requisite skills; (ii) encourage high levels of engagement from directors; and (iii) strengthen the overall effectiveness of our Board. These evaluations may be in written or oral questionnaire form and may be administered by Board members, management or third-party consultants. Results of the evaluations are shared with the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and then later discussed with the entire Board in an aggregated manner.

           Board Evaluation          
       The Board evaluation typically consists of a written questionnaire containing  qualitative scaled and open-ended questions related to the effectiveness of the Board during the prior year. The questionnaire hones in on specific areas of responsibility and critical attributes of the Board in order to solicit candid feedback from  each director. The questionnaire also seeks practical input as to what the Board is doing well, areas in which the Board could improve and any undertakings that the Board should commence or terminate. Another benefit of the questionnaire is that it  allows each board member to evaluate the effectiveness of the Chairman of the Board.

The questionnaire hones in on specific areas of responsibility and critical attributes of the Board in order to solicit candid feedback from  each director. The questionnaire also seeks practical input as to what the Board is doing well, areas in which the Board could improve and any undertakings that the Board should commence or terminate. Another benefit of the questionnaire is that it  allows each board member to evaluate the effectiveness of the Chairman of the Board.

       Director Self-Evaluation      
       The director self-evaluation requires each director to honestly reflect upon and  carefully consider his or her performance based on key characteristics that are expected of all board members. The self-evaluation also allows each director to provide additional or updated information regarding their skills and qualifications which  in turn helps the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee make future assessments and determinations regarding Board composition. The Company encourages directors to participate in continuing education programs focused on the  Company's business and industry, their Committee roles and responsibilities, as well as legal and ethical matters.

2018 Board Evaluation 
For the 2018 evaluation period the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee employed an independent third-party consulting firm to assist with the Board and Committee evaluation process. Directors were interviewed individually by firm representatives regarding individual directors, committees and the Board effectiveness in general. Following discussions with each director, the firm compiled and aggregated the comments received and then distributed a report to the Chairman of the Board and the Chairman of the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee. At subsequent meetings, the findings were presented to the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee and then shared with the full Board for review, discussion and collective action planning.

Director Independence 
The Guidelines contain independence standards to assist the Board in its determination of director independence. In addition, to qualify as independent under the Guidelines, the Board of Directors must affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship with the Company, other than as a director. 
Pursuant to the Guidelines, the Board undertakes an annual review of director independence. During this review, the Board considers transactions and relationships between each director or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including transactions or relationships that are reported under "Certain Transactions with Management and Others" in this proxy statement. As provided in the Guidelines, the purpose of this review is to determine whether any such transactions or relationships are inconsistent with a determination that a director is independent. 
In the course of this review for the current year, the Board specifically analyzed and discussed several matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  a relationship between the Company and Pfizer Inc., or Pfizer, for which Frank A. D'Amelio, one of our current  directors, serves as an executive officer; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  a relationship between the Company and The University of Texas System, an organization comprised of fourteen academic and  health institutions focused on education, research and health care, one of which, The University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School, employs Dr. Karen B. DeSalvo, one of our current directors, as a part-time faculty member; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  a relationship between the Company and National Seating and Mobility Inc., or National Seating, for which Kurt J.  Hilzinger, the Chairman of our Board, serves as a director; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  a relationship between the Company and Chrysalis Ventures, LLC, for which David A. Jones, Jr., one of our current  directors, serves as Chairman and Managing Partner, is a greater than 5% stockholder; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  a relationship between the Company and JAPC, Inc., or JAPC, which is owned by the father of Mr. Jones, Jr.; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  a relationship between the Company and ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or ANI, for which Dr. David B. Nash, one of  our directors, serves as a director; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)  relationships between the Company and certain of our health insurance customers affiliated with one of our current  directors or a relative of that director.  
[END TABLE]
Pfizer and ANI. The relationship between the Company, and each of Pfizer and ANI consists of a negotiated rebate based on the volume of prescriptions of Pfizer and ANI drugs obtained by Humana members, respectively, which volume includes claims paid by Humana for our members and the co-payments paid by our members. Payments to Humana from Pfizer or ANI result from activity with many intermediaries over whom Humana exercises no control (i.e., the providers who prescribe these medications, the distributors who sell to the retailers, and the retailers from which our members get prescriptions). In 2018, the Pfizer and ANI rebates amounted to approximately $235.6 million and $622,870, respectively, substantially all of which were passed through to our members in the form of lower premiums and/or richer benefits. 
The University of Texas System. The University of Texas System serves as a provider in our network, for which services we paid approximately $6.7 million in 2018, collectively, to certain of its health care institutions, which is an amount that is comparable to other non-affiliated vendors for the provision of similar services, is not material to the Company, and does not represent a direct or indirect material interest for Dr. DeSalvo. 
National Seating. We purchase certain medical equipment from National Seating, for which we paid approximately $5.8 million in 2018, which is an amount that is comparable to other non-affiliated vendors, is not material to the Company, and does not represent a direct or indirect material interest for Mr. Hilzinger. 
JAPC. In 2018, we provided hangar space, pilot services and maintenance for an airplane owned by JAPC, for which we were fully reimbursed by JAPC in the aggregate amount of approximately $575,411, at a rate at least as favorable to the Company as market rates. 
Health Insurance Customers. In 2018, we received health care premium payments from certain customers with whom one of our current directors or a relative of that director has a relationship. Under each such arrangement, the premiums charged and benefits provided are comparable to those extended to our other non-affiliated customers. The following relationships were included in this review: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Main Street Realty, from which we received approximately $219,815 in premium payments, and which is owned by the  father of David A. Jones, Jr.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pfizer, from which we received approximately $189,597 in premium payments, and by which Mr. D'Amelio is  employed as Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer.  
[END TABLE]
At the conclusion of its review for the current year, the Board affirmatively determined that in each case the relationship between the Company or its affiliate and each director-related entity was not material, was below the thresholds for independence prescribed by the NYSE, and did not impact the independence of any of our directors. Each director recused themselves from the independence assessment relative to himself or herself. Consistent with these considerations, and based on its review of director independence in light of the standards contained in the Guidelines, the Board determined that each member of the Board of Directors (except Mr. Broussard, as a current employee of the Company) is independent. 
Committee Membership and Attendance 
The Board of Directors has the following standing committees: Audit; Organization & Compensation; Nominating & Corporate Governance; Executive; Technology and Investment. Only directors meeting the applicable SEC and NYSE director independence standards and Internal Revenue Code "outside director" criteria may serve on the Audit Committee, the Organization & Compensation Committee, and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee. Each standing Board committee operates pursuant to a charter, which may be viewed on our website at www.humana.com.

The role of the executive officers and the outside compensation consultant in establishing executive compensation is discussed in this proxy statement under the caption "Compensation Discussion and Analysis." Other than routine administrative matters and the ability of our CEO to approve grants of equity awards subject to certain individual and annual thresholds, no executive compensation decisions are delegated to management. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Organization & Compensation Committee: (i) is or has ever been an officer or employee of the Company; or (ii) is or was, during the last fiscal year, a participant in a "related person" transaction requiring disclosure under Item 404 of the SEC's regulations (see discussion in this proxy statement under the caption "Certain Transactions with Management and Others"); or (iii) is an executive officer of another entity at which one of our executive officers serves either as a director or on its compensation committee. 
Corporate Governance Determinations 
Considering (i) the source of each director's compensation, including any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees paid by the Company; and (ii) whether each director has an affiliate relationship with the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the Company, the Board has determined that each member of the Organization & Compensation Committee at February 21, 2019, is independent, as defined by the SEC and the NYSE, and is considered to be an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Compensation Risk Determination 
In 2018, the Organization & Compensation Committee reviewed management's assessment of the risks associated with the Company's compensation practices and policies for employees, including a consideration of the counterbalance of risk-taking incentives and risk-mitigating factors in Company practices and policies. Following a review of this assessment, the Organization & Compensation Committee determined that the risks arising from the Company's compensation practices and policies are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Pursuant to its charter, the Executive Committee possesses the authority to exercise all the powers of the Board of Directors except as otherwise provided by Delaware law and our Bylaws during intervals between meetings of the Board. The Executive Committee does not have the power, to, among other things, declare a dividend, issue stock, adopt a certificate of merger or sell substantially all of the Company's business.

[END TABLE]
The Technology Committee may also assist the Audit Committee in its oversight of our information technology internal controls, cyber security, business continuity and disaster recovery programs. 
Corporate Governance Policies 
Majority Vote Policy 
Under our Bylaws, a director nominee will be elected if the number of votes cast for the nominee exceeds the number of votes cast against the nominee. In contested elections, those in which a stockholder has nominated a person for election to the Board, the voting standard is a plurality of votes cast. The Board has also adopted a policy to require the Board to nominate for election only nominees who agree that, if they are elected to the Board, they will tender an irrevocable resignation conditioned on, first, the failure to achieve the required vote for re-election at any future meeting at which they face re-election, and second, the Board's acceptance of their resignation following that election. In addition, the Board may fill director vacancies and new directorships only with candidates who agree to tender, promptly following their appointment to the Board, the same form of resignation tendered by other directors, as described above. The Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee will submit a recommendation for prompt consideration by the Board whether to accept the resignation. Any director whose resignation is under consideration will abstain from participating in any decision regarding that resignation. The Bylaws also require stockholder nominees for director election to notify the Company whether or not such nominees intend to tender the same type of resignation required of the Board's director nominees. 
Change in Director's Primary Position 
The Board has adopted a policy requiring that a director whose primary position or affiliation changes must promptly notify the Board and the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee of the change so that a determination may be made as to the value of his or her continued service on the Board. 
Director Stock Ownership Policy 
Our Board believes that directors should be stockholders and have a significant personal financial stake in the company. Consequently, the Board has adopted the following stock ownership guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each non-employee director must maintain a minimum equity ownership level of five  times the annual cash retainer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares deferred at the election of the director are considered owned for purposes of the calculation of the ownership  requirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any shares owned by a non-employee director (or shares received upon the exercise of  options or vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units, less an amount to cover the exercise price and/or current tax liabilities) must be held by the director until the minimum equity ownership level is reached and thereafter maintained.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Once the minimum equity ownership level has been achieved, any shares received upon the vesting of restricted stock or  restricted stock units, less an amount to cover current tax liabilities, must be held by the director until one year following the vesting date.  
[END TABLE]
Compliance with these guidelines is monitored by the Organization & Compensation Committee. 
Director Attendance 
The Board has developed a number of specific expectations of directors to define their responsibilities and to promote the efficient conduct of the Board's business. With respect to the level of commitment expected of directors and related attendance protocols, as part of the Guidelines, the Board formally adopted a policy that all directors should make every effort to attend all meetings of the Board and the Committees of which they are members, and the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Attendance by telephone or video conference may be used to facilitate a Director's attendance. 
During 2018, the Board of Directors met 17 times. All directors attended at least 75% of the scheduled Board of Directors' meetings and meetings held by Committees of which they were members. All director nominees serving as directors at that time attended the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 19, 2018, with the exception of Mr. Mitchell and Dr. DeSalvo who were each absent due to prior commitments. 
Executive Sessions of Non-Management Directors 
In 2018, our non-management directors held regularly scheduled, formal executive meetings, separate from management and led by our Chairman. Additional executive sessions of the Board are held as necessary or appropriate or upon the request of the Chairman, the Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee or any two other non-management directors. In addition, our non-management directors who qualify as independent within the meaning of our director independence guidelines meet in executive session at least once annually, and, in fact, met in 2018 in connection with each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting. 
Code of Ethics and Code of Business Conduct 
The Company has adopted the "Code of Conduct for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers," which we refer to as the Executive Code of Ethics, violations of which are reported to the Audit Committee. In addition, we operate under the omnibus Humana Inc. Ethics Every Day, which we refer to as the Code of Ethics, which applies to all associates (including executive officers) and directors. The Humana Ethics Office is responsible for the design and enforcement of our ethics policies, the goal of which is to create a workplace climate in which ethics is so integral to day-to-day operations that ethical behavior is self-enforcing. All employees are required annually to review and affirm in writing their acceptance of the Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics and the Executive Code of Ethics may be viewed on our website at www.humana.com. Any waiver for directors or executive officers from the provisions of the Code of Ethics or the Executive Code of Ethics must be made by the Board of Directors, and will be disclosed within four days of the waiver on our website at www.humana.com. To see either the Code of Ethics or the Executive Code of Ethics or any waivers to either policy, go to www.humana.com, then click on "Investor Relations," then click on "Corporate Governance," and then click on the relevant link. 
Policy Regarding Transactions in Company Securities 
The Company has a policy prohibiting all associates (including executive officers) from hedging or pledging transactions using Company stock, including: (1) engaging in short sales of Company securities; (2) engaging in transactions in puts, calls or other derivative securities designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's equity securities, on an exchange or in any other organized market; or (3) engaging in certain monetization transactions, including holding Company securities in margin accounts or pledging Company securities as collateral.

(2)  Under the Humana Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which  we refer to as the Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors may make an irrevocable election each year to defer compensation paid to them by the Company in the form of cash or stock for services  rendered as Board members. For 2018, Messrs. D'Amelio, Hilzinger, McDonald, Mitchell and O'Brien and Drs. Nash and DeSalvo each deferred their stock compensation. Refer to footnote 1(d) to the section entitled "Stock Ownership  Information — Security Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers" for a disclosure of the number of shares of our common stock that have been deferred by each director. A director electing to defer cash can choose any of the investment  options offered in the Deferred Compensation Plan using Charles Schwab's Retirement Plan Services (other than the Humana Common Stock Fund) or can invest in stock units that have a value relative to that of our common stock. For 2018, Messrs.  Hilzinger, Jones, McDonald and Dr. Nash and Ms. Peterson each elected to defer a portion or all of their cash compensation under the Schwab program.  
(3)  On January 2, 2018, when the fair market value of our common stock was $250.435, each director in office at that  time, other than Mr. Broussard, was granted a stock award of 658 shares, representing the annual grant of approximately $165,000 in common stock. The amount shown in column (c) ("Stock Awards") above is the grant-date fair market  value times the number of shares awarded calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) Topic 718.  
(4)  Vested restricted stock units with a payout deferral election made by the director accrue quarterly dividends equivalent  rights that are reinvested into the director's account as additional restricted stock units and will be included in the final restricted stock unit payment when the shares are issued in accordance with the director's payout election. This  column does not include dividend equivalent units that have accrued through December 31, 2018 nor includes dividend equivalent rights paid on any such deferred shares.  
(5)  Non-employee directors elected subsequent to 1997 do not receive any retirement  benefits. As he was first elected to the board in 1993, David A. Jones, Jr. is the only director that will have retirement benefits under this former retirement policy, including: (A) at the director's election, either: (x) an annual  retirement benefit for the life of the director in the amount of $38,000, the annual retainer fee in effect for 1997; or (y) in lieu thereof, an actuarially equivalent joint and survivor annuity payment; and (B) an annual matching  charitable contribution benefit of $19,000 for the life of the director.  
(6)  Cash compensation for Messrs. Dunbar and O'Brien includes service during 2017 as Chairman of the  Organization & Compensation Committee and Chairman of the Investment Committee, respectively.  
(7)  We pay for or reimburse our directors' travel, lodging and other reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with attendance at board, committee and stockholder meetings. From time to time, we may transport one or more directors and members of their immediate family to and from  such meetings or other Company business on Company aircraft. Directors may elect to participate in the medical and dental benefit programs offered to all our employees at a rate comparable to the rate paid by employees. In 2018,

      Messrs. Dunbar, McDonald and Mitchell, and Dr. DeSalvo and Ms. Peterson, elected to participate. Under the terms  of our director compensation policy, each non-employee director who participates in medical and dental plans provided by Humana will, for two years following the date of completion of a change in control, be  eligible to participate in medical and dental plans on substantially the same terms as immediately prior to the change in control, including the requirement to pay premiums at the same rates as our associates. We also reimburse the director for  other reasonable expenses related to board service, such as director education, which amounts are not included in the table above. In addition, we paid certain local occupational taxes and life and accidental death insurance premiums per outside  director, in each case as disclosed below, and provided a matching charitable gift program.

Stock Ownership Information 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file with the SEC and the NYSE reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and our other equity securities. These reports generally are due within two business days of the transaction. Executive officers, directors, and greater than ten percent stockholders are required to furnish us with copies of all the forms they file. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, based solely on a review of the reports furnished to the Company, or written representations by persons subject to Section 16(a), the Company believes that all executive officers, directors, and greater than ten percent beneficial owners of our common stock complied with Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to us; except for the inadvertent failure to file five reports by Mr. Jones, one of our directors, relating to the disposition of shares in years prior to 2018 from each of two trusts for which Mr. Jones is trustee for the benefit of his children. We have a program to oversee the compliance of our executive officers and directors in their reporting obligations, and following our becoming aware of this omission, we completed a review of our controls and procedures governing transactions in Company securities. 
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners of Company Common Stock

Executive Summary 
We continue to strengthen our consumer-centric strategic approach, moving from a health insurance company to a health company with elements of insurance. Our focus of providing a holistic care approach came to life this year through focused efforts in five areas of influence – Primary Care, the Home, Pharmacy, Behavioral Health and Social Determinants. In 2018, we made advancements in each of these five areas. 
Key Accomplishments 
In addition to our strong financial performance, we are proud of the many strategic accomplishments the Company made in 2018 and have highlighted below just a few of the most outstanding. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have improved the experience for our members, providers and other partners through targeted investments and initiatives,  which have helped to advance our Net Promoter Score (NPS). The decrease in call transfers, increase in digital self-service and the consistency and stability of our IT infrastructure give light to our efforts.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We deepened our clinical capabilities through completing our minority ownership acquisitions of Kindred at Home and Curo  Health. We are now testing and learning new care and payment models in five markets in order to improve health outcomes of members with multiple chronic conditions. Likewise, we also continued to advance our primary care capabilities through our 233  owned, joint venture and alliance clinics. Additionally, we are pleased to report that our two Partners in Primary Care clinics located inside Walgreens stores in Kansas City, Missouri experienced positive results.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We surpassed our STAR-rating goal, with 84 percent of our members enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA) 4 STAR-rated  plans or higher (vs. 74% last year). These ratings are important as they help consumers compare and shop for MA plans based on quality and performance. They also represent a victory for our members in that higher ratings enable us to improve their  benefits, such as enhancing clinical programs that encourage positive lifestyle changes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We also expanded our internal behavioral health model to our nearly 6 million TRICARE members and are now beginning to  insource our Medicare Advantage and Medicaid behavioral health offerings, beginning in Florida. This is an important capability given the role mental health plays in an individual's overall health.

The Committee believes strong corporate governance is imperative for prudent compensation decision-making. Highlighted below are some of the key elements of our compensation programs. In addition, we also identify certain pay practices that we do not follow because we believe they do not serve the long-term interest of our stockholders.

Inputs into Compensation Decisions 
For 2018, the Committee received input from a number of sources and reference points to guide in its design of the Company's executive compensation programs and individual pay decisions. These various perspectives allow the Committee to have visibility into our peer companies' practices, investor viewpoints, changes in external market practices and each executive's individual performance, as part of its review of compensation. The Committee regularly reviews input from its independent compensation consultant and our stockholders, external market practices and individual performance to inform compensation decisions for our NEOs. In addition, the Committee reviews tally sheet information that provides a comprehensive look at total compensation for each of our NEO's as part of its decision-making process. The chart below describes the primary sources contributing to the Committee's decision-making process.

Independent Compensation Consultant 
For 2018, the independent compensation consultant for the Committee was Willis Towers Watson, and a representative of Willis Towers Watson attended all of the regularly scheduled Committee meetings in 2018, including, when invited, executive sessions. In addition, in 2018 management utilized Aon Hewitt to provide certain advice to management regarding executive compensation, independent of advice provided to the Committee. In accordance with the Committee's Charter, the Committee has the sole authority to determine the compensation for, and to terminate the services of, the independent compensation consultant. 
With regard to Willis Towers Watson and Aon Hewitt, the Committee has considered certain factors to determine whether such firm's service as a compensation consultant raised a conflict of interest, including, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the firm provided other services to the Company;

In 2018, we paid Willis Towers Watson approximately $321,000 for executive compensation advisory support services provided to the Committee. In addition, the Committee considered certain advisory services provided by Willis Towers Watson, including corporate risk and broking, and fees for data, surveys and technology, in addition to risk consulting, for which services we paid approximately $1,400,000. After considering the above factors, the Committee determined that the service as an independent compensation consultant of each of Willis Towers Watson and Aon Hewitt did not raise any conflict of interest. 
2018 Stockholder Engagement and Say-on-Pay 
Our Board and Committee routinely review our compensation and governance practices and policies, including our stockholder engagement practices, with a focus on continual improvement and enhancements. We share our stockholder input regularly with our Board, its committees, and our management team, creating a feedback loop that provides stockholders with transparency into those practices and considerations. In addition to stockholder feedback, our Board considers trends in compensation and governance practices and regularly reviews the voting results of our meetings of stockholders, the governance practices of our peers and other large companies, and current trends in governance. Our regular stockholder outreach follows a cyclical process: 
During the 2018 proxy season, following disparate voting recommendations issued by proxy advisory firms with respect to our say-on-pay advisory vote, we reached out to our top 30 stockholders (representing approximately 67% of our outstanding shares), seeking a dialogue and feedback on issues raised in our 2018 proxy statement. During these discussions, we heard from our stockholders that our supplemental proxy materials provided additional context into the rationale and considerations that the Committee evaluated when making 2017 compensation decisions, that our stockholders understood the challenges to our operating environment due to our failed merger, and an appreciation for our pay for performance culture and strong total stockholder return. 
Despite these productive conversations, during our 2018 Annual Meeting, our say-on-pay proposal received approval of 66% of our stockholders who voted, as compared to previous years' support of 95% in 2017 and 97% in 2016. We were disappointed with this lower level of support, and therefore engaged with our stockholders again in the Fall of 2018, seeking additional dialogue regarding our executive compensation program and practices, Board refreshment process, and environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. The Chairman of our Board and the Chair of the Committee participated, when requested, in certain of these conversations with our stockholders.

2018 Peer Group 
Our Peer group is used as a reference point in making compensation decisions, such as developing base salary ranges, developing short-term and long-term incentive award ranges, determining competitiveness of the total compensation package for our NEO's and comparing our performance in order to validate if our compensation programs are informed by market practices. 
We believe that our peer group is comprised of companies with whom we may compete for talent and whose revenues, market capitalization, and business focus are similar to our own. Using different screening criteria (e.g., line of business, industry, market cap, etc.) yields multiple perspectives that enrich our understanding of competitive executive pay practices. The Committee reviews the inclusion of each company every year to ensure continued appropriateness of our overall peer group.

2018 Compensation Decisions 
Overview of Compensation Elements 
We believe that having a combination of pay elements motivates and challenges our executives to achieve positive returns for our stockholders, by placing a substantial portion of pay at-risk. The material components of our executive compensation programs are summarized as follows:

Short-Term and Long-Term Incentive Plan Design 
For 2018 compensation decisions, the Committee evaluated our Short-Term Incentive (STI) and Long-Term Incentive (LTI) plan design to ensure alignment with our strategy, sustainability, external market practices and an appropriate balance of risk and reward to retain, motivate and engage our executives. 
In consultation with the Committee's independent compensation consultant, we conducted a thorough review of our Short-Term and Long-Term incentive plans considering: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Associate Incentive Plan 
The Associate Incentive Plan (AIP) is a discretionary, annual cash-based incentive plan that recognizes and rewards all of our full-time and part-time associates, including our executives, who contribute to our Company's overall performance. On an annual basis the Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, reviews and approves the AIP as outlined below: 
Approve performance Measure Approve individual Target Approve performance Result Approve performance measures and goals, aligned to our business strategy and objectives for the performance year in Q1 2018. Goals are set by the Committee in Q1 of the performance year and align to the Company's overall strategy and our annual financial and operating plans. Review and approve individual, compared to market, based on the executive's scope and responsibilities. Committee certifies the Company performance results against the measures and goals approved in Q1 2018. 
The Committee selected the performance measures for the 2018 AIP, aligning our executives to the key financial and operational objectives of our overall strategy: 
2018 AlP Organizational Performance Measures 
STRATEGIC MEASURES Strategic initiatives that will improve relationships with our providers, improve member health and position the organization for long-term sustainable growthPROFITABILITY Bottom-line measure of our organizations profitability (adjusted Earnings Per Share)MEMBER EXPERIENCE Aligned to our strategy to be a consumer-centric organization and continuous improvement on the member experience (Net Promoter Score) 
The Committee also established a funding gate for our executive officers, whereby no AIP would be paid unless the Company achieves threshold Adjusted EPS performance. In addition, the Committee retains the ability to exercise negative discretion (but not positive discretion) with respect to the payout results. For 2018, based on our performance, the Committee approved a funding rate of 145.1% of target for the CEO and other NEOs as follows:

Long-Term Incentives 
Long-Term Incentives provide a vital link between the long-term results achieved for our stockholders and the financial rewards provided to our NEOs. In February 2018, our Committee reaffirmed its commitment to performance-based compensation by approving the following mix of long-term incentive awards for our NEOs: 
STOCK OPTIONS Aligns the interest of executive officers with stockholders by emphasis on long-term stockholder creation by promoting growth in our stock pricePERFORMANCE-BASEDSTOCK UNITS Three-year cumulative goals for adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC)Represents managements ability to build long-term value of the organization and returns generated by investments in the CompanyHighly correlated with value creation for our stockholdersTSR modifier to adjust final award payouts up or down based on how the Company performs relative to our 2018 peer groupRESTICTED STOCK UNITS Aligns the interest of executive officers with stockholders by emphasis on long-term stockholder creation and assists in retaining talent 
The Committee believed that the combination of award ratio, performance measures and the inclusion of the TSR modifier: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligns executives with the interests of our stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Allows executives to focus on measures they have the ability to influence while also satisfying stockholder expectations of  using a relative measure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ensures that our long-term incentive compensation program is not overly dependent upon rTSR as an independent measure; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusts to general economic conditions that would impact all companies in our peer group.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee, in consultation with its independent compensation consultant, determined the 2018 aggregate amounts and terms of equity compensation awards for each NEO. The Committee performed a review of stock programs and competitive practices of peer companies, as well as the outstanding equity information for each executive officer using tally sheets to examine the value of prior compensation decisions. The 2018 approved equity awards for the CEO and other NEOs are as follows:

*  We have included an Adjusted EPS financial measure (not in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  (GAAP)) in our proxy statement as we believe that this measure, when presented in conjunction with the comparable GAAP measure, is useful to both management and our investors in analyzing our ongoing business and operating performance. The following  excluded items are not recurring parts of our operating plan: (i) loss of approximately $786 million pretax, associated with the Company's sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary, KMG America Corporation (KMG) with GAAP measures affected  including consolidated pretax and EPS; (ii) put/call valuation adjustments of approximately $33 million associated with the Company's 40% minority interest in Kindred at Home (Kindred), with GAAP measures affected including  consolidated pretax and EPS; (iii) amortization expense for identifiable intangibles of approximately $90 million pretax, with GAAP measures affected including consolidated pretax income, EPS, and segment earnings (for respective  amortization expense for the Retail and Group and Specialty segments); (iv) segment earnings of approximately $74 million for the Company's Individual Commercial segment given the Company's exit on January 1, 2018, with GAAP  measures affected including consolidated pretax income, EPS, consolidated revenues, consolidated benefit ratio and consolidated operating cost ratio; and (v) adjustment related to provisional estimates for the income tax effects related to the  tax reform law enacted on December 22, 2017 (Tax Reform Law), with EPS being the only GAAP measure affected. Consequently, we use this non-GAAP financial measure as an indicator of business performance,  as well as for operational planning and decision making purposes. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in  accordance with GAAP. To reconcile the non-GAAP to the GAAP amount each of the following should each be considered, to arrive at GAAP EPS of $12.16:(i) a favorable adjustment on the Company's sale of KMG  in the amount of $2.41; (ii) put/call valuation adjustments associated with the 40% minority interest in Kindred of $0.18; (iii) amortization associated with identifiable intangibles of $0.49; (iv) segment losses (earnings) associated with the  Individual Commercial segment of ($0.41); (v) and adjustments to provisional estimates for the income tax effects related to Tax Reform Law ($0.28).

2018 CEO Pay Ratio: ~231:1 
Calculation Approach 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our CEO Pay Ratio was calculated in compliance with the requirements set forth in Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We identified our median employee using our associate population as of December 31, 2018, which included  41,600 global full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal associates employed on that date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We consistently applied 2018 W-2 earnings as compensation measure for the median  employee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For 2018, our median employee participated in the AIP, as discussed further in this proxy statement under the section titled  "Compensation Discussion & Analysis - 2018 Compensation Decisions - Associate Incentive Plan." The 2018 AIP compensation was not included within the 2018 W-2 earnings, as this cash compensation, although earned for 2018, is payable  during 2019. Therefore, to determine the median employee compensation, we applied the final AIP payout of 145.1% of the target opportunity (based on overall Company performance, as discussed in the above referenced section) to the median  employee's total W-2 compensation. This payout as a percentage of target was consistent across our population of eligible employees, before any adjustments for individual contributions, including the final payout for our CEO and other NEOs;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We then calculated the median employee's compensation in the same manner as the NEOs in the Summary Compensation Table;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Applying this methodology, our median employee total compensation was $70,498, which includes a base salary of $60,373 and  2018 AIP achievement of $10,125; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Chief Executive Officer total compensation was  $16,312,517.

(4)  In 2018, our Named Executive Officers were awarded 25% of their equity grants in the form of stock options. Stock  options awarded to our Named Executive Officers are incentive stock options to the extent allowed by regulation and the balance are treated as nonqualified stock options.

The  above options expire seven years from the date of grant. The exercise price may be paid in cash or, at the discretion of the Committee, in shares of our common stock valued at the fair market value on the date of exercise or any combination thereof.  Under our stock plan, the Board may not reduce the exercise price for options or stock appreciation rights by re-pricing or replacing any option award.  
(5)  Options under our stock plan cannot be granted at less than the Fair Market Value, defined in our stock plan as the  average of the highest and lowest reported sales prices of our common stock in transactions reported on the composite tape by the NYSE on the grant date. Our stock plan was approved by our Board of Directors and by our stockholders.   
(6)  The February 19, 2018 grant date was a NYSE observed holiday, therefore the closing price on the prior open market  day (February 16, 2018) is used.  
(7)  Discloses the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock unit awards and stock option awards granted in the  fiscal year, calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, "Compensation — Stock Compensation."

(1) Broussard Employment Agreement 
The Company and Mr. Broussard have in force an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, dated as of February 27, 2014, later amended on July 2, 2015 and August 16, 2018, which we refer to herein as the Broussard Agreement. The table above discloses potential payments upon termination or a Change in Control that would be owed to Mr. Broussard under the Broussard Agreement as of December 31, 2018. Effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Broussard and the Company agreed that, with respect to severance and Change in Control benefits, including with respect to the treatment of equity granted on or after January 1, 2019, Mr. Broussard would be governed by the Severance Policy and Change in Control Policy generally applicable to the Company as described below in Note 2 and Note 4. 
Pursuant to the Broussard Agreement, if Mr. Broussard's employment is terminated (a) by the Company other than for Cause or Disability or (b) by Mr. Broussard for Good Reason, in addition to accrued compensation, we will pay or provide to Mr. Broussard, (i) a pro-rated portion of the annual incentive he would have earned for the entire year based on the Company's actual performance or, in the case of a calendar year that ends after a Change in Control, based on the Target Annual Incentive (a "Pro-Rated Incentive Payment"), (ii) an amount equal to the sum of (x) two times Mr. Broussard's then-current base salary plus (y) two times the Target Annual Incentive for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs (or one times the Target Annual Incentive if the Termination Date occurs after December 31, 2018), and (iii) continuation of coverage for Mr. Broussard and his dependents under the Company's medical and dental benefit plans at the same cost to Mr. Broussard as if his employment had continued, until the earliest of 24 months following termination or the effective date of Mr. Broussard's coverage under equivalent benefits from a new employer. Mr. Broussard would have Good Reason to resign and trigger severance benefits upon the occurrence of one of the following: (i) a material and adverse change in Mr. Broussard's duties, authorities and responsibilities, (ii) a reduction in Mr. Broussard's base salary or target incentive opportunity, other than in connection with an across-the-board reduction applicable to all senior executives of the Company, (iii) the relocation of Mr. Broussard's principal place of business resulting in an increase in Mr. Broussard's one-way commute of more than 30 miles, or (iv) the failure of the Company to continue in effect a material incentive or other compensation plan unless the Company substitutes a plan providing substantially equivalent compensation opportunities.

[END TABLE]
In addition to the above, the following will apply to Mr. Broussard's equity-based compensation awards, granted on or prior to December 31, 2018, that are outstanding on the Termination Date upon a termination of Mr. Broussard's employment by us without Cause or by Mr. Broussard for Good Reason in circumstances not related to a Change in Control, notwithstanding any contract provision in the applicable award agreement or plan under which the award is granted:

(iii)  all vested stock options will remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of the second anniversary of the  termination date and the term of the stock option; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iv)  a pro-rated portion of all performance-based equity awards other than stock  options will remain outstanding until the end of the applicable performance period (or, if earlier, upon a Change in Control) and the vesting will be determined based on (a) actual level of performance attained, or (b) in the case of any  performance period that ends after a Change in Control, the target level of performance.  
[END TABLE]
In the table above, time-based equity awards other than stock options are shown assuming pro rata vesting as of December 31, 2018, and performance-based equity awards that are subject to continued vesting requirements are not included. 
In the event that Mr. Broussard's employment is terminated by us other than for Cause or by Mr. Broussard for Good Reason within 24 months following a Change in Control (as defined in the Broussard Agreement), or by us without Cause under certain circumstances prior to a Change in Control, in addition to accrued compensation, we will pay or provide to Mr. Broussard: (i) a Pro-Rated Incentive Payment, (ii) an amount equal to two times the sum of (x) Mr. Broussard's then-current base salary plus (y) the Target Annual Incentive for the fiscal year in which the Termination Date occurs, and (iii) continuation, at the Company's expense, of all life, medical, dental, accidental death and dismemberment and disability insurance for Mr. Broussard and his dependents until the earliest of 24 months following termination or the effective date of Mr. Broussard's coverage under equivalent benefits from a new employer. 
In addition to the above, the following will apply to Mr. Broussard's equity-based compensation awards, granted on or prior to December 31, 2018, that are outstanding on the Termination Date upon a Change in Control Termination, notwithstanding any contract provision in the applicable award agreement or plan under which the award is granted: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i)  all time-based equity awards other than stock options will become vested and all restrictions thereon will lapse as of the  date of termination;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(v)  all of the shares subject to outstanding performance-based equity awards other than stock options will remain outstanding  and the vesting (which will not be prorated) will be determined based on (a) actual level of performance attained for any performance period that ends prior to the Change in Control, or (b) in the case of any performance period that ends  after a Change in Control, the target level of performance. Performance-based equity awards other than stock options that are subject to continued vesting requirements are not included in the table above.  
[END TABLE]
In the event that Mr. Broussard's employment is terminated due to his death or Disability, we would pay or provide (i) a Pro-Rated Incentive Payment and (ii) (A) continuation of coverage for Mr. Broussard and his dependents under our medical and dental benefit plans at the same cost to Mr. Broussard or his dependents as if his employment had continued, for up to 18 months, if such termination is before a Change in Control, or (B) continuation, at our expense, of all life, medical, dental, accidental death and dismemberment and disability insurance for Mr. Broussard and his dependents for 24 months, if such termination is on or after a Change in Control. In addition, any outstanding equity awards granted on or prior to December 31, 2018 held by Mr. Broussard upon the termination of his employment due to death or Disability will be treated as follows: (i) all time-based equity awards other than stock options will become vested and all restrictions thereon will lapse as of the termination date, (ii) all time-based stock options will become vested and exercisable as of the termination date, (iii) all performance-based stock options will become vested and exercisable as of the termination date as if the target performance level had been attained, (iv) all vested stock options (including those that vest pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii)) will remain outstanding and exercisable until the earlier of the second anniversary of the termination date and the term of the stock option, and (v) a pro-rated portion of all performance-based equity awards other than stock options that would have vested at the end of the applicable performance period had the target performance level been attained will vest as of the termination date. In the table above, performance-based equity awards are shown at the target level of performance. 
Pursuant to our long-standing Company policy, the Broussard Agreement does not contain an excise tax gross-up provision with respect to payments contingent upon a change in control. The Broussard Agreement does provide that, if (i) Mr. Broussard had become entitled to payments that would have been "parachute payments" in connection with a change in control of the Company that would have subjected him to the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) the aggregate amount of such payments that he would have received, after all taxes, had been less than he would have received if such payments were reduced below the threshold above which the excise tax would have applied, then (iii) such payments would have been reduced to $1.00 below such threshold so that Mr. Broussard would not have become subject to the excise tax. 
The Broussard Agreement also contains certain restrictive covenants related to competition and solicitation. During the Restricted Period, Mr. Broussard may not (i) participate in any business which competes with our Company Business in any Geographic Area in which the Company and/or any of its Affiliates is then conducting business; nor (ii) solicit, recruit or otherwise induce or influence any employee of the Company to accept employment in any business which competes with the Company Business, in any Geographic Area in which the Company and/or any of its Affiliates is then doing business; nor (iii) interfere with the relationship of the Company and any of its employees, agents, representatives, consultants or advisors; nor (iv) divert, or attempt to cause the diversion from the Company, any Company Business; nor (v) interfere with relationships of the Company with its policyholders, agents, brokers, dealers, distributors, marketers, sources of supply or customers. After January 1, 2019, Mr. Broussard continues to be bound by these restrictions through the Severance Policy and Change in Control Policy, each described further below in Note 2 and Note 4, respectively. 
(2) Severance Policy 
We have a Severance Policy that covers all of our Named Executive Officers. Under the Severance Policy our Named Executive Officers, if involuntarily terminated for reasons not meeting the definition of Cause in the Severance Policy would receive salary continuation for eighteen (18) months following the termination date at an annual rate equal to their then current Annual Base Salary. In addition, terminated executives would remain eligible to receive prorated incentive compensation to be paid at the normal time after year end, provided plan targets and other plan provisions were met. The calculations in the table assume a December 31, 2018 termination and incentive compensation for the full year at the target threshold. 
Under the terms of the Severance Policy, the Named Executive Officer is also required to enter into a written agreement that forbids him or her from competing and includes specific provisions relating to non-disparagement and cooperation. 
Since December 31, 2018, the Company has adopted an amended Severance Policy which is discussed under the section entitled "2018 Compensation Decisions — Other Benefits and Perquisites" in this proxy statement. 
(3) Stock Option and Restricted Stock Unit Agreements 
At December 31, 2018, the Named Executive Officers have stock options and restricted stock units (with both time-based and performance-based vesting) outstanding under our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the Stock Plan. The treatment of these equity awards will vary depending upon the nature of the termination. As described above, as of December 31, 2018, the treatment of Mr. Broussard's outstanding equity awards is governed by the Broussard Agreement. The amounts disclosed in the table assume treatment of stock options and restricted stock units based on the December 31, 2018 fair market value of $284.565. 
Voluntary Termination. Under the Stock Plan, upon a voluntary termination for reasons not having to do with Cause or Retirement, in each case as defined below, each Named Executive Officer would have 90 days to exercise any vested options, but in no event beyond the expiration date. Any unvested stock options held by our Named Executive Officers would be forfeited. Any unvested restricted stock units held by our Named Executive Officers would also be forfeited. Any unvested stock options held by our Named Executive Officers would be forfeited. Any unvested restricted stock units held by our Named Executive Officers would also be forfeited. upon a voluntary termination for reasons not having to do with Cause or Retirement, in each case as defined below; provided, however, that the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that the restrictions on some or all of such unvested restricted stock units shall immediately lapse upon such termination. 
Involuntary Termination without Cause. Under the Stock Plan, upon an involuntary termination by the Company for reasons other than Cause, each Named Executive Officer would have 90 days to exercise any vested options, but in no event beyond the expiration date. Any unvested stock options held by our Named Executive Officers would be forfeited. Any unvested restricted stock units held by our Named Executive Officers would also be forfeited. In addition, our equity grant agreements contain non-compete and non-solicit provisions that only remain in full force and effect following an involuntary termination by the Company for reasons other than Cause if we pay an amount at least equal to the Named Executive Officer's then current annual base salary. Any such amounts that could be paid post-termination to enforce non-compete and non-solicit provisions are not included in the table above. 
Involuntary Termination for Cause. Under the Stock Plan, in the event of termination for Cause, all options and unvested restricted stock units are forfeited for all Named Executive Officers, regardless of whether the options are vested. Under the Stock Plan, Cause is defined as "a felony conviction of a Participant or the failure of a Participant to contest prosecution for a felony, or a Participant's willful misconduct or dishonesty, any of which is determined by the Committee to be directly and materially harmful to the business or reputation of the Company or its Subsidiaries."

[END TABLE]
Retirement. Under the Stock Plan, an eligible Retirement means a combination of age and years of service with the Company totaling 65 or greater, with a minimum required age of 55 and a minimum requirement of five years of service. With respect to grants of options prior to July 2, 2015, in the event of an eligible Retirement by a Named Executive Officer, any outstanding options (x) that have vested as of the retirement date of that Named Executive Officer will be exercisable within two years of such retirement date, and (y) that have not vested as of the retirement date of that Named Executive Officer will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedule and will be exercisable within two years of the vesting date of such options. In the event of an eligible Retirement by a Named Executive Officer, any unvested restricted stock units will continue to vest according to their original vesting schedule. For awards granted after July 2, 2015, in the event of an eligible Retirement by a Named Executive Officer, any outstanding options and restricted stock units will vest pro rata. 
Death or Disability. Under the Stock Plan, in the event of death or Disability of a Named Executive Officer, all outstanding options shall become immediately exercisable in full and the Named Executive Officer, or his estate or representative shall have two years to exercise the options regardless of the expiration date. Under the Stock Plan, in the event of death or Disability of a Named Executive Officer, any unvested restricted stock units shall immediately vest, and any unvested shares of performance-based restricted stock units will vest at the maximum level. 
Change in Control. Under the Stock Plan, in the event of a termination for Cause or resignation for Good Reason within two years following a Change in Control, (x) all outstanding options shall become immediately exercisable in full and the Named Executive Officer shall have two years to exercise the options, but in no event beyond the expiration date, and (y) any unvested restricted stock units shall immediately vest, and any unvested shares of performance-based restricted stock units will vest at the target level. 
(4) Change in Control Policy and Benefits 
We have a Change in Control Policy (CIC Policy), as adopted by the Organization & Compensation Committee, which replaced our former practice of entering into individual CIC Agreements. For the period ended December 31, 2018, eligibility under the CIC Policy is limited to CEO Direct Reports and certain senior level management. The CIC Policy provides certain benefits in the event an eligible employee's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause or by the employee with Good Reason within twenty-four months following a Change in Control, or by the Company without Cause under certain circumstances prior to a Change in Control (each capitalized term is defined in the CIC Policy). The table assumes treatment of each Named Executive Officer (other than Mr. Broussard) under the CIC Policy. 
Under the CIC Policy for the period ended December 31, 2018, Named Executive Officers would be entitled to receive a Cash Severance which generally is determined as twice the sum of each individual's annual base salary and the target incentive compensation payable to him or her. Assuming a Change in Control and subsequent termination event had occurred at December 31, 2018, the payments set forth in the table above would have been made within ten days of the termination event (or such later date as may be required by Section 409A) by the surviving company in the Change in Control. See the discussion herein under Note 3. 
Further, under the CIC Policy, each Named Executive Officer is entitled to receive all life insurance, health insurance, dental insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and disability insurance under plans and programs in which the Named Executive Officer and/or the Named Executive Officer's dependents and beneficiaries participated immediately prior to the date of termination. These benefits shall continue for 18 months following termination. These benefits are valued at the amounts listed in the table above for the applicable period. 
Pursuant to our long-standing Company policy, the CIC Policy does not include an excise tax gross-up provision with respect to payments contingent upon a change in control. 
Since December 31, 2018, the Company has adopted an amended CIC Policy which is discussed under the section entitled "2018 Compensation Decisions — Other Benefits and Perquisites" in this proxy statement. 
(5) Pension and Retirement Plans 
In the event of termination, each Named Executive Officer would receive their account balance under the Humana Retirement Equalization Plan disclosed in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table together with their Humana Retirement Savings Plan benefit. The Humana Retirement Savings Plan is a qualified 401(k) plan generally available to all Humana associates. The amounts below include both the individual's contribution and the Company's contributions. At December 31, 2018, the account balances under the Humana Retirement Savings Plan for the Named Executive Officers are as follows (which amounts are not included in the table above):

[END TABLE]
The Humana Retirement Savings Plan amounts are payable under various forms of distribution, the specific form to be elected by the participant. The forms of distribution are a single lump sum in cash or our common stock (if invested in the Humana common stock fund); substantially equal monthly, quarterly, or annual installments for a period of 5, 10, 15 or 20 years not to exceed the life expectancy of the participant, or the joint and last survivor expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary. 
(6) Retirement 
As noted above, under the Stock Plan, the definition of retirement eligibility means a combination of age and years of service with the Company totaling 65 or greater, with a minimum required age of 55 and a minimum requirement of five years of service. For additional information on the stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units held by each of our Named Executive Officers, please refer to the table entitled, "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End" in this proxy statement. The table above does not include amounts that would be realized from this continued vesting of stock option, restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards. 
(7) Life, Health and Other Benefits 
Upon termination (other than a termination in connection with a Change in Control as described above), all officers elected by our Board of Directors, including our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Broussard, whose benefits are governed by the Broussard Agreement, as described in Note 1 above), are eligible for continuation of health and dental coverage pursuant to COBRA. Such coverage is not included in the table above (except for a Change in Control, where a two year expense for health benefits is included, assuming a 10% increase in premiums year over year). 
In the event of death, the estate of each Named Executive Officer is entitled to receive a life insurance benefit in the amount of three times the current base salary of the officer (up to a maximum of $3 million), reduced by 50% when the age of 70 has been attained. As of December 31, 2018, the amount payable under such death benefit, which is not included in the table above, is as follows for our Named Executive Officers:

Certain Transactions with Management and Others 
The Board of Directors has determined that there are no material transactions involving a director of the Company. For a discussion of the transactions reviewed, please see the discussion under "Independent Directors" herein. 
The Board of Directors has determined that there are no material transactions involving an executive officer or greater than 5% stockholder, other than the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During 2018, the Company had an agreement with BlackRock, Inc., or BlackRock, which holds greater than five percent of the  Company's outstanding stock as of December 31, 2018. Under this agreement, BlackRock provided fixed income investment management services to the Company, for which the Company paid approximately $4.09 million in fees for the year  ended December 31, 2018. The fees were determined solely on the amount of assets under management, and, to our knowledge, were comparable to those of non-affiliated customers.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has adopted a policy for review, approval and monitoring of transactions involving the Company and directors and executive officers or their immediate family members, or stockholders owning five percent or greater of the Company's outstanding stock. The policy covers any related person transaction that meets the minimum threshold for disclosure under the SEC's regulations. The Related Party Transaction Approval Policy may be viewed on our website. From the www.humana.com website, click on "Investor Relations," then click on "Corporate Governance," and then click on the link entitled "Policy Regarding Related Person Transaction." Pursuant to that policy, our Board of Directors has approved the continuation for 2019 of the above described relationship. 
Audit Committee Report 
Our Audit Committee currently is comprised of three directors. All members are independent and are financially literate as defined in the NYSE listing standards. The Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. D'Amelio and O'Brien each meet the definition of "audit committee financial expert." The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Committee. 
As set forth in its Charter, our Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged to prepare the audit report or perform other audit, review or attestation services. The Audit Committee has retained PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. PwC has been retained as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since 1968. 
The Audit Committee reviews Humana's financial reporting processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, with Humana's management and its independent registered public accounting firm, PwC. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. PwC is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management has represented to PwC and the Audit Committee that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with PwC its independence from Humana and its management including the matters in the written disclosures required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. 
During 2018, the Audit Committee met independently with our Chief Audit Officer, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Compliance Officer, key members of management, and PwC regarding our business, current and planned audit activities, and risks that could impact the Company and management actions to mitigate those risks. The Audit Committee, in consultation with management, Internal Audit, and PwC, reviewed our quarterly financial statements and earnings releases. The Audit Committee reviewed our annual financial statements. Audit Committee members individually reviewed our monthly operating and financial information as well as internal audits of controls over operations, financial processes, and compliance with laws and regulations. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and evaluated the relevant requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the rules of the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE regarding audit committee procedures and responsibilities, including a review of our internal controls and procedures. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the services provided by PwC to us consisting of the following:

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee discussed with our internal auditors and with PwC the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. At each meeting, the Audit Committee is provided the opportunity to meet with the internal auditors and with PwC with and without management present, and, in fact, met with the internal auditors and with PwC with and without management present in connection with each regularly scheduled Board of Directors meeting in 2018. 
The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures for pre-approving all audit, review and attest services that are required under the securities laws and all other permissible tax and non-audit services necessary to assure PwC's continued independence. The Audit Committee annually pre-approves the following permissible non-audit services: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• related assurance and attestation services;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• risk and control services;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• transaction services; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• tax services.  
[END TABLE]
The fees shown in the table above were all pre-approved in accordance with these policies and procedures. The Audit Committee separately will consider any proposed retention of the independent registered public accounting firm for permissible non-audit services other than those listed above. The Audit Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the Company's retention of PwC. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Humana Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
All members of the Audit Committee of the Company whose names follow submit the foregoing report:

Proposal Two 
Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Background 
The Board of Directors, in accordance with the recommendation of its Audit Committee, believes that the continued retention of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and therefore has appointed PwC to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019. In making this appointment, the Board considered the performance and independence of PwC, including whether any non-audit services performed by PwC are compatible with maintaining independence. The Audit Committee and Board of Directors believe that PwC has invaluable long-term knowledge of Humana. While preserving that knowledge, partners and employees of PwC engaged in audits of Humana are periodically changed, giving Humana access to new expertise, experience and perspectives. 
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the appointment of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although ratification is not required by our Charter, Bylaws, Delaware law or otherwise, the Board is submitting the appointment of PwC to our stockholders for ratification because we value our stockholders' views on our independent registered public accounting firm. If our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, it will be considered as a non-binding recommendation to the Board and the Audit Committee to consider the appointment of a different firm for fiscal year 2020. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Board and the Audit Committee may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. We expect that representatives of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting and will be afforded the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and to respond to appropriate questions. 
Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present and entitled to vote with respect to the proposal is required for the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Shares not present at the meeting have no effect on the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, while shares voting "abstain" will be counted as "against" votes. Pursuant to NYSE regulations, brokers and other NYSE member organizations have discretionary voting power over the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.

Proposal Three 
Non-Binding Advisory Vote with Respect to the Compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers 
Background 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires that we include in our proxy statement a non-binding advisory stockholder vote with respect to the frequency of future advisory votes regarding the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosure, set forth in this proxy statement (commonly referred to as "Say-on-Pay"). 
At our 2017 Annual Meeting, held on April 20, 2017, our stockholders recommended an annual Say-on-Pay vote, and our Board of Directors subsequently adopted that recommendation. In 2019, we are therefore asking our stockholders to vote on the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Humana Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative disclosure, set forth in the Company's proxy statement. 
The compensation of our Named Executive Officers is disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the related disclosures contained in this proxy statement. As discussed in those disclosures, our philosophy is that compensation should be market-based, competency-paced and contribution-driven. Our compensation programs are designed to challenge participants as well as reward them for superior performance for our Company and our stockholders, with an emphasis on pay for performance principles to align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our stockholders. Our compensation practices and policies enable us to attract and retain talented and experienced executives to lead the Company successfully in a competitive environment. 
Your vote on this Proposal Three is an advisory one, and therefore is not binding on the Company, the Organization & Compensation Committee, or the Board. The vote will not be construed to create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of the Company or the Board, or to create or imply any additional fiduciary duties for the Board. Nevertheless, our Board and our Organization & Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders, and intend to consider any stockholder concerns evidenced by this vote. We will continue to evaluate and disclose whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
Vote Required and Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present and entitled to vote with respect to the proposal is required for the approval of the non-binding advisory vote with respect to the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers. Shares not present at the meeting and broker non-votes have no effect on the approval of this non-binding advisory vote, while abstentions will count as votes "against." Pursuant to NYSE regulations, brokers do not have discretionary voting power over this proposal, and therefore, if you hold Shares through a broker or other NYSE member organization and do not provide voting instructions to your broker or other NYSE member organization, your Shares will not be voted with respect to this proposal. If you timely submit a signed proxy but fail to specify instructions to vote with respect to this proposal, the accompanying proxy will be voted FOR this proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DESCRIBED IN THE COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, THE COMPENSATION TABLES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES CONTAINED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. 
Proposal Four 
APPROVAL OF THE 
HUMANA INC. STOCK 
INCENTIVE PLAN 
Upon the recommendation of the Organization & Compensation Committee, or the Committee, the Board of Directors has adopted the Amended and Restated Humana Inc. Stock Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the Stock Plan, subject to stockholder approval at the April 18, 2019 Annual Meeting. The Stock Plan will amend and restate the current Humana Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2011 Plan"). If approved, the Stock Plan will replace the 2011 Plan, empower the Company through the Committee to grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance awards, and other stock-based and cash-based grants and awards to directors, executive officers, and other employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
We are asking our shareholders to approve the Stock Plan at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors believes that in order to attract, retain and reward valuable personnel, it is important for the Company to maintain a flexible, long-term, stock-based incentive plan, which is both competitive with and responsive to rapidly changing industry standards. The Stock Plan provides the Company with the ability to devise incentive programs that are responsive to the demands of the marketplace and are aligned with stockholder interests. 
Below is an executive summary of this proposal and the Stock Plan, as well as a brief description of the Stock Plan. The description of the Stock Plan in this Proxy Statement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Stock Plan, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. You may also obtain a copy of the Stock Plan by accessing this Proxy Statement as filed with the SEC on the Internet at www.sec.gov, by accessing the Investor Relations section of our website, www.humana.com, or by contacting our Corporate Secretary. 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL AND SELECTED PLAN INFORMATION 
Introduction 
On February 21, 2019, the Board approved and adopted, subject to shareholder approval, the Stock Plan to amend and restate the 2011 Plan, which would otherwise expire under its terms in 2021. If approved by our shareholders, going forward all grants of equity based awards to our employees and directors will be made under the Stock Plan and shares currently available under the 2011 Plan will no longer be available for issuance. If the shareholders do not approve the Stock Plan, we will continue to grant awards under the unamended 2011 Plan until the expiration of the 2011 Plan or the date that shares authorized for issuance under the 2011 Plan are completely depleted, whichever occurs first. As of January 31, 2019, 4.67 million shares remain available for grant under the 2011 Plan. 
Material Changes to the Stock Plan 
In addition to the request for more shares described below, we are seeking shareholder approval of the following material amendments to the Stock Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amendment to limit grants to directors providing that the maximum number of shares subject to awards made to a non-employee director under the Stock Plan in a single fiscal year, taken together with any cash fees paid to such non-employee director in respect of such fiscal year, will  not exceed $1,500,000 for the non-employee Chairman of the Board and $1,000,000 for all other non-employee directors in total value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amendments to specify the treatment of outstanding awards upon specific termination events;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amendment clarifying that shares tendered to pay taxes or to satisfy the exercise price for options, as well as shares  that we repurchase using proceeds from the exercise of options will not be available for future awards under the Stock Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amendment providing for the automatic adjustment to certain performance objectives to reflect prescribed events that  result in a change to the applicable performance objectives in excess of pre-established threshold amounts;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amendment providing that an acquiring corporation may assume or cancel outstanding awards and not provide for automatic  vesting upon a change in control;  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An amendment providing that awards granted under the Stock Plan are subject to a recoupment (clawback) policy; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Amendments clarifying that there are no dividends or dividend equivalents on options or stock appreciation rights and that  dividends and dividend equivalent rights, if any, on all other awards will be subject to the same vesting requirements as the underlying award and will only be paid at the time those vesting requirements are satisfied.  
[END TABLE]
Proposed Share Reserve 
If approved, a total of 16,000,000 shares of common stock will be available for issuance pursuant to future awards granted under the Stock Plan, resulting in a total of 16,000,000 being available for future issuance. The purpose of the Stock Plan is to allow the Company to design and grant equity-based awards that will provide long-term incentives to our directors, executive officers, and other employees, while aligning their interests with those of our shareholders. The Board believes that the increased number of shares available for issuance under the Stock Plan are necessary to permit us to continue to provide the type of long-term, performance-based compensation necessary to allow us to attract, retain and motivate our directors, executive officers, and other employees. 
Impact on Dilution and Fully-Diluted Overhang 
Our Board recognizes the impact of dilution on our shareholders and has evaluated this share request carefully in the context of the need to motivate, retain and ensure that our leadership team is focused on our strategic and long-term growth priorities. The total fully-diluted overhang as of December 31, 2018, assuming that the entire share reserve is granted in stock options, would be 11.0% and the total fully-diluted overhang, assuming the share reserve is granted in full-value awards only, would be 4.1%. The Company's historical practice, which is not currently expected to change, has been to grant a combination of stock options and full-value awards, resulting in overhang between these two levels. In this context, fully diluted overhang is calculated as the sum of grants outstanding and shares available for future awards (numerator) divided by the sum of the numerator and basic common shares outstanding, with all data effective as of December 31, 2018. Our Board believes that the number of shares of common stock that would be available for issuance under the Stock Plan represents a reasonable amount of potential equity dilution given our strategic and long-term growth priorities. 
Expected Duration of the Share Reserve 
We expect that the share reserve under the Stock Plan, if this proposal is approved by our shareholders, will be sufficient for awards for at least five to six years. Expectations regarding future share usage could be impacted by a number of factors, such as award type mix; hiring and promotion activity at the executive level; the rate at which shares are returned to the Stock Plan's reserve upon the awards' expiration, forfeiture or cash settlement; the future performance of our stock price; the consequences of acquiring other companies; and other factors. While we believe that the assumptions we used are reasonable, future share usage may differ from current expectations.

Administration 
The Stock Plan will be administered by the Committee, with each member qualifying as (i) a "non-employee director" under Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) an "independent" director under the current New York Stock Exchange standards for director independence. 
In administering the Stock Plan, the Committee will determine, among other things: (i) the individuals to whom grants or awards will be made; (ii) the type and size of awards; and (iii) the terms of each award including, but not limited to, vesting schedule, grant price, restriction or performance criteria, and length of relevant performance, restriction or option periods. 
The Committee may delegate to one or more directors, or one or more executive officers, the power to grant and administer awards under the Stock Plan to participants who are not executive officers. The Committee may also construe, interpret and correct defects, omissions and inconsistencies in the Stock Plan. 
Participation 
The Committee may grant Awards under the Stock Plan to any director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliated entities. The Company's non-employee directors currently receive annual awards as described in this proxy statement under "Director Compensation, and the Company's Named Executive Officers received annual awards as described in this proxy statement under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "Grants of Plan-Based Awards." 
Shares of Company Stock Available for Issuance 
The Stock Plan authorizes the issuance of up to sixteen million (16,000,000 Shares). No individual may be granted more than twenty percent (20%) of the total Shares authorized for the Stock Plan over the term of the Stock Plan. In addition, the maximum value of cash or property other than Shares that may be paid or distributed in a calendar year to any participant pursuant to a grant of performance units is limited to $3,000,000 for the Chief Executive Officer and $1,500,000 for any other participant. The stock subject to the provisions of the Stock Plan will be authorized but unissued Shares or treasury Shares. 
If any Shares subject to any award under the Stock Plan are forfeited or the award otherwise terminates without the issuance of such shares, those Shares will again be available for grant under the Stock Plan, and will be added back as (a) one (1) Share for each one (1) Share subject to an Option or Stock Appreciation Right or (b) three and thirty-five hundredths (3.35) Shares for every one (1) Share subject to an Award other than an Option or Stock Appreciation Right. Shares that are (A) withheld to cover tax withholding obligations of the participant (B) tendered as payment to satisfy the exercise price of an option for an option exercise and (C) added back that have been repurchased by the Company using option exercise proceeds will, in each, case count against the number of Shares that may be issued under the Stock Plan. 
Pursuant to the Stock Plan, the number and kind of Shares to which awards are subject may be appropriately adjusted in the event of certain changes in capitalization of the Company, including stock dividends and splits, reclassification, recapitalization, reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, spin-offs, split-ups, combinations or exchanges of Shares. 
Types of Stock Incentive Awards to be Granted 
Subject to the limits under the Stock Plan, the Committee has the discretionary authority to determine the size of the award, the type of award, and whether it will be tied to meeting performance-based requirements or will vest solely over time. 
The types of awards that may be made under the Stock Plan are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options are the right to  purchase Shares where the value is based on the appreciation in the underlying Shares in excess of an exercise price, which right may be exercised by the holder during the term of the option, which is not to exceed ten years, unless earlier  terminated upon certain events, such as for cause. The exercise price of stock options granted under the Stock Plan is determined by the Committee, but may not be less than the fair market value of a Share on the date the option is granted, defined  as the average of the highest and lowest sale price of Humana Inc. common stock reported on the composite New York Stock Exchange tape on that date. The amount of incentive stock options vesting in a particular year cannot exceed the maximum amount  permitted under Section 422 of the Code, determined using the aggregate fair market value of the Shares on the date of grant. In its sole discretion, the Committee may provide, at the time of grant, that the Shares to be issued upon an  option's exercise will be in the form of restricted stock or other similar securities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock appreciation rights entitle a participant to receive upon exercise an amount equal to the number of Shares  subject to the award multiplied by the excess of the fair market value of a Share at the time of exercise over the exercise price (which may not be less than the fair market value on the grant date). Stock appreciation rights may be paid in cash,  Shares, other property or any combination thereof, Any stock appreciation rights related to an option other than an incentive stock option may be granted at the same time the option is granted or at any time thereafter before exercise or expiration  of the option. Any stock appreciation rights related to an

     incentive stock option must be granted at the same time the option is granted. A stock appreciation right related to an option, or the applicable portion thereof, will terminate and no longer be  exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the related option. Any option related to a stock appreciation right that is exercised will cease to be exercisable to the extent the related stock appreciation right has been exercised.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted stock and restricted stock units are stock-based awards that do not require purchase, but which are not  immediately available to the recipient until certain restrictions lapse, either based solely on continued employment or service with the Company for specified periods or based on the attainment of specified performance criteria. Restricted stock  units represent Shares which, upon vesting, may be settled in Shares or in cash equal to the fair market value of the number of Shares represented by the restricted stock unit. Restricted stock units are not outstanding until paid in stock and  therefore do not have voting or dividend rights.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Awards are awards of restricted stock or units in which the recipient vests only upon satisfaction of  certain performance criteria during a performance period as may be determined by the Committee. With certain exceptions, payment with respect to performance units and vesting of performance shares will occur only after the end of the relevant  performance period. Performance units may be paid in cash, Shares (including restricted shares), other property or any combination thereof, in the sole discretion of the Committee at the time of payment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Stock Awards may be issued to participants that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are  otherwise based on, Shares. Such awards may be paid in Shares, cash or any combination or other property as the Committee may determine.  
[END TABLE]
Performance Objectives 
The performance criteria established by the Committee with respect to any performance awards will be based on the following objectives: (i) earnings per share; (ii) share price; (iii) consolidated net income (iv) pre-tax profits; (v) earnings or net earnings; (vi) return on equity or assets; (vii) sales; (viii) cash flows from operating activities; (ix) return on invested capital; (x) membership; (xi) other performance objectives as determined by the Committee, or (xii) any combination of the foregoing. These performance objectives may be established in respect to the performance of the Company, any of its subsidiaries, any of its divisions or any combinations thereof. 
To preserve the intended incentives and benefits of an award based on performance objectives, performance objectives will be adjusted to reflect any of the following events, subject to such event resulting in a change to the applicable performance objective in excess of an aggregate threshold amount established by the Committee at the time of the granting of the applicable performance award; (A) the acquisition or disposition of a business, a merger, or a similar transaction, and the related integration costs including external costs such as legal, accounting and consulting fees and internal costs such as severance and benefits, contract cancellation costs, lease abandonment costs, overhead costs of integration including allocated wages and benefits and administrative costs in connection therewith; (B) impact of securities issuances or repurchases in connection with an acquisition or disposition of a business, a merger, or a similar transaction, and related expenses including both direct and incremental costs incurred in connection therewith; (C) changes in accounting principles, tax laws, or other laws, provisions or regulations; (D) any litigation or regulatory investigations not in the ordinary course of business; (E) restructuring activity, including, but not limited to, reductions in force not in the ordinary course of business; (F) impact of exit or disposal activities, such as the close of blocks of business, market or product exits, asset sales or abandonments, contracts placed in run-off, related premium deficiency reserves or capital charges; and (G) any extraordinary, natural disaster, unusual and/or infrequent event, including, but not limited to those defined by SEC Regulation S-K Item 10(e), as appropriate for reporting as non-GAAP financial measures. The Committee still in all events retains the discretion to reduce (but not increase) any award, regardless of the result of any adjustments described above. 
In addition, the Committee may determine at the time performance objectives are established that certain adjustments may apply to the objective formula or standard with respect to the applicable performance objective to take into account, in whole or in part, in any manner specified by the Committee, any one or more of the following: (i) the gain, loss, income or expense resulting from changes in accounting principles that become effective during the performance period; (ii) the gain, loss, income or expense reported publicly by the Company with respect to the performance period that are extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence; (iii) the gains or losses resulting from, and the direct expenses incurred in connection with the disposition of a business, or the sale of investments or non-core assets; (iv) the gain or loss from all or certain claims and/or litigation and all or certain insurance recoveries relating to claims or litigation; (v) the impact of impairment of tangible or intangible assets including goodwill; (vi) the impact of restructuring or business recharacterization activities, including but not limited to reductions in force, that are reported publicly by the Company; or (vii) the impact of investments or acquisitions made during the year, or to the extent provided by the Committee, any prior year. Each of the adjustments described in this section may relate to the Company as a whole or any part of the Company's business operations. The adjustments are to be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and standards, unless the Committee designates another objective method of measurement. 
Termination, Death or Disability 
Termination for Cause 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, if a participant is terminated for cause, all rights of such participant under any outstanding award will terminate. 
Retirement 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a participant's Retirement (as defined below), any option or stock appreciation right that was exercisable at the date of such Retirement will be exercisable for the two year period after the date of such Retirement (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right). Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, to the extent any option or stock appreciation right granted under the Stock Plan was not exercisable at the date of such Retirement, or to the extent the restrictions on any Shares of restricted stock, performance awards or restricted stock units have not lapsed at the date of such retirement, a prorated portion of the award that would have vested on the next scheduled vesting date (as set forth in the applicable award agreement) will vest (and any restrictions will lapse) and become exercisable (as applicable) upon the next scheduled vesting date, with the proration to be determined by calculating the product of (A) the quotient of (x) the number of completed months the participant has been employed since the date of grant of the award or the most recent vesting date, as applicable, divided by (y) the number of months in the current vesting period, multiplied by (B) the total number of options or stock appreciation rights, or Shares of restricted stock, performance awards or restricted stock units (taking into account achievement of the applicable performance goals) that were scheduled to vest and become exercisable on the next scheduled vesting date, provided, that, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that the restrictions on some or all of the options, stock appreciation rights, Shares of restricted stock, performance awards or restricted stock units held by the participant as of the date of Retirement will immediately lapse. Any option or stock appreciation right that vests and becomes exercisable pursuant to the foregoing will be exercisable for the two year period following the vesting date of such option or stock appreciation right (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right). 
The foregoing calculation of additional vesting is generally referred to herein as the "Pro-Rated Vesting Calculation." For purposes of the Pro-Rated Vesting Calculation, a month is complete on the day in the following month that corresponds to the date of grant. 
For purposes of the Stock Plan, "Retirement" means a participant's retirement from the Company or a subsidiary, as applicable on or after the first day of the month coincident with or following the date on which all of the following will have occurred: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  the participant has completed five years of retirement service;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b)  the participant has reached at least age 55; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(c)  the participant's age plus years of retirement service equals or exceeds 65.  
[END TABLE]
A participant's "years of retirement service" will be determined as provided for in the Humana Retirement Savings Plan, as may be amended from time to time. 
Death or Disability 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon death or disability, all outstanding options and stock appreciation rights of that participant then outstanding will become immediately exercisable in full and will remain exercisable for two years after the date of death regardless of the expiration of the option or stock appreciation right, or two years after the date of determination of disability, regardless of the expiration of the option or stock appreciation right, except in each case for incentive stock options which may not be exercised later than the expiration date of the options. Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon death or disability, all restrictions or performance criteria applicable to any Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards will immediately lapse (with performance awards being deemed vested at target levels), and such Shares or other property will thereafter be immediately transferable and nonforfeitable. 
Divestiture of the Business to which the Participant Provides Services 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a termination due to a "divestiture" (as defined below) of the business to which the participant provides services, to the extent any option or stock appreciation right (or a portion thereof) granted under the Stock Plan was not exercisable at the date of such divestiture (1) if the Company maintains a strategic interest in the divested business, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, the unvested portion of the option or stock appreciation right will continue to vest, in accordance with the original vesting schedule, as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company and (2) if the Company does not maintain a strategic interest in the divested business, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, the unvested portion of the option or stock appreciation right will continue to vest, in accordance with the original vesting schedule, upon the regular vesting dates that would occur during the twelve month period following the termination as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company during such twelve month period, and any portion of the option or stock appreciation right that vests pursuant to the foregoing will be exercisable for the ninety day period following the last date on which any portion of the option or stock appreciation right vests (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right). To the extent any option or stock appreciation right granted under the Stock Plan was exercisable at the date of a divestiture of the business to which the participant provides services, the option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for the ninety day period following the last date on which any portion of the option or stock appreciation is scheduled to vest (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right) and only to the extent it was exercisable on the date of such termination.

Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a termination due to a divestiture of the business to which the participant provides services, (1) if the Company maintains a strategic interest in the divested business, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, any Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards will continue to vest, in accordance with the original schedule, as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company and (2) if the Company does not maintain a strategic interest in the divested business, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, (A) the unvested portion of any Shares of restricted stock or unvested restricted stock units will continue to vest, in accordance with the original schedule, upon the regular vesting dates that would occur during the twelve month period following the termination as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company during such twelve month period, provided, that, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that the restrictions on some or all of the Shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units held by the participant as of the date of termination of employment will immediately lapse and (B) any unvested performance awards will vest based on the Pro-Rated Vesting Calculation. 
For purposes of the Stock Plan, a "divestiture " means the sale or other transfer of equity securities of a subsidiary to a person or entity other than the Company or an affiliate of the Company, or if a subsidiary leases, exchanges or transfers all or any portion of its assets to such a person or entity, then the Committee may specify that such transaction or event constitutes a "divestiture." 
Transfer to a Strategic Joint Venture 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a termination due to a transfer to a "strategic joint venture" (as defined below), to the extent any option or stock appreciation right (or a portion thereof) granted under the Stock Plan was not exercisable at the date of such termination, the unvested portion of the option or stock appreciation right will continue to vest, in accordance with the original schedule, as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company, and such vested option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for the ninety day period following the last date on which any portion of the option or stock appreciation vests (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right). Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, to the extent any option or stock appreciation right granted under the Stock Plan was exercisable at the date of such termination, the option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for the ninety day period following the last date on which any portion of the option or stock appreciation is scheduled to vest (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right), and only to the extent it was exercisable on the date of such termination. 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a termination due to a transfer to a "strategic joint venture" the unvested portion of any Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards will continue to vest, in accordance with the original schedule, as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company (taking into account achievement of applicable performance goals with respect to performance awards), provided, that, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that the restrictions on some or all of the Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards held by the participant as of the date of termination of employment will immediately lapse. 
For purposes of the Stock Plan, a "strategic joint venture " means a business arrangement entered into by the Company with one or more other parties to own and operate an entity in which the Company continues to have a strategic interest. 
Workforce Reduction or a Position Elimination 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a termination due to a transfer to a "workforce reduction" or "position elimination" (each as defined below), to the extent any option or stock appreciation right (or a portion thereof) granted under the Stock Plan was not exercisable at the date of such termination, the unvested portion of the option or stock appreciation right will continue to vest, in accordance with the original vesting schedule, upon the regular vesting dates that would occur during the twelve month period following the termination as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company during such twelve month period, and any portion of the option or stock appreciation right that vests pursuant to the foregoing will be exercisable for the ninety day period following the last date on which any portion of the option or stock appreciation right vests (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right). To the extent any option or stock appreciation right granted under the Stock Plan was exercisable at the date of such termination, the option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable for the ninety day period following the last date on which any portion of the option or stock appreciation is scheduled to vest (but not beyond the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right) and only to the extent it was exercisable on the date of such termination. 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, upon a termination due to a transfer to a "workforce reduction" or "position elimination", (A) the unvested portion of any Shares of restricted stock or unvested restricted stock units will continue to vest, in accordance with the original vesting schedule, upon the regular vesting dates that would occur during the twelve month period following the termination as if the participant were continuing to provide services to the Company during such twelve month period and (B) any unvested performance awards will vest based on the Pro-Rated Vesting Calculation, provided, that, the Committee may determine, in its sole discretion, that the restrictions on some or all of the Shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards held by the Participant as of the date of termination of employment will immediately lapse. 
For purposes of the Stock Plan, a "Workforce Reduction" means a reduction in force, as determined by the Company in accordance with its standard coding procedures, and a "Position Elimination" means the elimination of the participant's position in accordance with standard coding practices. 
Change in Control Termination 
If an award is assumed, converted, continued or substituted in connection with a "Change in Control" (as defined in the Stock Plan), the award will continue to vest in accordance with its existing terms (with any award that vests based on the achievement of performance goals to have such performance goals deemed to have been achieved at target level but continue to be subject to any time-based vesting requirements); provided, however, that if the participant's employment is terminated within two years immediately following the Change in Control (i) by the acquirer or successor for any reason other than Cause or (ii) by the participant for Good Reason (as such terms are defined in the Stock Plan) (each a "Qualifying Termination"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  any options and stock appreciation rights that are assumed, converted, continued or substituted in connection with a  Change in Control and that are outstanding as of the date of the participant's Qualifying Termination will become fully vested and immediately exercisable in its entirety and the options or stock appreciation rights will remain excisable until  the second anniversary of the date of termination of the participant's employment, but in no event beyond the applicable expiration date of the award; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  the restrictions, limitations and other conditions applicable to any restricted stock award, restricted stock unit,  performance share, performance unit, or share award that are assumed, converted, continued or substituted in connection with a Change in Control and that are outstanding as of the date of the participant's Qualifying Termination will lapse and  the restricted stock award, restricted stock unit, performance share, performance unit, or share award will become free of all restrictions, limitations and conditions and become fully vested and, to the extent applicable, will settle in accordance  with the terms of the applicable award agreement.  
[END TABLE]
Other Terminations 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, if the employment, directorship or consultancy of the participant is terminated for any reason other than for cause, Retirement, death, disability, a divestiture of the business, workforce reduction, position elimination or the participant's transfer to a strategic joint venture, any outstanding option or stock appreciation right will be exercisable by such participant at any time prior to the expiration date of the option or stock appreciation right or within ninety days after the date of such termination, whichever is the shorter period, but only to the extent the option or stock appreciation right was exercisable at the time of termination. 
Except as otherwise determined by the Committee, any outstanding awards that are not exercisable or that do not vest, as applicable, in accordance with the above provisions will be forfeited upon the participant's termination, 
Effect of Certain Transactions 
Generally, in the event of a liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or a merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company, unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, outstanding awards will either: 
1.    Unless otherwise provided in connection with the transaction, continue and be adjusted if and as provided in connection with the transaction, which may include in the discretion of the Committee, the assumption, conversion or continuation of the award by, or the substitution for such awards of new awards of, the successor (or a parent or subsidiary thereof), with such adjustments as to the number and kind of shares or other securities or property subject to such new awards, exercise prices and other terms as the Committee or the parties to the transaction agree; or 
2.    Terminate upon the transaction. In the event the awards are terminated, the holders of awards are entitled to receive in respect of each Share subject to any award the same payment (whether in cash or other consideration, which value will be determined by the Committee in its discretion) that each holder of a Share was entitled to receive in the transaction in respect of a Share. The treatment of outstanding options and stock appreciation rights may include the cancellation of such options and stock appreciation rights in connection with the transaction if the holders of such affected options and stock appreciation rights are given a period of at least fifteen days prior to the date of the consummation of the transaction to exercise their options or stock appreciation rights (to the extent they were otherwise exercisable) or paid an amount equal to the excess of the consideration received by shareholders in the transaction over the exercise price of the option or stock appreciation right. 
In the event of a Change in Control, to the extent the award is not assumed, converted, continued or substituted (i) any outstanding options and stock appreciation rights will become fully vested and immediately exercisable immediately prior to the Change in Control, (ii) the restrictions, limitations and other conditions applicable to any other awards will lapse and the award will become fully vested. Any award that vests based on achievement of performance goals will vest with such performance goals deemed to have been achieved at the target levels.

The Board of Directors may terminate or amend the Stock Plan at any time without stockholder approval, except for any amendment that would (i) increase the maximum number of shares issuable under the Stock Plan, (ii) reprice or replace options by reducing the exercise price, or (iii) change the individuals or class of individuals eligible to participate in the Stock Plan. No amendment may impair the rights of a participant with respect to outstanding awards without the participant's consent. 
Registration with the SEC 
If the Stock Plan is approved by our stockholders, the Company intends to file a registration statement with the SEC to register the Shares that could be awarded under the Stock Plan as soon as practicable after such approval. 
Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The Company believes that under present law, the following are the U.S. federal income tax consequences generally arising with respect to grants of stock under the Stock Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Options. The grant of an option will create no tax consequences for a participant or the Company. A participant will  have no taxable income upon exercising an incentive stock option after the applicable incentive stock option holding periods have been satisfied (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply), and the Company will receive no deduction when an  incentive stock option is exercised. Upon exercising an option other than an incentive stock option, a participant must recognize ordinary income equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Shares on the date of exercise and the  exercise price. The Company will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount. The treatment to a participant of a disposition of Shares acquired through the exercise of an option depends on how long the Shares were held and on whether the Shares  were acquired by exercising an incentive stock option or by exercising an option other than an incentive stock option. Generally, there will be no tax consequence to the Company in connection with a disposition of Shares acquired under an option,  except that the Company may be entitled to a deduction in the case of a disposition of Shares acquired under an incentive stock option before the applicable incentive stock option holding periods have been satisfied.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Appreciation Rights. The amount of any cash (or the fair market value of any Shares) received upon the exercise  of a stock appreciation right under the Stock Plan will be includable in a participant's ordinary income. Subject to any deduction limitation under Section 162(m) or 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will be entitled to a  deduction equal to the amount of such ordinary income recognized by the participant (subject to the limitations discussed below).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of restricted stock, and  the recognition of any income will be postponed until such shares are no longer subject to the restrictions or the risk of forfeiture. When either the restrictions or the risk of forfeiture lapses, the participant will recognize ordinary income  equal to the fair market value of the restricted stock at the time that such restrictions lapse less any amount paid by the participant for the restricted stock. A participant who is eligible for Retirement at the time of a restricted stock grant,  or who becomes eligible for Retirement during the vesting period of a restricted stock award, may be subject to income and employment taxes at the time of the restricted stock grant, or upon becoming eligible for Retirement, respectively. Subject to  any deduction limitation under Section 162(m) or 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount included in the participant's gross income (subject to the limitations discussed below). A  participant may elect to be taxed at the time of the grant of restricted stock (rather than being taxed at the time that the respective restrictions lapse) and, if this election is made no later than 30 days after the date of grant, the participant  will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the restricted stock at the time of grant determined without regard to any of the restrictions thereon over the amount paid, if any, by the participant for such shares.  The Company would be entitled to a correlative deduction.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock Units. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of restricted stock  units, and the recognition of any income will be postponed until such units are settled in cash or shares. A participant who is eligible for Retirement at the time of a grant of restricted stock units, or who becomes eligible for Retirement during  the vesting period of an award of restricted stock units, may be subject to income and employment taxes at the time of the grant of restricted stock units, or upon becoming eligible for Retirement, respectively. Subject to any deduction limitation  under Section 162(m) or 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount included in the participant's gross income (subject to the limitations discussed below).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Shares. Generally, a participant will not recognize any taxable income upon the award of performance  shares. Upon vesting of the common stock at the end of the applicable performance period free of all restrictions, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the Shares on the date of vesting, and, subject to  the deduction limitation under Section 162(m) or 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction at such time equal to the amount recognized by the participant (subject to the limitations discussed below).  Alternatively, the participant may elect to be taxed at the time of the grant of the performance shares or restricted stock, as described above. The Company will be entitled to a deduction equal to the amount recognized by the participant (subject  to the limitations discussed below) at the time such amount is recognized by the participant, subject to the deduction limitation under Section 162 (m) or 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Units. Generally, a participant will not recognize any taxable income upon the award of performance  units. At the end of the applicable performance period, an amount equal to the amount of cash or fair market value of common stock received will be recognized as ordinary income by the participant and, subject to the deduction limitation under  Section 162(m) or 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company will be entitled to a deduction at such time equal to the amount recognized by the participant (subject to the limitations discussed below).  
[END TABLE]
Section 162(m) Limit. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that, subject to certain exceptions, Humana may not deduct compensation paid to any one of certain executive officers in excess of $1 million for any one fiscal year. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act amended Section 162(m) to provide that, in general, for compensation which is paid or would otherwise become deductible after 2012, no deduction will be allowed to the extent total compensation for an individual exceeds $500,000 for the year. This limitation applies to most individuals compensated by a health insurance provider such as Humana. Under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, there is no longer an exclusion for performance-based compensation, whether pursuant to a plan such as the Stock Plan or otherwise. 
New Plan Benefits 
Because benefits under the Stock Plan will depend on the Committee's actions and the fair market value of our Shares at various future dates, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by directors, executive officers and other employees if the Stock Plan is approved by our stockholders. Information concerning awards under the Humana Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan is available in this proxy statement in the following tables and the narrative accompanying them: Summary Compensation Table, Grants of Plan Based Awards, Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End, Option Exercises and Stock Vested, Director Compensation and Equity Compensation Plan Information. On February 8, 2019, the fair market value of our Shares was $298.89. 
Vote Required and Recommendation of Board of Directors.    The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal is required for the approval of the Amended and Restated Humana Inc. Stock Incentive Plan. Shares not present at the meeting and Shares voting "abstain" or broker non-votes have no effect on the approval of the Amended and Restated Humana Inc. Stock Incentive Plan. Pursuant to NYSE regulations, brokers do not have discretionary voting power over the approval of the incentive compensation plan. Therefore, if you hold Shares through a bank, broker or other nominee and do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, your Shares may not be voted with respect to this proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE TO APPROVE THE AMENDED AND RESTATED HUMANA INC. STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

In the event that dividends are to be deferred, the Committee shall determine whether such dividends are to be reinvested in Shares (which shall be held as additional  Shares of Restricted Stock) or held in cash. If deferred dividends are to be held in cash, there may be credited at the end of each year (or portion thereof) interest on the amount of the account at a rate per annum as the Committee, in its  discretion, may determine. Payment of deferred dividends in respect of Shares of Restricted Stock (whether held in cash or as additional Shares of Restricted Stock), together with interest accrued thereon, if any, shall be made upon the lapsing of  restrictions imposed on the Shares in respect of which the deferred dividends were paid, and any dividends deferred (together with any interest accrued thereon) in respect of any Shares of Restricted Stock shall be forfeited upon the forfeiture of  such Shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  To the extent that the Committee grants Dividend Equivalent Rights, such Dividend Equivalent Rights shall be deferred  until the lapsing of the restrictions imposed upon such Dividend Equivalent Rights or until the vesting, exercise, payment, settlement, or other lapse of restrictions on the Award to which the Dividend Equivalent Rights relate; provided, however  that a Dividend Equivalent Right granted in tandem with another Award that vests based on the achievement of performance goals shall be subject to restrictions and risk of forfeiture to the same extent as the Award with respect to which such  dividends are payable. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the Award to which the Dividend Equivalent Rights relate is forfeited, the related Dividend Equivalent Rights shall also be forfeited. In the event that the amount payable in respect  of Dividend Equivalent Rights is to be deferred, the Committee shall determine whether such amount is to be held in cash or reinvested in Shares or deemed (notionally) reinvested in Shares. Dividend Equivalent Rights may be settled in cash or Shares  or a combination thereof, in a single installment or multiple installments, as determined by the Committee.  
[END TABLE]

The Committee may, at the  time a Restricted Stock Unit is granted, provide a limitation on the amount payable in respect of each Restricted Stock Unit. The Committee may provide for the settlement of Restricted Stock Units in cash or with Shares having a Fair Market Value  equal to the payment to which the Participant, or in such combination of Shares and cash as the Committee in its discretion shall determine.

Such payments may be made entirely in Shares valued at the Fair Market Value, entirely in cash, or in such combination of Shares and cash as the Committee in its discretion shall determine; provided, however, that if the  Committee in its discretion determines to make such payment entirely or partially in Shares of Restricted Stock, the Committee must determine the extent to which such payment will be in Shares of Restricted Stock and the terms of such Restricted  Stock at the time the Award is granted.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  Rights of Participant. The Committee shall provide at the time an Award of Performance Shares is made the time or  times at which the actual Shares represented by such Award shall be issued in the name of the Participant; provided, however, that no Performance Shares shall be issued until the Participant has executed an Award Agreement evidencing the Award, the  appropriate blank stock powers and, in the discretion of the Committee, an escrow agreement and any other documents which the Committee may require as a condition to the issuance of such Performance Shares. If a Participant shall fail to execute the  Award Agreement evidencing an Award of Performance Shares, the appropriate blank stock powers and, in the discretion of the Committee, an escrow agreement and any other documents which the Committee may require within the time period prescribed by  the Committee at the time the Award is granted, the Award shall be null and void. At the discretion of the Committee, Shares issued in connection with an Award of Performance Shares shall be deposited together with the stock powers with an escrow  agent (which may be the Company) designated by the Committee. Unless the Committee determines otherwise and as set forth in the Award Agreement, upon delivery of the Shares to the escrow agent, the Participant shall have all of the rights of a  stockholder with respect to such Shares, including the right to vote the Shares and to receive all dividends or other distributions paid or made with respect to the Shares.

  (b)  Non-transferability. Until all restrictions upon the Performance Shares  awarded to a Participant shall have lapsed, such Shares shall not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of and shall not be pledged or otherwise hypothecated, nor shall they be delivered to the Participant.
