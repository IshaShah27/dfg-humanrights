Dear Fellow Stockholders: 
I hope you will join us at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Darling Ingredients Inc. The attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement will serve as your guide to the business to be conducted. 
We first want to thank you for your investment in Darling Ingredients and for the confidence you put in our Board to oversee your interests in our business. Once again last year, as part of our effort to continuously get better, we reached out to stockholders representing approximately 75% of our outstanding shares and held direct conversations with every stockholder who responded to our engagement request, with the Chairman of our Compensation Committee leading the discussions regarding, among other things, compensation practices, corporate governance and Board composition. 
Among the items we improved upon in 2018 was our Corporate Social Responsibility disclosures, which better demonstrate our commitment to drive meaningful progress toward a cleaner, safer and sustainable environment. In addition, we continued our commitment to Board refreshment with the recent appointment of Nicole Ringenberg to our Board. Nicole's appointment aligns well with our governance strategy, and, after a 32-year career with Monsanto Company, she brings unique and strategic insights related to sustainable agricultural solutions, global operations with an emphasis on Asia, corporate finance expertise, and advancing diversity across our workforce. 
We also continued to execute on our world of growth strategy in 2018, with the completion of four bolt-on acquisitions and the commissioning of seven new and expanded plants, all of which increase our production capacity for premium, sustainable ingredients. In addition, Diamond Green Diesel (DGD), our joint venture with Valero Energy Corporation that converts sustainable low carbon feedstocks produced by the Darling system (such as animal fats, recycled greases and used cooking oil), inedible corn oil, or other feedstocks that become economically and commercially viable into renewable diesel, completed the expansion of its production facility to increase annual production capacity from 160 million gallons to 275 million gallons of renewable diesel and to expand its outbound logistics to better service the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. Furthermore, we approved DGD moving forward with an additional expansion project expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021, which will grow the facility's annual production capacity by an additional 400 million gallons of renewable diesel and provide the capability to produce and sell renewable naphtha. Renewable diesel is a biomass-based fuel that is interchangeable with petroleum-based diesel fuel but has a carbon lifecycle low enough to meet the most stringent low-carbon fuel standards. 
Once again, on behalf of the entire Board, we'd like to express our appreciation for your continued support of Darling Ingredients.

PROXY SUMMARY 
BOARD HIGHLIGHTS 
During fiscal 2018, the Board continued its commitment to Board refreshment with the appointment in November 2018 of Nicole M. Ringenberg to the Board and as a member of the audit committee (for which she was designated as an "audit committee financial expert" in accordance with the requirements of the NYSE and the SEC). With her many years of senior management experience at a Fortune 200 company, Ms. Ringenberg possesses skills and experience that complement and enhance those of our other Board members. Following Ms. Ringenberg's appointment, sixty-four percent (64%) of our current directors have served on the Board for less than five years. All of our current directors have been nominated by the Board for reelection at the Annual Meeting. We believe that our director nominees exhibit an effective mix of skills, experience and fresh perspective. For more information on all of the director nominees, see page 13 of this Proxy Statement. 
COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS 
Our company is a global developer and producer of sustainable natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients, creating a wide range of ingredients and customized specialty solutions for customers in the pharmaceutical, food, pet food, feed, technical, fuel, bioenergy, and fertilizer industries. Our long-term strategy is to be recognized as the global leader in the production, development and value-adding of sustainable animal and nutrient recovered ingredients. 
2018 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Fiscal 2018 presented a challenging operating environment, as our business continued to experience the impacts of a continued multi-year deflationary cycle within the agriculture sector and continued pricing pressure from increased global supplies of grains, proteins and oilseeds. Despite these challenging operating conditions, we continued to successfully execute on our strategy to de-lever and to achieve operational and financial improvements intended to stabilize and grow profitability in businesses and geographic areas where sustainable and predictable margins can be achieved, as exemplified by the following: 
Key Operating Accomplishments 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Invested $108 million in growth acquisitions with no net borrowings, resulting in a reduction in the companys  total debt to EBITDA ratio to 3.13 from 3.47 in 2017.

[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     DGD finished the year debt free, while at the same time expanding production capacity by 70%.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Growth Achievements 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Completed the expansion of Diamond Green Diesels (DGDs) production facility to increase annual production  capacity from 160 million gallons to 275 million gallons of renewable diesel and to expand outbound logistics to better service the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and worldwide. DGD is our joint venture with  Valero Energy Corporation, that converts animal fats, recycled greases, used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, soybean oil, or other feedstocks that become economically and commercially viable into renewable diesel, a biomass-based fuel that is  interchangeable with petroleum-based diesel fuel but has a carbon lifecycle low enough to meet the most stringent low-carbon fuel standards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Approved the DGD joint venture moving forward with an additional expansion project expected to be completed in the fourth  quarter of 2021, which will grow the facilitys annual production capacity by an additional 400 million gallons from the current capacity of 275 million gallons of renewable diesel to 675 million gallons of renewable diesel,  provide the capability to separate naphtha, a byproduct of the production process, for sale into low carbon fuel markets and expand inbound and outbound logistics to better service the many developing low carbon fuel markets around North America and  worldwide.

[END TABLE]
PROXY SUMMARY 
[BEGIN TABLE]

∎     Completed bolt-on acquisitions in the United States of a rendering and used cooking  oil collection business, thereby helping us to better serve our customers and the growing feedstock demand from DGD, and a wet pet food ingredient business, thereby further expanding our premium protein business for the growing pet food industry.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Completed the acquisition of a food grade animal fat processing business in Poland, thereby enlarging our production  portfolio with high-end food grade fats and strengthening our current position in Poland, an important growth area.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Expanded our organic fertilizer business through upgrades to our existing facilities in the United States and the  acquisition of a new organic fertilizer production facility in California to meet the needs of organic growers operating in California and the entire western region of the United States.

[END TABLE]
Realigned Capital Structure for Operating Conditions and Future Growth 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Successfully refinanced the companys 4.75% senior Euro-notes due 2022 through the issuance of new 3.625% senior  Euro-notes due 2026, thereby reducing interest costs and providing more flexibility going forward.  
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
Pay for Performance. A large portion of our executives' total direct compensation is "at-risk" through long-term equity awards and annual cash incentive awards. These awards are linked to actual performance and include a significant portion of equity. Our compensation committee has designed our executive compensation program to deliver pay in alignment with corporate, business unit and individual performance primarily based on the following three factors, which in turn are expected to align executive pay with returns to stockholders over time: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Expansion of our company, both organically and through acquisitions, as well as through investments, such as DGD, within the  context of the business cycle, as our scale creates the platform for future growth and influences the stability of our companys earnings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Our effectiveness in deploying capital when compared to our Performance Peer Group (as defined on page 33 of this Proxy  Statement); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     The total shareholder return of our company as compared to our Performance Peer Group.

PROXY SUMMARY 
As the following chart shows, by designing our executive compensation program based on these factors, the realizable pay levels provided by our executive compensation program to our CEO are aligned to our stock price performance over the long-term:

    TSR Index Measure:                                                       
    1-Year TSR Indexed to  2013=100        100.0           87.4           50.6           62.2           87.3           91.7

[END TABLE]
NOTES: 
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance is indexed to 2013, where 2013 equals 100 on the Index. 
Realizable pay reflects the actual cash and intrinsic value of equity incentives awarded in a given year, using the stock price at the end of the year. For example, for 2018, realizable pay equals base salary plus annual incentives earned for 2018 performance plus options granted on January 29 , 2018 and shares to be issued in the first quarter of 2021, assuming target PSU performance for 2018 to 2020 for PSUs awarded on January 29, 2018, plus the reported Summary Compensation Table values for Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings and All Other Compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  *  In 2014, the figures above also show the potential realizable value based on the December 31, 2014 stock price of a  special award of performance share units awarded at the closing of the acquisition of VION Ingredients. One-third of the award relating to 2014 performance was earned and vested; the remaining two-thirds of the award relating to 2015 and 2016 annual performance results were not earned and were forfeited. The committee does not consider special award programs to be part of the ongoing compensation program.   
[END TABLE]
Our compensation committee believes that our executive compensation program effectively aligns pay with performance based on the key factors discussed above, thereby aligning executive pay with returns to stockholders and creating a growth-oriented, long-term value proposition for our stockholders. For more information, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Executive Overview – Pay for Performance" included in the Proxy Statement. 
Say On Pay Advisory Vote Results and Stockholder Engagement Process. We have conducted a stockholder engagement process for the past several years and routinely interact with stockholders throughout the year about executive compensation and other matters. Stockholders are also provided an annual opportunity to provide feedback through an advisory say on pay vote on executive compensation. For 2016, our executive compensation program was significantly redesigned in response to stockholder feedback and say on pay results. At our 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings, approximately 98.6% and

4    2019 Proxy Statement          
[END TABLE]
PROXY SUMMARY 
 97.1%, respectively, of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. Additionally, in 2018, members of our compensation committee and management reached out to stockholders representing approximately 75% of our outstanding shares and held direct conversations with every stockholder who responded to our engagement request. Overall, we spoke with stockholders representing approximately 38.5% of our outstanding shares, with the chairman of our compensation committee leading the discussions. Stockholder engagement and the outcome of the say on pay vote results will continue to inform future compensation decisions. 
Compensation Program Enhancements. Over the last several years, the compensation committee and our Board significantly changed our compensation program after reviewing trends in executive compensation and pay-related governance policies and in response to say on pay results and stockholder feedback. We believe that these changes, which included the changes shown in the chart below, significantly enhanced our compensation program by sharpening alignment between executive compensation and the interests of our stockholders. 
Adopted separate metrics for our annual incentive bonus and LTI programs Re-evaluated our peer group to better align with our company Adopted double-trigger vesting for change in control in our long-term equity awards Shifted from a backward-looking/ trailing perfromance measurement to a forward-looking performance measurement for our LTI plan Adjusted LTI value mix to 60% PSUs and 40% stock options Reduced the maximum annual incentive payout from 300% to 200% of target Added a relative total shareholder return metric in the LTI program

Corporate Social Responsibility/Sustainability 
In addition, for us, respect for the environment and a commitment to the development of sustainable natural ingredients are the foundation on which our company is built. In this regard, we continuously look for new and better ways to optimize nutrition and health—for both people and animals—and to minimize our environmental impact, all while creating value for our stockholders. Our commitment to social responsibility goes beyond compliance. We operate in ways that, wherever possible, leave a positive impact on the environment, food and feed safety and people's communities and work places. In this regard, during fiscal 2018, we updated the Social Responsibility/Sustainability portion of our corporate website to better reflect and report on our corporate social responsibility and sustainability practices. In addition, during fiscal 2018 Diamond Green Diesel, our joint venture with Valero Energy Corporation, (i) completed the expansion of its production facility to increase the annual production capacity at the facility from 160 million gallons to 275 million gallons of renewable diesel, a biomass-based fuel produced from animal fats, recycled greases, used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, soybean oil, or other feedstocks that become economically and commercially viable that is interchangeable with petroleum-based diesel fuel but has a carbon lifecycle low enough to meet the most stringent low-carbon fuel standards, and (ii) approved and began work on an additional project to further expand the annual production capacity to 675 million gallons.

            CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[END TABLE]
In accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and our Amended and Restated Bylaws, our business, property and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. 
Independent Directors 
Under the corporate governance listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") and our company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board must consist of a majority of independent directors. In making independence determinations, the Board observes NYSE and Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") criteria and considers all relevant facts and circumstances. The Board, in coordination with its nominating and corporate governance committee, annually reviews all relevant business relationships any director nominee may have with our company. As a result of its annual review, the Board has determined that, with the exception of Dirk Kloosterboer, each of its other non-employee directors who served during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, Charles Adair, D. Eugene Ewing, Linda Goodspeed, Mary R. Korby, Cynthia Pharr Lee, Charles Macaluso, Gary W. Mize, Michael E. Rescoe and Nicole M. Ringenberg, meet the independence requirements of the NYSE and the SEC. Mr. Kloosterboer served as our Chief Operating Officer until his retirement effective October 1, 2017. As a result, he will not be eligible to meet the independence requirements of the NYSE until at least October 1, 2020. Even though Mr. Kloosterboer is not currently determined to be independent, he contributes greatly to the Board and our company through his wealth of experience, expertise and judgment, particularly with respect to our international operations. 
Meetings of the Board 
During the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018, the Board held six regular meetings and two special meetings. Each of the then-serving directors attended at least 75% of all meetings held by the Board and all meetings of each committee of the Board on which the applicable director served during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. 
Communications with the Board 
Stockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with the Board as a whole, or with individual directors, may direct any correspondence to the following address: c/o Secretary, Darling Ingredients Inc., P.O. Box 141481, Irving, Texas 75014-1481. The Corporate Secretary will promptly relay all communications to the appropriate directors, other than communications that are unrelated to the duties and responsibilities of the Board or its committees. Those unrelated matters include, without limitation, business solicitations, advertisements and surveys; requests for donations and sponsorships; job referral materials such as resumes; product-related communications; unsolicited ideas and business proposals; and material that is determined to be illegal or otherwise inappropriate. 
It is a policy of the Board to encourage directors to attend each annual meeting of stockholders. The Board's attendance allows for direct interaction between stockholders and members of the Board. All of our then-serving directors attended our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Under our Board's current leadership structure, we have a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, an independent Lead Director, Board committees comprised entirely of independent directors and active engagement by all directors. Randall C. Stuewe, our Chief Executive Officer, serves as our Chairman of the Board pursuant to his employment agreement and subject to his continued election to the Board by stockholders. Because the Chairman of the Board is also the Chief Executive Officer, the Board has designated an independent director with robust, well-defined duties to serve as Lead Director to enhance the Board's ability to fulfill its responsibilities independently. We believe that the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with an empowered independent Lead Director, is at the current time the optimal Board structure to provide independent oversight and hold management accountable while ensuring that our company's strategic plans are pursued to optimize long-term stockholder value.

Duties and Responsibilities of Lead Director 
Our company has an empowered independent Lead Director who is elected annually by our Board. The Board has most recently appointed Mr. Macaluso as Lead Director. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines establish well-defined duties for the Lead Director. The Lead Director's role includes:

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board Leadership Structure 
This list of duties of the Lead Director does not fully capture Mr. Macaluso's active role in serving as our Board's Lead Director. Among other things, Mr. Macaluso encourages and facilitates active participation of all directors, regularly speaks with our Chief Executive Officer regarding the business and affairs of our company, generally attends meetings of all Board committees and meets with other members of management from time to time. 
Leadership Structure – Details and Rationale 
Our Board is committed to objective, independent leadership for our Board and each of its committees. Our Board views the objective, independent oversight of management as central to effective Board governance, to serving the best interests of our company and our stockholders, and to executing our strategic objectives and creating long-term value. This commitment is reflected in our company's governing documents, our Amended and Restated Bylaws, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and the governing documents of each of the Board's committees. 
Our Board believes that its optimal leadership structure may change over time to reflect our company's evolving needs, strategy, and operating environment; changes in our Board's composition and leadership needs; and other factors, including the perspectives of stockholders and other stakeholders. Accordingly, each year the Board reviews and discusses the appropriate Board leadership structure, including the considerations described above. Based on that assessment and stockholder feedback, our Board believes that the existing structure, with Mr. Stuewe as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and Mr. Macaluso as Lead Director, is the optimal leadership framework at this time. As a highly regulated global ingredients company for food, feed and fuel, we and our stockholders benefit from an executive Chairman with deep experience in and knowledge of the ingredients industry, our company, and its businesses, and a strong Lead Director with robust, well-defined duties. Our Chairman, as Chief Executive Officer, serves as the primary voice to articulate our strategy of long-term responsible growth, while our Lead Director, together with the other experienced, independent directors, instills objec-
 tive independent Board leadership, and effectively engages and oversees management, including by helping to establish our long-term strategy and regularly assessing its effectiveness. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board and each of its committees are involved in overseeing risk associated with our company. In its oversight role, the Board annually reviews our company's strategic plan, which addresses, among other things, the risks and opportunities facing our company. Throughout the year, management reviews any critical issues and actual results compared to the plan with the Board and relevant Board committees. In addition, members of senior management are also available to discuss our company's strategy, plans, results and issues with the Board and Board committees, and regularly attend Board meetings to provide periodic briefings, including with respect to cybersecurity and environmental, health and safety matters. While the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, it has delegated certain risk management oversight responsibilities to the Board committees, as set forth in their respective charters. One of the primary purposes of the audit committee, as set forth in its charter, is to act on behalf of the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to oversee company processes for the management of business/financial risk and for compliance with applicable legal, ethical and regulatory requirements. Accordingly, as part of its responsibilities as set forth in its charter, the audit committee is charged with (i) inquiring of management and our company's outside auditors about significant risks and exposures and assessing the steps management has taken or needs to take to minimize such risks and (ii) overseeing our company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including the development and maintenance of an internal audit function to provide management and the audit committee with ongoing assessments of our company's risk management processes and internal controls. In connection with these risk oversight responsibilities, the audit committee has regular meetings with our company's management, internal auditors, chief compliance officer and independent, outside auditors. The nominating and corporate governance committee periodically reviews our company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and their implementation, as well as regularly evaluating new and continuing directors for election to the Board. The compensation committee considers risks related to the attraction and retention of talented senior management and other employees as well as risks relating to the design of compensation programs and arrangements. Each committee provides the Board with regular, detailed reports regarding committee meetings and actions. In addition, our company employs a chief compliance officer who provides regular updates to the audit committee on compliance related matters, as well as a chief risk officer who reports directly to our CEO with respect to risk management and provides regular updates and reports to our CEO and Board regarding all of our company's commodity risk positions.

Code of Business Conduct 
The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct to which all officers, directors and employees, who for purposes of the Code of Conduct are collectively referred to as employees, are required to adhere in addressing the legal and ethical issues encountered in conducting their work. The Code of Conduct requires that all employees avoid conflicts of interest, comply with all laws, rules and regulations, conduct business in an honest and fair manner, and otherwise act with integrity. Employees are required to report any violations of the Code of Conduct and may do so anonymously through our global Internet and telephone information and reporting service. The Code of Conduct includes specific provisions applicable to Darling's principal executive officer and senior financial officers. 
The Code of Conduct also addresses our company's procedures with respect to the review and approval of "related party transactions" that are required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations. The Code of Conduct provides that any transaction or activity, in which Darling is involved, with a "related party" (which is defined as an employee's child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law,daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of an employee of ours, or any entity that is either wholly or substantially owned or controlled by an employee of ours or any of the foregoing persons and any trust of which an employee of ours is a trustee or beneficiary) shall be subject to review by our general counsel so that appropriate measures can be put into place to avoid either an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Any waivers of this conflict of interest policy must be in writing and be pre-approved by our general counsel.

PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Nominees 
Director Nomination Process 
The Board is responsible for approving nominees for election as directors. To assist in this task, the nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending nominees to the Board. This committee is comprised solely of independent directors as defined by the rules of the NYSE and the SEC. 
The Board has a policy of considering director nominees recommended by our stockholders. A stockholder who wishes to recommend a prospective Board nominee for the nominating and corporate governance committee's consideration can write to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o Secretary, Darling Ingredients Inc., P.O. Box 141481, Irving, Texas 75014-1481. In addition to considering nominees recommended by stockholders, our nominating and corporate governance committee also considers prospective Board nominees recommended by current directors, management and other sources. Our nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates all prospective Board nominees in the same manner regardless of the source of the recommendation. 
As part of the nomination process, our nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board periodically the appropriate skills and characteristics required of directors in the context of the current make-up of the Board. This assessment includes issues of judgment, diversity, experience and skills. In evaluating prospective nominees, including nominees recommended by stockholders, our nominating and corporate governance committee looks for the following minimum qualifications, qualities and skills: 
As set forth above, our nominating and corporate governance committee considers diversity as one of a number of factors in identifying nominees for director. It does not, however, have a formal policy in this regard. The committee views diversity broadly to include diversity of experience, skills and viewpoint as well as traditional diversity concepts such as race, national origin and gender. The committee considers its current practice to be effective in identifying nominees for director who are able to contribute to the Board from diverse points of view. 
Stockholders who wish to submit a proposal for inclusion of a nominee for director in our proxy materials must also comply with the deadlines and requirements of our Amended and Restated Bylaws and of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act promulgated by the SEC. Please see "Additional Information" in this Proxy Statement for more information regarding the procedures for submission by a stockholder of a director nominee or other proposals. 
Required Vote 
To be elected, each nominee for director must receive a majority of all votes cast (assuming a quorum is present) with respect to that nominee's election. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" will not be counted as a vote cast with respect to a nominee.

Executive Overview 
COMPANY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Our Business 
Our company is a global developer and producer of sustainable natural ingredients from edible and inedible bio-nutrients, creating a wide range of ingredients and customized specialty solutions for customers in the pharmaceutical, food, pet food, feed, industrial, fuel, bioenergy, and fertilizer industries. With operations on five continents, the company collects and transforms all aspects of animal by-product streams into usable and specialty ingredients, such as collagen, edible fats, feed-grade fats, animal proteins and meals, plasma, pet food ingredients, organic fertilizers, yellow grease, fuel feedstocks, green energy, natural casings and hides. The company also recovers and converts recycled oils (used cooking oil and animal fats) into valuable feed and fuel ingredients, and collects and processes residual bakery products into feed ingredients. In addition, the company provides environmental services, such as grease trap collection and disposal services to food service establishments. Our operations are organized into three segments: Feed Ingredients, Fuel Ingredients and Food Ingredients. Our Fuel Ingredients segment includes our share of the results of our equity investment in Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC ("DGD"), a joint venture with Valero Energy Corporation, to convert animal fats, recycled greases, used cooking oil, inedible corn oil, soybean oil, or other feedstocks that become economically and commercially viable into renewable diesel, a biomass-based fuel that is interchangeable with petroleum-based diesel fuel but has a carbon lifecycle low enough to meet the most stringent low-carbon fuel standards.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
2018 Business Highlights 
Fiscal 2018 presented a challenging operating environment, as our business continued to experience the impacts of a continued multi-year deflationary cycle within the agriculture sector and continued pricing pressure from increased global supplies of grains, proteins and oilseeds. Despite these challenging operating conditions, we continued to successfully execute on our strategy to de-lever and to achieve operational and financial improvements intended to stabilize and grow profitability in businesses and geographic areas where sustainable and predictable margins can be achieved, as exemplified by the following: 
2018 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS

Realigned Capital Structure for Operating Conditions and Future Growth 
Pay for Performance 
The committee has designed our executive compensation program to deliver pay in alignment with corporate, business unit and individual performance primarily based on the following three factors, which in turn are expected to align executive pay with returns to stockholders over time: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Expansion of our company, both organically and through acquisitions, as well as through investments, such as DGD, within the  context of the business cycle, as our scale creates the platform for future growth and influences the stability of our companys earnings;

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Our effectiveness in deploying capital when compared to our Performance Peer Group (as defined on page 33 below); and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     The total shareholder return of our company as compared to our Performance Peer Group.  
[END TABLE]
Pricing of our finished products is heavily influenced by global grain and oilseed supplies, meat production trends, crude oil pricing and foreign currency values. We have diversified our business significantly during the last few years and remain a growth-oriented company focused on creating long-term value for our stockholders. However, deflationary cycles within the global commodity markets can have a significant impact on the price of our common stock, as it did in 2015. As such, we believe that the current best indicator of our long-term performance versus our Performance Peer Group is a comparison of how competitively we deploy capital versus our Performance Peer Group as measured by a return on capital standard. The other primary factor in aligning our pay and performance is whether we have remained a growth-oriented company as measured by EBITDA, which is also the numerator for return on capital. 
Performance against pre-established EBITDA goals was a key element of our 2018 annual incentive plan. In the last several years, we have used key acquisitions and a joint venture project to transform our platform and build future value through segment and product diversification and global expansion. EBITDA growth exceeding that of the median of our Performance Peer Group will result in greater annual incentive plan payouts, while shortfalls in EBITDA will result in below target payouts. As the chart below indicates, our CEO's total realizable compensation is well-aligned with our EBITDA performance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  For comparison purposes, 2016 Proforma Adjusted Combined EBITDA (non-GAAP) is also  shown using 2014 exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our company had no material foreign  operations prior to fiscal 2014, which is the year that our company acquired our Darling Ingredients International businesses from VION Holding, N.V.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  For comparison purposes, 2017 Proforma Adjusted Combined EBITDA (non-GAAP) is also  shown using 2014 exchange rates, which results in an increase of $50.8 million in EBITDA, and including $92.9 million in EBITDA attributable to DGD and our North American biofuel operations that relates to 2017 performance. The  $92.9 million in EBITDA relates to U.S. blenders tax credits for which DGD and our company are eligible, which for fiscal 2017 were not retroactively approved by Congress until February 2018. Although this $92.9 million in EBITDA is not  included in the company's or DGD's 2017 financial statements, since it directly related to 2017 performance and was included in the company's internal 2017 operating plan, in accordance with the annual incentive plan it was included  for purposes of determining the achievement level of adjusted EBITDA used to calculate the payouts under the 2017 annual incentive plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  For comparison purposes, 2018 Proforma Adjusted Combined EBITDA (non-GAAP) is also  shown using 2014 exchange rates, which results in an increase of $33.3 million in EBITDA, and excludes the $92.9 million in EBITDA related to U.S. blenders tax credits attributable to DGD and our North American biofuel operations that was  received in 2018 but relates to 2017 performance, as further described above. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, Congress had not yet acted to reinstate the blenders tax credit for calendar year 2018. Should Congress retroactively reinstate the  blenders tax credit for 2018 at its historic level of $1.00 per gallon, this would result in an additional estimated $87.4 million in EBITDA related to 2018 performance ($8.7 million attributable to Darling's North American biofuel operations  and $78.7 million attributable to Darling's share of DGD), which would result in a supplemental payment to the participants under the 2018 annual incentive program. For more information, see "Components of Fiscal 2018 Executive  Compensation Program – Annual Incentive Compensation – 2018 Performance Results and Award Payouts" contained later in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the Proxy Statement beginning on page 39.

Realizable pay reflects the actual cash and intrinsic value of equity incentives awarded in a given year, using the stock price at the end of the year. For example, for 2018, realizable pay equals base salary plus annual incentives earned for 2018 performance plus options granted on January 29, 2018 and shares to be issued in the first quarter of 2021, assuming target PSU performance for 2018 to 2020 for PSUs awarded on January 29, 2018, plus the reported Summary Compensation Table values for Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings and All Other Compensation.

We have used a return on capital standard as the performance measure under our long-term incentive ("LTI") program since 2010. As in 2017, for 2018, we used return on capital employed (as defined, "ROCE") as the performance metric for our LTI program, together with a relative total shareholder return ("TSR") modifier. Our compensation committee believes, given the substantial growth of our company over the last ten years, that ROCE most appropriately measures our ongoing operating performance against peers because it excludes goodwill from the calculation and thereby focuses on the value of a particular asset and the working capital needed to operate that asset. Our return on capital targets are set to reflect the median historical performance levels for our Performance Peer Group. The following chart shows that by aligning our executive compensation with EBITDA and capital deployment performance, with a TSR modifier, the realizable pay levels provided by our executive compensation program to our CEO are aligned to our stock price performance over the long-term:

The committee believes that our executive compensation program effectively aligns pay with performance based on the key factors discussed above, thereby aligning executive pay with returns to stockholders and creating a growth-oriented, long-term value proposition for our stockholders. 
SAY ON PAY ADVISORY VOTE RESULTS AND STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS 
We have conducted a stockholder engagement process for the past several years and routinely interact with stockholders throughout the year about executive compensation and other matters. Stockholders are also provided an annual opportunity to provide feedback through an advisory say on pay vote on executive compensation. For 2016, our executive compensation program was significantly redesigned in response to stockholder feedback and say on pay results. At our 2017 and 2018 Annual Meetings, approximately 98.6% and 97.1%, respectively, of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. Additionally, in 2018, members of the committee and management reached out to stockholders representing approximately 75% of our outstanding shares and held direct conversations with every stockholder who responded to our engagement request. Overall, we spoke with stockholders representing approximately 38.5% of our outstanding shares, with the chairman of our compensation committee leading the discussions. In the past four years, as part of our ongoing stockholder engagement process, the chairman of our compensation committee, together with members of senior management, have spoken with stockholders representing a substantial portion of our outstanding shares, as well as two different proxy advisory firms. These discussions, together with the 2017 and 2018 say on pay results, indicated strong support for our significantly redesigned executive compensation program and influenced the committee's decision to maintain a consistent overall approach for 2018 and 2019. Stockholder engagement and the outcome of the say on pay vote results will continue to inform future compensation decisions.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
The committee has designed our executive compensation program to deliver pay in alignment with corporate, business unit and individual performance. A large portion of total direct compensation is "at-risk" through long-term equity awards and annual cash incentive awards. These awards are linked to actual performance and include a significant portion of equity. See charts on page 35 for more information regarding the target annual compensation mix for our CEO and other NEOs. 
Fiscal 2018 Compensation Actions at a Glance 
A substantial amount of the NEOs' fiscal 2018 compensation was in the form of annual and long-term incentives, providing, as in prior years, a strong incentive to increase stockholder value. 80% of our CEO's and 65% of the other NEOs' annual target total direct compensation was performance-based. The following summarizes the key compensation decisions for the NEOs for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Base Salary: The committee approved base salary increases in 2018 for each of our  NEOs. Mr. Stuewe received a 9% increase over the prior year, while certain of the other NEOs received larger percentage increases due to promotions and increases in responsibility.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Annual Incentive Bonus: In fiscal 2018, the Company achieved global adjusted  EBITDA of approximately 94.9% of target, and each of our NEOs achieved a substantial amount of their strategic, operational and personal (SOP) goals. As a result, Mr. Stuewe earned a 2018 annual incentive bonus equal to about 81.2%  of his target and the other NEOs earned payouts ranging from about 72.7% to 186.2% of target.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
◾    Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Awards: As in the prior year, LTI awards had a target  grant date value of 60% of the annual target total compensation for our CEO and 44% of the annual target total compensation for each of our other NEOs, and were delivered through a target value mix of performance share units (PSUs) (60%) tied to  three-year, forward looking performance and stock options (40%).  
[END TABLE]
These compensation decisions are discussed in more detail in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and shown in the Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table that follow. 
Compensation Program Objectives and Philosophy 
The committee has designed our executive compensation program to serve several key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
:=n     attract and retain superior employees in key positions, with compensation opportunities that are competitive relative to the  compensation paid to similarly-situated executives at companies similar to us by generally setting target levels of annual total direct compensation opportunity for the NEOs at or near the 50th percentile of target total compensation for similarly  situated executives at an identified group of peer companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
:=n     reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
:=n     align the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders by placing a significant portion of total direct compensation  at risk (80% for our CEO), and rewarding performance that exceeds that of our peer companies, through the use of equity-based LTI awards and a share ownership and retention policy, with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value over  time.

ROLES OF COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS 
Compensation Committee 
The committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our executive compensation program. The Board appoints the members of the committee. Each member of the committee is an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, the Board has determined that each member of the committee meets the applicable requirements for independence established by applicable SEC rules and the listing standards of the NYSE. The committee: 
The committee meets on a regular basis and generally without members of management present. The committee's duties and responsibilities are described in its charter, which can be found on our website at http://ir.darlingii.com/corporate-governance-documents. The committee and the Board periodically review and, as appropriate, revise the charter. 
As provided by its charter and discussed in greater detail below, the committee engages an independent compensation consultant to advise it on the design of our executive compensation program. As in the prior year, the committee engaged Pearl Meyer to advise it in connection with the 2018 executive compensation program. To determine the appropriate compensation levels, the committee

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis considers, in conjunction with information on market pay levels, practices and trends from its independent compensation consultant: 
The committee periodically reviews our executive compensation program to ensure that it remains competitive and provides the proper balance between cash and equity, and between short-term and long-term incentive compensation. The committee's regular analysis and refinement of the compensation program ensures continuing alignment of the elements of the compensation program with our company's business strategy and stockholder interests. During this process, the committee: 
In addition to its responsibilities for executive compensation plans and programs, the committee also reviews and evaluates from time to time our director compensation plans, policies and programs and reports its findings to the nominating and corporate governance committee, and reviews compensation and benefit plans, policies and programs for management and other employees, as appropriate. 
Role of Chief Executive Officer 
The committee annually evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer who, in turn, on an annual basis, reviews the performance of his direct reports, which include each of the NEOs other than himself. The Chief Executive Officer presents his conclusions and recommendations with respect to performance and pay, including recommendations with respect to base salary adjustments and level of achievement of incentive goals, to the committee. The committee considers this information and then exercises its judgment in adopting or modifying any recommended adjustments or awards to be made to the NEOs. 
Use of an Independent Compensation Consultant 
The committee's charter allows the committee to engage an independent compensation consultant to advise the committee on the design of our executive compensation. As in the prior year, for fiscal 2018, the committee engaged Pearl Meyer, an independent executive compensation consulting firm, to counsel the committee on various factors relating to the development of our 2018 executive compensation program. 
Pearl Meyer is engaged directly by, and is fully accountable to, the committee. The committee has determined, after considering independence factors provided by the SEC and the NYSE, that Pearl Meyer does not have any conflicts of interest that would prevent them from being objective. 
Use of Peer Companies in Setting Executive Compensation and Measuring Performance 
Purpose 
The committee uses peer groups for the following purposes: 
For purposes of making decisions with respect to the 2018 executive compensation program, we used two different peer groups to evaluate the competitiveness of pay levels and to establish performance standards. The committee believes that it is appropriate to

[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis use companies that are generally similar in size to our company for pay comparisons (the "Pay Levels Peer Group"). For performance comparisons, however, the committee believes it is appropriate to use a broader peer group that is not limited by size or location to set the standards for long-term incentive plan performance, as company size and location do not materially influence performance comparisons (the "Performance Peer Group"). Although the committee is referencing two different peer groups, there is substantial overlap between the peer groups due to 14 companies being present in both peer groups, as shown in the table that follows. 
The committee uses competitive pay information derived from the Pay Levels Peer Group to generally inform its compensation decisions, but does not formulaically benchmark based on this data. The committee generally sets target levels of annual total direct compensation for the NEOs at or near the 50th percentile of target total compensation levels offered to similarly-situated executives at the peer companies. Variations from the 50th percentile level may occur due to the experience level of the individual and market factors, as well as performance that is significantly above or below goals. 
Our company has a unique variety of product offerings and derives income from disparate industries. Therefore, it is difficult to establish a group of peer companies for measuring the competitiveness of our compensation opportunities and for measuring our relative business performance. In particular, it is challenging to identify appropriate peers for our business performance among companies in our S&P 8-digit and 6-digit Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) codes, as many of the companies in those GICS codes that are of roughly similar size manufacture, market, and distribute food for human consumption. These companies typically use agricultural commodities as ingredients in their products, and as a result these companies would typically experience reduced performance when these commodity prices rise. In contrast, our products are ingredients that our customers use in their products, and are not generally for human consumption. Our product prices generally track the performance of an identified group of agricultural commodities. As those agricultural commodities prices rise, our financial performance will generally improve, and conversely, as those commodities prices fall, our financial performance will generally be negatively impacted. As a result, our company tends to operate in opposite economic cycles from many of the other food or agricultural-related companies in our general GICS codes. 
In light of these challenges, the committee uses two peer groups – one to assess the company's performance with respect to annual and long-term incentive plans (the Performance Peer Group) and a second to assess executive compensation opportunities (the Pay Levels Peer Group). Notably, at the time that the committee approved the design of the 2018 executive compensation program, 70% of the companies in the Pay Levels Peer Group were also members of the Performance Peer Group. The committee reviews the peer groups annually to determine whether any changes should be made to the members of the peer groups. Members of the Performance Peer Group and Pay Levels Peer Group used for the 2018 executive compensation program are listed below.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Performance Peer Group 
To better reflect the company's operating segments of Feed, Food, and Fuel and who we compete with for employee talent and capital, the Performance Peer Group was established for purposes of evaluating our performance under the company's incentive programs. In selecting the Performance Peer Group constituents, the committee considered the following criteria: (i) industry, (ii) business operations similar to those of the company, focused on Feed, Food, and/or Fuel, (iii) the extent to which operations were global, (iv) company size, as measured by revenues and market capitalization, and (v) availability of publicly disclosed financial information. 
Pay Levels Peer Group 
In establishing the Pay Levels Peer Group and in order to create as much overlap with the Performance Peer Group as possible, the committee first identified those companies within the Performance Peer Group that (i) were U.S.-based companies and (ii) were similar in size to us, as measured by revenues using the parameters of between one-third and three times our estimated revenues. As 14 companies from the Performance Peer Group met those size criteria, in order to ensure that the peer group was of sufficient size to perform compensation comparisons that were not overly influenced by any one company, the committee worked with its independent compensation consultant at the time to identify six other companies that were U.S.-based, similar in size and industry, and subject to similar cyclicality and volatility as the company. The committee believes that this peer group is a reasonable peer group that is comprised of similarly sized companies with operations similar to those of our company and/or influenced by similar cyclicality and volatility. 
Changes to Peer Groups for Fiscal 2019 and Beyond 
During fiscal 2018, the committee undertook its annual review of the peer groups to determine whether any changes should be made to the members of the peer groups for fiscal 2019 and beyond. Among the factors considered by the committee were the loss of certain members of the peer groups and changes to the company's businesses and business mix since the peer groups were originally identified. As a result of this review, the committee determined that the composition of the current peer groups was still generally appropriate; however, the committee did make a few changes to the composition, resulting in the peer groups for fiscal 2019 shown in the table below.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Fiscal 2018 Compensation Components—Details 
BASE SALARY 
Our company provides NEOs with a base salary to compensate them for services rendered during each fiscal year. Base salary ranges for NEOs are determined for each executive based on his position and responsibility by using market data supplied by the committee's independent compensation consultant. Base salary is designed to be competitive when compared with the Pay Levels Peer Group. The committee periodically reviews base salaries of senior executives, including the NEOs, to determine if adjustment is necessary based on competitive practices and economic conditions. Base salary for senior executives will also be reviewed and adjustment may be made based on individual performance and the individual's skills, experience and background, or in connection with a promotion or other change in responsibilities. For 2018, the committee conducted a review of the base salaries of each of the NEOs, taking into account market data supplied by Pearl Meyer, the committee's independent compensation consultant. Based on this review, each of the NEOs received an increase in base salary for 2018. In the case of Mr. Stuewe, this represented the second consecutive year to receive an increase in base salary, following two years with no increase to base salary. In addition, the committee noted Mr. Stuewe's continued successful execution on our strategy to de-lever the company while continuing to grow our businesses, despite operating in a continued multi-year deflationary cycle within the agriculture sector and continued pricing pressure on commodities. Mr. Phillips' increase in base salary reflects his significant increase in responsibilities based on his promotion to the position of Executive Vice President 
 – Chief Financial Officer in January 2018, Mr. van der Velden's increase took into account the additional responsibilities he assumed with the retirement of Mr. Kloosterboer in October 2017, and Mr. Vervoort's increase reflects his significant increase in responsibilities based on his promotion to the position of Executive Vice President – Rousselot in May 2017. 
The chart below summarizes how fiscal 2018 base salaries compare to fiscal 2017 base salaries for each of our NEOs.

ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 
Overview 
To motivate performance, each of our NEOs was provided with an annual incentive award opportunity for fiscal 2018 tied to (i) global and/or regional/business line EBITDA goals and (ii) the performance of the individual with respect to key SOP goals. The range of award payouts that an executive could earn (0% to 200% of target), as well as the performance goals, were established at the beginning of the year. Additional detail with respect to the design of the fiscal 2018 annual incentive program is provided below. 
Annual Incentive Award Formula 
In determining payouts under the fiscal 2018 annual incentive program, the committee used the following formula for the NEOs:

Annual Incentive Plan Performance Metrics and Range of Performance 
For fiscal 2018 (as in fiscal 2017), the committee continued to measure financial performance based on a targeted level of EBITDA compared to the Performance Peer Group. The committee continued to balance the financial objectives of the organization with strategic, operational and personal objectives. These objectives are closely tied to the company's performance in other key areas of the business that drive stockholder value creation and focus executives on areas over which they have the most direct impact. Additional detail with respect to the performance metrics and range of performance is provided below. 
EBITDA (65% weighting): 65% of each NEO's payout was tied to a targeted level of EBITDA performance for fiscal 2018. Depending on the NEO's responsibilities, EBITDA was measured at the global level or in a mix of global and regional/business line results. 
The committee selected global and/or regional/business line EBITDA as the sole annual financial performance metric because (i) EBITDA is one element of ROCE, which is a performance metric that is well understood internally, (ii) incenting the achievement of a targeted level of EBITDA is closely aligned with continued stockholder value creation, and (iii) EBITDA provides a separate metric from that used in our long-term incentive plan, while continuing to motivate performance that is tied to stockholder value creation. Based on those factors, the committee concluded that a targeted level of EBITDA was the most appropriate annual financial performance metric. 
To focus executives on areas over which they have the most direct impact and motivate controllable performance, EBITDA was measured as follows: 
The pre-defined calculation of EBITDA is subject to adjustment by the committee for certain one-time, unusual or extraordinary items in order to more fairly assess our company's performance for executive compensation purposes. These adjustments for compensation purposes may differ from the adjustments included in the company's reported adjusted EBITDA. For fiscal 2018, these committee adjustments consisted of approximately $10.8 million in impairment charges relating to the closure or sale of certain of our operations in Argentina, Europe and the United States. In addition, adjusted EBITDA includes our company's portion of the EBITDA from our DGD joint venture, which is treated as an unconsolidated subsidiary in our financial statements but is a high performing asset and considered an important part of our strategy because it provides a significant market and enhanced margins for our fats and oils and thereby a hedge to offset commodity exposure in our Feed Ingredients segment. Financial performance measures are adjusted to reflect budgeted levels of currency exchange in order to properly measure job performance, as our company is an operating company and not in the business of trading currencies. 
In developing the 2018 annual EBITDA goals, target level performance was set by determining the EBITDA that would be achieved assuming ROCE performance for the prior fiscal year at the 50th percentile relative to our Performance Peer Group. These goals generally require a high level of performance to be achieved over the one-year period. Threshold and maximum levels are set as a percentage of target and are designed to provide a smaller award for lower levels of acceptable performance (threshold) as well as to reward exceptional levels of performance (maximum).

Strategic, Operational and Personal Goals (35% weighting): Each of our NEOs also had SOP goals for fiscal 2018 that were tied to short- and long-term strategic objectives within the company. The SOPs were a blend of quantitative and qualitative goals for each NEO set at the beginning of the performance period, with a varying number of goals and weighting of those goals for each executive. The SOPs for our CEO and each of the other NEOs are reviewed and approved by the committee. The CEO makes

Compensation Discussion and Analysis recommendations to the committee on the SOPs for NEOs other than himself. The SOPs with respect to fiscal 2018 addressed items such as: 
At the end of the fiscal year, the CEO submits to the committee a performance self-assessment and conducts a final review with each of the other NEOs and rates their performance. The CEO then submits to the committee a performance assessment for each of the other NEOs. These assessments consider completion of objectives and the quality of work performed, and incorporate an element of judgment in assigning individual levels of achievement. A maximum payout of 200% of the target for the SOP component is possible for exceptional performance. 
2018 Performance Results and Award Payouts 
For fiscal 2018, we achieved global adjusted EBITDA of approximately $527.1 million, which was approximately 94.9% of the target EBITDA and which resulted in award payouts equal to approximately 74.4% of target payout on the global EBITDA portion of the performance goal. This amount excludes $92.9 million in EBITDA relating to U.S. blenders tax credits ("BTCs") attributable to DGD and our North American biofuel operations which related to 2017 performance but was not included in the company's or DGD's financial statements until the first quarter of 2018, but which was included in the adjusted EBITDA used to calculate the annual incentive payouts for fiscal 2017. As a biodiesel blender, DGD, as well as the company's own North American biodiesel operations, are eligible to receive a U.S. BTC. Although the BTC expired on December 31, 2016, in February 2018 it was retroactively reinstated by Congress for calendar year 2017. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, Congress had not yet acted to reinstate the BTC for calendar year 2018. In the event that Congress does subsequently approve the retroactive reinstatement of the BTC for calendar year 2018, the participants in the 2018 annual incentive program will receive at that time any additional amount that would have been payable under the 2018 annual incentive program after taking into account the increased EBITDA relating to 2018 performance resulting from the reinstated BTC. 
In addition, based on the committee's review of the performance assessments of our NEOs, the following achievement percentages were assigned for the SOPs: 93.75% for Mr. Stuewe; 83.75% for Mr. Phillips; 88.75% for Mr. Elrod; 90% for Mr. van der Velden; and 100% for Mr. Vervoort.

Overview 
Each of our NEOs was provided with long-term incentive award opportunities for fiscal 2018 that were tied to our performance. The principal objectives of the LTI design are to (i) motivate our NEOs to drive sustained long-term stockholder value creation, (ii) grant award opportunities that are based on the competitive market, but then adjusted for our performance, (iii) provide the NEOs with equity ownership opportunities that will further enhance their alignment with our stockholders' interests and (iv) serve as an important retention tool. The committee believes that providing long-term equity-based awards incentivizes executives to balance short- and long-term decisions, which helps to mitigate excessive risk-taking by our executives. Under our LTI program first put in place in 2016, grants are generally made in the first quarter of each year; however, in limited, special situations, equity awards may be granted at other times to attract new executives and to retain existing executives. No such special awards were granted to any NEOs during 2018. 
For 2016 and beyond, after reviewing trends in executive compensation and pay-related governance policies and in response to the results of our say on pay votes and stockholder feedback, the committee made significant changes to the company's LTI program. As illustrated in the charts below, under our current LTI program, participants receive (i) annual, overlapping grants of PSUs tied to three-year, forward-looking performance based on average return on capital employed (ROCE) relative to our Performance Peer Group and (ii) annual stock option grants that vest 33-1/3% on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd anniversaries of grant. LTI target level performance for the PSUs is based upon achievement of 50th percentile ROCE performance relative to our Performance Peer Group, subject to adjustment by a total shareholder return (TSR) modifier that reduces (or increases) the number of PSUs earned if TSR relative to our Performance Peer Group ranks near the bottom (or near the top). 
For performance between the 30th and 80th percentiles, the number of PSUs earned will be interpolated between threshold-target and target-maximum. 
The committee views this program to be aligned with the objectives of motivating and rewarding executives for performance on key long-term measures, while also promoting retention of executive talent, and the program is well-designed to drive stockholder value creation and focus executives on areas over which they have the most direct impact. 
Additional detail with respect to the design of the long-term incentive program is provided below.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Mix of Equity Awards 
Under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the committee may grant various types of equity-based awards. As in the prior year, the committee provided long-term incentives for fiscal 2018 to the NEOs through a target value mix of stock options (40%) and PSUs (60%). The committee, with input from its independent compensation consultant, believes that this mix is consistent with market practice for these types of awards. 
Stock Options. Stock option awards reflect the pay for performance principles of our executive compensation program by directly linking long-term incentives to stock price appreciation. Stock options require stock price appreciation to deliver value to an executive. We determined the January 2018 grant of nonqualified stock options by converting 40% of the target LTI value for each NEO to a number of stock options using an estimated Black-Scholes option value. Stock options were granted to each NEO, and other eligible management employees, and the exercise price of such options was established on January 29, 2018. All of the options granted to our NEOs are nonqualified stock options with ten-year terms that vest in one-third increments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Information regarding the grant date fair value and the number of stock options awarded in 2018 under the 2018 LTI program to each of our NEOs is set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 46. 
Performance Share Unit Awards. PSUs are tied to our company's long-term performance to ensure that our NEOs' pay is directly linked to the achievement of sustained long-term operating performance. Reflective of the desire to balance prudent use of capital and returns to our stockholders, the committee has determined that awards will be earned based on our ROCE relative to our Performance Peer Group for a three-year, forward-looking cycle. Awards based on ROCE are also subject to potential adjustment based on our TSR relative to the Performance Peer Group over the same period. Dividend equivalent units related to PSUs will be accrued and paid in company stock at the same time as PSUs, but only if and to the extent PSUs are earned. 
As in the prior year, for purposes of the 2018 executive compensation program, ROCE was determined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
ROCE   =      earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)   ÷   CAPITAL EMPLOYED   where   CAPITAL EMPLOYED   =   the sum of (i) current assets (excluding cash) less current  liabilities (excluding the current portion of any long-term debt), plus (ii) gross property, plant and equipment (including gross intangibles but excluding goodwill), plus (iii) equity in nonconsolidated subsidiaries 
ROCE   =      earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)   ÷   CAPITAL EMPLOYED   where   CAPITAL EMPLOYED   =   the sum of (i) current assets (excluding cash) less current  liabilities (excluding the current portion of any long-term debt), plus (ii) gross property, plant and equipment (including gross intangibles but excluding goodwill), plus (iii) equity in nonconsolidated subsidiaries 
[END TABLE]
In addition, under our executive compensation program, the committee adjusts the ROCE performance results (or components thereof) to exclude the impact of extraordinary, unusual or unanticipated events, such as acquisitions, divestitures or mergers, stock splits or stock dividends or other similar material circumstances affecting or with respect to our company or any member of the Performance Peer Group during the performance period. The committee determines whether any such adjustment is appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the PSUs with the goal of fairly comparing our company's performance with the performance of the companies in the Performance Peer Group over the performance period. 
TSR is defined for purposes of the PSUs as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
TSR   =    cumulative amount of dividends for the performance period, assuming dividend reinvestment   +    the  increase or decrease in the Average Stock Price from the first day of the performance period to the last day of the performance period   ÷    the  Average Stock Price determined as of the first day of the performance period   where   Average Stock Price is the average of the closing transaction prices of a  share of our common stock, as reported on the NYSE, for 20 trading days immediately preceding the date for which the average stock price is being determined

The committee selected ROCE and TSR as the performance measures for the PSUs because they:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
In addition, the committee believes that, given the substantial growth of our company over the last ten years, the use of ROCE is the most appropriate measure of our company's operating performance against its peers, since it excludes goodwill from the calculation and thereby better focuses on the value of a particular asset and the working capital needed to operate that asset.

2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
As previously mentioned, the committee decided to deliver 60% of the target LTI value in PSUs. The chart below summarizes the target LTI awards for the NEOs for fiscal 2018. Information regarding the fair market value and number of PSUs that the NEOs may earn at the end of the 2018-2020 performance period, subject to the performance metrics described above, is shown in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 46. The starting value for the award, however, does not represent the actual compensation the NEOs will realize. These awards are intended to focus the NEOs on future company performance, and the actual value realized by an NEO will depend on our performance over time and the NEO's continued employment with our company.

2016-2018 PSU Award Determinations 
Following the end of a PSU performance cycle, the committee reviews and certifies the performance attained based on our reported audited financial statements, subject to the potential adjustments described above. Each PSU that vests is settled with a share of our common stock. 
In February 2019, the committee reviewed and certified achievement of the performance metrics for the PSUs granted in February 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period. Relative ROCE for this 3-year performance cycle was at the 54th percentile. In addition, relative TSR for this same period was at the 89th percentile.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Consequently, 149% of the target number of PSUs granted in February 2016 were earned. These results reflect two adjustments made by the committee for non-recurring charges or one-time events incurred by two different members of the Performance Peer Group during the performance period, one of which related to a one-time dividend and one of which related to an impairment charge taken as a result of the delay in the receipt of tax credits. 
 The performance scale and TSR modifier for the 2016-2018 cycle at threshold, target and maximum levels was the same as for the 2018-2020 cycle shown above. The value and number of PSUs that the NEOs earned for the 2016-2018 performance period are shown in the "Stock Awards" columns of the Option Exercises and Stock Vested Table on page 50. 
Other Features of Our Compensation Program 
RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES 
Retirement Benefits 
We do not provide special or supplemental retirement benefits to our NEOs. 
Our company offers a 401(k) plan to all of its eligible U.S.-based salaried employees. The 401(k) plan includes an employer contribution ranging from 3% to 6% of a participant's base salary, based on age, and a matching contribution of 25% of a participant's contributions up to 6% of a participant's base salary. Our company also maintains a Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan which was frozen effective December 31, 2011, and no future benefit will accrue after such date. Prior to December 31, 2011, participants accrued a benefit calculated on "average monthly pay" based upon the highest 60 consecutive months of the latest 120 months (and subject to certain limitations) and the years of service completed. 
Messrs. van der Velden and Vervoort participate in a pension arrangement for which all Darling Ingredients International Dutch employees in the Netherlands are eligible. The pension arrangement consists of both a defined benefit and a defined contribution arrangement. Participation in the pension arrangement is compulsory for all covered employees in the Netherlands. All covered employees contribute one-third to the overall pension arrangement costs as a fixed percentage of their salary. See the Pension Benefits Table included on page 51 of this proxy statement for additional details on the defined benefit portion of the arrangement. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
Our company provides NEOs with minimal perquisites and other personal benefits, generally in the form of a company automobile (or related allowance) and certain club dues, all as reflected in the All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table included on page 45 of this Proxy Statement. The committee believes these benefits are reasonable and consistent with our overall executive compensation program to better enable our company to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to NEOs to ensure they are reasonable and in line with market practices. 
EMPLOYMENT AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS 
Our company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Stuewe and Senior Executive Termination Benefits Agreements with Messrs. Phillips and Elrod, each of which provide for, among other things, potential payments and other benefits upon termination of employment for a variety of reasons. We have also entered into employment agreements with Messrs. van der Velden and Vervoort that include certain notice period requirements for any termination of employment. None of these agreements contain excise tax gross-up provisions related to potential change in control payments. 
Our company has no outstanding equity award agreements that include provisions automatically accelerating vesting upon a change in control (sometimes referred to as "single-trigger" vesting). Instead, the award agreements provide for vesting following a change in control only if there is also an involuntary termination (either by the company without cause or by the executive for good reason) within a stated period following the change in control, provided that the awards are assumed or replaced by the acquiring company. This is often referred to as "double-trigger" vesting, as it requires both a change in control (the first trigger) and a subsequent involuntary termination (the second trigger). 
See "Employment Agreements" and "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control" included elsewhere in this Proxy Statement for a description of these agreements, including the severance benefits thereunder. 
The committee believes that these severance arrangements are an important part of overall compensation for our NEOs and an important recruitment and retention tool as most of our competitors have implemented similar arrangements for their senior employees. Certain of these agreements include committee approved change of control provisions to provide reasonable personal protection to our senior executives in the context of an actual or potential change of control of our company. The committee views these arrangements as preventing management distraction during the critical periods prior to and immediately following a change of control.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
STOCK OWNERSHIP AND RETENTION POLICY 
Our company has stock ownership guidelines to further align the interests of our non-employee directors and NEOs with those of our stockholders. The guidelines require our NEOs and non-employee directors to maintain an investment in our common stock at the following levels: 
Each of the NEOs and non-employee directors must retain at least 75% of any shares of our common stock received in connection with incentive awards (after sales for the payment of taxes and shares withheld to cover the exercise price of stock options) until such person is in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines. In determining whether the required investment levels have been met, shares will be valued using the closing price of our common stock on the later of (i) the date(s) acquired, or (ii) March 23, 2011 (the date that the stock ownership guidelines were adopted). 
POLICY AGAINST HEDGING AND PLEDGING COMPANY STOCK 
The company has a policy that prohibits each NEO and non-employee director from (A) engaging in (i) short-term trading (generally defined as selling company securities within six months following the purchase), (ii) short sales, (iii) transactions involving derivatives, (iv) hedging transactions or (v) any other contractual derivative transactions, such as total return swaps and (B) holding company securities in a margin account or pledging company securities as collateral for a loan. 
COMPENSATION RECOVERY (CLAWBACK) 
We maintain a compensation recovery policy that goes beyond the policies currently required by law. Specifically, the policy requires each executive officer to reimburse the company for all or a portion of any annual or long-term incentive compensation paid to the executive officer based on achievement of financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement due to the executive's misconduct, to the extent determined by the Board. The Board may also determine to require the forfeiture of unvested awards, reduce future compensation or take other disciplinary actions (including termination of employment). The committee believes that this compensation recovery policy enhances our governance practices by creating direct financial costs to NEOs whose misconduct leads to a material financial restatement. 
In addition, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, upon restatement of our company's financial statements, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer would be required to reimburse us for any (i) bonuses, (ii) other incentive or equity-based compensation, and/or (iii) profits from stock sales, received in the 12-month period following the filing of financial statements that were later required to be restated due to their misconduct. Our company will also implement the incentive compensation "clawback" provisions mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 in accordance with the requirements of that Act as the method of their implementation becomes finalized by the stock exchanges. 
TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallows a tax deduction to publicly held corporations for annual compensation over $1,000,000 paid to certain "covered employees" of that corporation. The committee has historically taken and continues to take into consideration the tax deductibility of executive compensation when designing the company's executive compensation. However, the committee recognizes that tax deductibility is only one of many factors to be considered in the context of building an effective and efficient executive compensation program that attracts and retains qualified senior executives and furthers the interests of shareholders, and therefore the committee retains authority to approve payments of nondeductible compensation if the committee determines that it is in the best interest of our company to do so. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The compensation committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on that review and those discussions, the compensation committee recommends to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

In the case of the option awards column, represents the aggregate full grant date fair value  computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 of the stock option award granted to the named executive officers on January 29, 2018 under the 2018 LTI program. Amounts reported for these awards may not represent the amounts that the named  executive officers will actually realize from the awards. Whether, and to what extent, a named executive officer realizes value will depend on our company's actual operating performance, stock price fluctuations and the named executive  officer's continued employment. See "Components of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program – Long-Term Incentive Compensation" on page 40.

  2.  The amounts reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column reflect  the amounts earned and payable to each named executive officer for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, as the case may be, under the applicable annual incentive plan. For fiscal 2018, these amounts are the actual amounts earned under the awards described in  the fiscal 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on page 46. For fiscal 2018, payments under the annual incentive plan were calculated as described in "Components of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program – Annual Incentive  Compensation" on page 37.

  3.  The item for fiscal 2018 represents the change in the actuarial present value of the named executive officers'  accumulated benefits under the applicable retirement plan from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. This change is the difference between the fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 measurements of the present value, assuming that benefit is not paid  until age 62 for Messrs. Stuewe and Phillips and age 65 for Messrs. van der Velden and Vervoort. The change in pension value for Messrs. Stuewe, Phillips, van der Velden and Vervoort was negative—($16,186) for Mr. Stuewe, ($30,617) for  Mr. Phillips, ($59,091) for Mr. van der Velden and ($31,909) for Mr. Vervoort—due primarily to changes in interest rate assumptions. Under SEC rules, these negative amounts are not included in the Summary Compensation Table. Each  of these amounts was computed using the same assumptions used for financial statement reporting purposes under FAS 87, Employers' Accounting for Pensions as described in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements in our Annual  Report for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018.

  1.  Represents the range of annual cash incentive award opportunities pursuant to the annual incentive bonus component of the  2018 executive compensation program. The minimum potential payout for each of the named executive officers was zero. The threshold and target amounts assume achievement of 100% of the SOPs of the personal objective component of the annual incentive  bonus payable pursuant to the 2018 executive compensation program, while the maximum amount assumes achievement of 200% of the SOPs. The performance period began on December 31, 2017 and ended on December 29, 2018. Actual payments under  these awards have already been determined and paid and are included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the fiscal year 2018 Summary Compensation Table. For a detailed discussion of the  annual incentive bonus for fiscal year 2018, see "Components of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program – Annual Incentive Compensation" on page 37. Amounts shown for Mr. Phillips are on an annualized basis. Actual  payout of his award was calculated based on his promotion date of January 15, 2018. Amounts shown for Messrs. van der Velden and Vervoort are based on their annual base salary in fiscal 2018 of  €400,000 and €300,000, respectively, and have been converted to U.S. Dollars using the conversion rate of $1.181820 dollars per euro, which  is the full year average rate of the euro to the U.S. Dollar for 2018.

  3.  On January 29, 2018, our compensation committee granted stock options to the named executive officers pursuant to the  long-term incentive component of the 2018 executive compensation program. The exercise price of such stock options was determined based on the closing price of our company's common stock on the NYSE on the grant date of the options. The stock  options vest in three equal annual installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant and generally remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant. For a detailed discussion of the stock option awards,  see "Components of Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Program – Long-Term Incentive Compensation" on page 40.

  4.  This column shows the full grant date fair value of equity awards under FASB ASC Topic 718 granted to the named executive  officers in 2018. Generally, the full grant date fair value is the amount the Company would expense in its financial statements over the award's vesting schedule. For stock options, fair value is calculated based on the grant date fair values  estimated by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for financial purposes, $6.37 per option for the grants on January 29, 2018. See Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended  December 29, 2018 regarding assumptions underlying valuation of equity awards. Actual amounts ultimately realized by the named executive officers from the disclosed stock and option awards will likely vary based on a number of factors,  including the amounts of the actual awards, our operating performance, stock price fluctuations, differences from the valuation assumptions used and the timing of exercise or applicable vesting.

Pension Benefits 
The following table shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to each of the eligible named executive officers, including the number of years of service credited to each eligible named executive officer, under our Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan or Netherlands – PGB, former SPS Pension Plan, as applicable, determined using interest rate and post-retirement mortality rate assumptions. For Messrs. Stuewe and Phillips, these values are calculated assuming retirement at age 62, the earliest age at which a participant can receive an unreduced retirement benefit from our Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan. Our Salaried Employees' Retirement Plan was frozen effective December 31, 2011. For Messrs. van der Velden and Vervoort, these values are calculated assuming retirement at age 65 for benefits accrued up to January 1, 2014, age 67 for benefits accrued from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2017, and age 68 for benefits accrued from January 1, 2018. Information regarding both plans and the terms and conditions of payments and benefits available under the plans can be found under the heading "Other Features of our Compensation Program – Retirement Benefits and Perquisites" on page 43.

The present value of accumulated benefits has been calculated as of December 29, 2018, which is the measurement date for financial statement reporting purposes. The present value of accumulated benefits has been calculated assuming the retirement ages described above, and no pre-retirement death, disability, or withdrawal was assumed. All other assumptions used (including a 4.10% discount rate for Messrs. Stuewe and Phillips, a 2.40% discount rate for Messrs. van der Velden and Vervoort and a projection of the PFG2013-10 MI scale, which scale is based on the RPEC_2014_v2017 model reflecting historical U.S. mortality data to 2015, published by the Society of Actuaries in October of 2017, male and female, for Messrs. Stuewe and Phillips and the Prognosetafel AG 2016 with correction High-Middle for Messrs. van der Velden and Vervoort) are consistent with the assumptions used for our company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. See Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 for more information regarding the assumptions underlying the valuation of the pension benefits.

Subject to certain limited exceptions, settlement of the vested PSUs shall be effected in the form of issuance  of whole shares of our common stock to the recipient, within 90 days following the earlier to occur of (i) December 29, 2020 and (ii) the recipient's termination of service. The value of these awards is not included in the  Summary Compensation table for fiscal 2018 as the aggregate full grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 was included as compensation in the year the award was granted.

Pursuant to Mr. Stuewe's employment agreement, subject to certain exceptions, during Mr. Stuewe's employment with our company and for a period of (i) two years thereafter in the event of termination without cause, (ii) three years thereafter in the event of termination upon a change of control and (iii) one year thereafter in each other instance (the "Restricted Period"), Mr. Stuewe may not have any ownership interest in, or be an employee, salesman, consultant, officer or director of, any entity that engages in the United States, Canada or Mexico in a business that is similar to that in which our company is engaged in the territory. Subject to certain limitations, Mr. Stuewe's employment agreement also prohibits him from soliciting our company's customers, employees or consultants during the Restricted Period. Further, Mr. Stuewe is required by his employment agreement to keep all confidential information in confidence during his employment and at all times thereafter. 
Mr. Stuewe's employment agreement contains a provision that provides that in the event it shall be determined that any payment or distribution by our company to Mr. Stuewe or for his benefit would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 (or any successor provisions) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any interest or penalty is incurred by Mr. Stuewe with respect to such excise tax, then such payments shall be reduced (but not below zero) if and to the extent that such reduction would result in Mr. Stuewe retaining a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (taking into account federal, state and local income taxes and the imposition of the excise tax), than if Mr. Stuewe received all of such payments. The employment agreement provides that our company shall reduce or eliminate any such payments, by first reducing or eliminating the portion of such payments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments, in each case in reverse order beginning with payments or benefits which are to be paid the farthest in time from the determination. Additionally, Mr. Stuewe's employment agreement contains provisions intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance promulgated thereunder.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control 
As of the end of fiscal 2018, we had in effect Senior Executive Termination Benefits Agreements with each of Messrs. Phillips and Elrod, which provide that, subject to certain conditions, we must continue to pay the executive upon any termination of his employment (except termination by reason of the voluntary resignation, termination for cause or termination by reason of normal retirement) for one year (i) his annual base salary in effect at the time of his termination (the "Termination Payment Amount"), (ii) any accrued vacation pay due but not yet taken at the date of his termination, and (iii) life, disability, health and dental insurance, and certain other similar benefits of our company (or similar benefits provided by our company) in effect immediately prior to the date of termination to the extent allowed under the applicable policies. 
These Senior Executive Termination Benefits Agreements contain covenants for the benefit of our company relating to the protection of our confidential information, return of company property, non-solicitation of our employees during employment and for one year thereafter, non-disparagement of our company and its business, continued cooperation in certain matters involving our company and requiring the executive officer to mitigate required payments under the severance agreement by seeking other comparable employment as promptly as practicable after termination and causing any amount earned from any other employment to offset amounts payable under the severance agreement. The employee benefits provided for in these severance agreements terminate when the executive officer obtains other employment. 
The tables below reflect the amount of compensation that each named executive officer would have been entitled to in the event of termination of the executive officer's employment as of December 29, 2018. The amount of compensation payable to each such named executive officer upon termination without cause or resignation for good reason, termination due to retirement, termination due to death or disability, or termination following a change of control is shown below. The amounts shown are estimates of the amounts that would be paid to each executive officer listed upon his termination. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of the applicable executive officer's separation from our company. The amounts are in addition to benefits generally available to U.S. salaried employees, such as accrued vacation. Our company has no program, plan or agreement providing benefits or accelerated vesting to the named executive officers triggered by a voluntary resignation without good reason, a termination for cause or a change of control not connected to a termination of employment.

In addition, in the event of either a termination by the company without cause or a resignation for good reason, Mr. Stuewe would  remain eligible to vest in a prorated portion of the PSUs awarded under our company's 2017 and 2018 executive compensation programs, based on actual performance through the end of the respective performance periods. For purposes of calculating  the payout of PSUs outstanding at December 29, 2018, we have assumed that target performance was achieved, which leads to a value of $2,950,273 based on the closing price of our common stock on December 28, 2018 of $19.04 per share, which  would be the only amount payable to Mr. Stuewe with respect to equity awards following a resignation for good reason outside the context of a change of control.

The award documents underlying these equity grants define Retirement as a grantee's termination of service, other than for cause, after the attainment of (i) at least 55 years of  age with at least ten years of Service or (ii) at least 65 years of age.

Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are providing the following disclosure about the relationship of the annual total compensation of an employee identified as the median compensated individual to the annual total compensation of Mr. Stuewe, our Chief Executive Officer. 
Ratio 
For 2018, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees, other than Mr. Stuewe, was $49,246.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Mr. Stuewes annual total compensation, as reported in the Total column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on  page 45, was $5,846,278.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎     Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Stuewe to the median of the annual total  compensation of all employees is estimated to be 119 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
Identification of Median Employee 
Because there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure, as permitted by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are using the same median employee in the pay ratio calculation as we used in the prior fiscal year. For the prior fiscal year, we selected December 31, 2017 as the date on which to determine our median employee. For purposes of identifying the median employee, we considered base salary, overtime and bonus payments over the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017. 
Using this methodology, we determined that our median employee was a full-time, hourly employee working in the United States. In determining the annual total compensation of the median employee, we calculated such employee's compensation in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K as required pursuant to SEC executive compensation disclosure rules. This calculation is the same calculation used to determine total compensation for purposes of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table with respect to each of the named executive officers. The ratio represents a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.

Our non-employee directors receive an annual compensation package composed of an annual retainer paid in quarterly installments, per-meeting fees and an annual grant of restricted stock units. In addition, our lead director and the chairman of each of the audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees receive an additional annual retainer for such additional service paid in quarterly installments. In accordance with its written charter, the compensation committee is responsible for examining from time to time the overall compensation program for our non-employee directors, including an evaluation of the status of our Board's compensation in relation to comparable U.S. companies (in terms of size, business sector, etc.), and reporting its findings to the nominating and corporate governance committee which reviews these findings and reports them to the Board, along with its recommendation of general principles to be used in determining the form and amount of director compensation. There were no changes made to our non-employee director annual compensation package during fiscal 2018. 
During fiscal 2018, non-employee members of the Board were paid an annual retainer equal to $75,000. Each non-employee director also received $1,500 for each Board or committee meeting attended in person or by video where minutes were taken or $1,000 if attended by telephone. The lead director and chairman of each of the audit, compensation, and nominating and corporate governance committees received an additional annual retainer in the following amounts: Lead Director—$95,000; Audit—$19,000; Compensation—$12,750; and Nominating and Corporate Governance—$10,000. As an additional element of annual non-employee director compensation, pursuant to the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, each non-employee director also receives $110,000 of restricted stock units immediately following our annual meeting of stockholders at which such directors are elected. Accordingly, following our annual meeting of stockholders on May 8, 2018, each non-employee director, except for Ms. Ringenberg, received a grant of $110,000 in value of restricted stock units, with the number of units granted being determined using the closing price of our common stock on May 8, 2018. In the case of Ms. Ringenberg, she received a prorated grant of $55,753 in value of restricted stock units, with the number of units granted being determined using the closing price of our common stock on November 5, 2018, the date of her appointment to the Board. In the aggregate, 61,806 restricted stock units were granted to non-employee directors during the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. 
Mr. Stuewe received no additional compensation for serving on the Board.

Our Code of Conduct addresses our company's procedures with respect to the review and approval of "related party transactions" that are required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations. The Code of Conduct provides that any transaction or activity, in which Darling is involved, with a "related party" (which is defined as an employee's child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law,daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law, or any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of an employee of ours, or any entity that is either wholly or substantially owned or controlled by an employee of ours or any of the foregoing persons and any trust of which an employee of ours is a trustee or beneficiary) shall be subject to review by our general counsel so that appropriate measures can be put into place to avoid either an actual conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. Any waivers of this conflict of interest policy must be in writing and be pre-approved by our general counsel. 
Since January 1, 2018, no transaction has been identified as a reportable related person transaction.

To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of the reports furnished to us, the aforesaid Section 16(a) filing requirements were met on a timely basis during fiscal 2018, except that, due to an inadvertent administrative error, a required Form 4 was not filed on a timely basis to report an exercise of options by Mr. Macaluso; however, the Form 4 was promptly filed after becoming aware of the error.

            REPORT OF THE AUDIT  COMMITTEE 
            REPORT OF THE AUDIT  COMMITTEE 
[END TABLE]
The following report of the audit committee shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or incorporated by reference in any document so filed. 
Under the guidance of a written charter adopted by the Board, the audit committee oversees our management's conduct of the financial reporting process on behalf of our Board. A copy of our audit committee charter can be found on our website at http://ir.darlingii.com/corporate-governance. The audit committee also appoints the accounting firm to be retained to audit our company's consolidated financial statements, and once retained, the accounting firm reports directly to the audit committee. The audit committee is responsible for approving both audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors. 
Management is responsible for our company's financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our company's independent auditors are responsible for auditing those consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those consolidated financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The audit committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes. It is not the audit committee's duty or responsibility to conduct auditing or accounting reviews. 
The audit committee met with management periodically during fiscal 2018 to consider the adequacy of our company's internal controls, and discussed these matters and the overall scope and plans for the audit of our company with our independent auditors, KPMG LLP. The audit committee met with the independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examination, their evaluation of our internal controls and the overall quality of our financial reporting. 
The audit committee also discussed with senior management and KPMG LLP our company's disclosure controls and procedures and the certifications by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are required by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for certain of our company's filings with the SEC. 
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the audit committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. 
The audit committee reviewed with the independent auditors, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our company's accounting principles and other matters as are required to be discussed with the audit committee under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. In addition, the audit committee has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors' independence from our company and our management, including the matters in the written disclosures and letter which were received by the audit committee from the independent auditors as required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the auditor's independence. The audit committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

   PROPOSAL 2 – RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT           
[END TABLE]
The audit committee has selected KPMG LLP to serve as our company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2019. KPMG LLP has served as our company's independent registered public accountants since 1989. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the audit committee periodically considers whether the annual audit of the company's financial statements should be conducted by another firm. The lead audit partner on the company's engagement serves no more than five consecutive years in that role, in accordance with SEC rules. Our audit committee chair and management have direct input into the selection of the lead audit partner. 
The members of the audit committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of KPMG LLP to serve as our company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Consequently, we are asking our stockholders to ratify our company's selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accountants at the Annual Meeting. Although ratification is not required by our Amended and Restated Bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the selection is not ratified, the audit committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. 
One or more representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
In addition to performing the audit of our consolidated financial statements, KPMG LLP provided various other services during fiscal 2018 and 2017. The aggregate fees billed for fiscal 2018 and 2017 for each of the following categories of services are set forth below: 
Audit Fees. The aggregate fees billed or to be billed for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP during the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 for the audit of our financial statements as well as for the audit of our internal controls over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the review of our interim financial statements for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were $4,571,000 and $4,920,000, respectively. 
Audit-Related Fees. The aggregate fees billed or to be billed for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP during the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were $56,000 and $42,000, respectively, for services related to specific audit compliance procedures. 
Tax Fees. The aggregate fees billed or to be billed for tax compliance, advice and planning services rendered by KPMG LLP for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were $114,600 and $0, respectively. 
All Other Fees. The aggregate fees billed or to be billed for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP during the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 for services other than those described above as "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees" and "Tax Fees" were $0 and $140,000, respectively, related to evaluation and assessment services for the implementation of new accounting standards. 
Pre-approval Policy 
The audit committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of these services does not impair the auditor's independence. 
All audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services provided by KPMG LLP were pre-approved by the audit committee, which concluded that the provision of these services by KPMG LLP was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. The audit committee charter provides for pre-approval of any audit or non-audit services provided to us by our independent auditors. The audit committee may delegate to its chairman pre-approval authority with respect to all permitted audit and non-audit services, provided that any services pre-approved pursuant to this delegated authority will be presented to the full audit committee at a subsequent committee meeting. 
Required Vote 
Ratification of KPMG LLP as our company's independent registered public accountant for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the company present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (assuming a quorum is present). Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal, and brokers holding shares will be entitled to vote those shares at their discretion.

            PROPOSAL 3 – ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and related tables and disclosure, commonly known as a "say on pay" proposal. At our 2017 annual meeting, our stockholders supported an annual frequency for this advisory vote. As such, the Board has determined that our company will hold this advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers each year. 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation program is designed to reward the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals and to align executives' interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding performance above established goals with the ultimate objective of improving stockholder value. Stockholders are encouraged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, beginning on page 23, for a more detailed discussion of our executive compensation program, including information about fiscal year 2018 compensation of our NEOs. 
As more fully described under "Say On Pay Advisory Vote Results and Stockholder Engagement Process" on page 27 of this Proxy Statement, we have conducted a stockholder engagement process for the past several years and routinely interact with stockholders throughout the year about executive compensation and other matters. The feedback received from our stockholders was tremendously valuable and was incorporated into the full compensation committee's discussion and design of our current compensation program, as more fully described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis beginning on page 23 of this Proxy Statement. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, our stockholders showed strong support of the program, as approximately 97.1% of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory vote to approve executive compensation. 
We are asking our stockholders to once again indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this Proxy Statement. This say on pay proposal gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" adoption of the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Darling Ingredients Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with Item 402 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and related tables and disclosure." 
Required Vote 
Approval of the above resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the company present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter (assuming a quorum is present). Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote on this proposal, and therefore such broker "non-votes" will have no effect on the outcome. 
The say on pay vote is advisory and therefore not binding on our company, the compensation committee or the Board. However, the compensation committee and the Board value the opinions of our stockholders and will carefully consider the outcome of the vote and take into consideration any concerns raised by stockholders when determining future compensation arrangements.

[END TABLE]
Why am I receiving these materials? 
Our records indicate that you owned your shares of Darling common stock at the close of business on the Record Date (March 13, 2019). You have been sent this Proxy Statement and the enclosed proxy card because the Board of Directors of Darling is soliciting your proxy to vote your shares of common stock at the Annual Meeting on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. 
What am I voting on? 
There are three matters scheduled for a vote: 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
All owners of our common stock as of the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to vote their shares of common stock at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. As of the Record Date, a total of 164,696,428 shares of common stock were outstanding and eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the Annual Meeting. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, enclosed proxy card (if you received your proxy materials by mail) or voting instruction card shows the number of shares you are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD: SHARES REGISTERED IN YOUR NAME 
If on the Record Date your shares were registered directly in your name with Darling, then you are a stockholder of record. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or vote by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, to ensure your vote is counted, Darling encourages you to vote either by Internet, by telephone or by filling out and returning the enclosed proxy card (if you received your proxy materials by mail). 
BENEFICIAL OWNER: SHARES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A BROKER OR BANK 
If on the Record Date your shares were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other agent on how to vote the shares in your account. 
How do I vote? 
Your shares may only be voted at the Annual Meeting if you are present in person or are represented by proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote by proxy to ensure that your shares will be represented. If you received your proxy materials by mail, to vote by proxy, complete the enclosed proxy card and mail it in the postage-paid envelope provided. You may also vote by using the telephone or the Internet in accordance with the instructions provided on the enclosed proxy card (if you received your proxy materials by mail) or on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. 
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by timely submission of a written revocation to our Secretary at our principal executive offices located at 251 O'Connor Ridge Boulevard, Suite 300, Irving, Texas 75038, submission of a properly executed later-dated proxy or by timely voting by ballot at the Annual Meeting. Voting by proxy will in no way limit your right to vote at the Annual Meeting if you later decide to attend in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not by itself constitute a revocation of your proxy – you must vote at the Annual Meeting. 
If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or other similar organization that holds your shares in "street name," you will receive instructions from that organization that you must follow in order for your shares to be voted. 
All shares that you are entitled to vote and that are represented by a properly-completed proxy received prior to the Annual Meeting and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions on the proxy. If you properly deliver your proxy but fail to indicate how your shares should be voted, the shares represented by your proxy will be voted FOR Proposal 1, FOR Proposal 2 and FOR Proposal 3 and in the discretion of the persons named in the proxy as proxy appointees as to any other matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. 
Who may attend the Annual Meeting? 
All stockholders that were stockholders of Darling as of the Record Date, or their authorized representatives, may attend the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or other similar organization that holds your shares in "street name" and you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, you should bring proof of ownership to the Annual Meeting, such as a current bank or brokerage account statement, to ensure your admission.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT VOTING AND THE ANNUAL MEETING 
How will votes be counted? 
How will votes be counted? 
The Annual Meeting will be held if a quorum, consisting of a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote, is represented in person or by proxy. Brokers will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum, although brokers will not have discretionary authority to vote on certain matters. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a nominee, such as a bank or broker, holding shares for a beneficial owner, does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Under the rules of the NYSE, absent instructions from the beneficial owners, banks and brokers who hold shares in street name for beneficial owners have the authority to vote only on "routine" corporate matters. The ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm is considered to be a routine matter, while the election of directors and the advisory vote to approve executive compensation are not. 
PROPOSAL 1. With respect to the nominees for director listed under "Proposal 1 – Election of Directors," to be elected, each nominee must receive a majority of all votes cast (assuming a quorum is present) with respect to that nominee's election. A majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast for a nominee's election must exceed the number of votes cast against such nominee's election. Each nominee receiving more votes for his election than votes against his election will be elected. In the election of directors, you may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" with respect to each nominee. If you elect to abstain in the election of directors, the abstention will not impact the election of directors. In tabulating the voting results for the election of directors, only "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes are counted. Broker "non-votes" will not be counted as a vote cast with respect to a nominee and will therefore not affect the outcome of the vote on Proposal 1. 
PROPOSAL 2. With respect to Proposal 2 – "Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accountant," the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote is required for approval of this item. You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." If you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against this item. Your broker (or another organization that holds your shares for you) may exercise its discretionary authority to vote your shares in favor of or against Proposal 2. 
PROPOSAL 3. With respect to Proposal 3 – "Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation," the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote is required for approval of this item. You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." If you abstain from voting, it will have the same effect as a vote against this item. Your broker (or another organization that holds your shares for you) does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares with regard to Proposal 3. Therefore, if your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, dealer or similar organization that provides a proxy to us, and the organization has not received your instructions as to how to vote your shares on this proposal, a broker "non-vote" will occur and your shares will have no impact on the outcome. 
Although the advisory vote on Proposal 3 is non-binding, as provided by law, our Board will review the results of the vote and will take it into account in making future decisions regarding executive compensation.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT VOTING AND THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Who will count the votes? 
Who will count the votes? 
Our transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, will tally the vote and will serve as inspector of election at the Annual Meeting. 
Why did I receive in the mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials rather than a full set of proxy materials? 
SEC rules allow companies to provide stockholders with access to proxy materials over the Internet rather than mailing the materials to stockholders. To conserve natural resources and reduce costs, we are sending to many of our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice"). The Notice provides instructions for accessing the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or for requesting printed copies of the proxy materials. The Notice also provides instructions for requesting the delivery of the proxy materials for future annual meetings in printed form by mail or electronically by email. 
How are proxies being solicited and who will pay for the solicitation of proxies? 
We will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, solicitation may be made by our directors, officers and employees by other means, including telephone, over the Internet or in person. No special compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or employees for the solicitation of proxies. To solicit proxies, we will also request the assistance of banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees or fiduciaries, and, upon request, will reimburse these organizations or individuals for their reasonable expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners and in obtaining authorization for the execution of proxies. We will also use the services of the proxy solicitation firm of Georgeson Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies. For these services, we will pay a fee that is not expected to exceed $10,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses. 
Who can help answer my other questions and to whom should I send a request for copies of certain material? 
If you have more questions about voting, wish to obtain another proxy card or wish to receive a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 without charge, you should contact:

            HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIAL 
            HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIAL 
[END TABLE]
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., banks, brokers, trustees or other nominees) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Each stockholder who participates in householding will continue to receive a separate proxy card (if the proxy materials are received by mail). 
A number of brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. A single proxy statement report will be delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, please notify your bank, broker, trustee or other nominee and direct a written request to Darling Ingredients Inc., Attn: Investor Relations, 251 O'Connor Ridge Boulevard, Suite 300, Irving, Texas 75038 or make an oral request by telephone at (972) 717-0300. If any stockholders in your household wish to receive a separate copy of this Proxy Statement, they may call or write to Investor Relations and we will promptly provide additional copies. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement at their address and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their bank, broker, trustee or other nominee.

Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the Proxy Statement not as an alternative to net income, but rather as a measure of the Company's operating performance and is not intended to be a presentation in accordance with GAAP. Since EBITDA (generally, net income plus interest expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is not calculated identically by all companies, this presentation may not be comparable to EBITDA or adjusted EBITDA presentations disclosed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated in this presentation and represents, for any relevant period, net income/(loss) plus depreciation and amortization, goodwill and long-lived asset impairment, interest expense, (income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, income tax provision, other income/(expense) and equity in net (income)/loss of unconsolidated subsidiary. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating the Company's operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry because the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA generally eliminates the effects of financing income taxes and certain non-cash and other items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. 
As a result, the Company's management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure to evaluate performance and for other discretionary purposes. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, and is not intended to be a presentation in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the Company evaluates the impact of foreign exchange on operating cash flow, which is defined as segment operating income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization.
