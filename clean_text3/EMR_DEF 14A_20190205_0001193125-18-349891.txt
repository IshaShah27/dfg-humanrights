Dear Fellow Shareholder: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 I am pleased to invite you to join us at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Emerson Electric Co. to be held on Tuesday, February 5, 2019  at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, at the Emerson headquarters located at 8000 W. Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63136.   At this year's meeting, we will vote on the election of three directors and the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as Emerson's independent registered  public accounting firm. We will also hold a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of Emerson's named executive officers. We will also report on our business and provide an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions.   Three years ago, we introduced a bold, new vision for the future of Emerson: two complementary  platforms to focus our expertise around our core strengths – Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions. We are seeing this vision come to life and celebrating the strategic wins our repositioning has made possible.  Over the past year, Emerson experienced strong growth in sales, earnings and cash flow that reinforced our market leadership position. Our growth was led by U.S. markets, and we continue to experience strong performance in Asia, particularly in  China. We are also seeing growth in Europe, where we've made acquisitions that will give us a stronger presence in key markets like Germany.

In 2018, we continued to invest for growth, enhance critical capabilities for our customers and increase shareholder value. We deployed $2.2 billion for bolt-on mergers and acquisitions to drive sales and EPS growth, and we repurchased $1 billion in shares. At the same time, we increased our M&A and share repurchase targets through 2021 and enabled the business to continue to deliver on dividend growth, as we have done for 62 years. This strategic, balanced approach to capital deployment is shaping a bright future and positioning the next generation of leadership for continued success. For more information on our 2018 results, please see our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders that is being made available with this Proxy Statement. 
Your vote is very important. I encourage you to complete, sign and return your proxy card, or use telephone or internet voting prior to the meeting, so that your shares will be represented and voted at the meeting even if you cannot attend. On behalf of the Board of Directors and all of us at Emerson, we thank our shareholders for your continued trust and support. 
December 14, 2018 
Sincerely, 
DAVID N. FARR 
Chairman and 
Chief Executive Officer

Executive Compensation Highlights 
Our pay for performance philosophy and key principles of our executive compensation program directed our performance objectives that drove strong fiscal 2018 results. We continued to focus on objectives that maximize shareholder value, make Emerson a good global citizen, enhance critical capabilities and encourage career-long commitments to the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• NEO Compensation. Fiscal 2018 NEO total compensation, including increased annual cash bonuses, reflects our strong  fiscal 2018 results and individual performance and accomplishments of our NEOs, including continued success in reshaping the Company into two global franchises; the Company's significant growth and strategic merger and acquisition activity; the  actions taken to maintain strong profitability during a changing business environment and leveraging the opportunities for savings and maximized returns resulting from the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alignment with Shareholders. We continued our practice of providing long-term stock-based incentives as a  significant portion of total compensation. Our NEOs generally hold the stock they earn, substantially exceeding our stock ownership guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Performance. Performance shares awards were again the primary long-term incentives for fiscal 2018. These  awards are subject to the Company's achievement of established financial objectives over the Fiscal 2018 – 2020 performance period.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive Compensation. We continued to target NEO total compensation in the median market range.

From Lead Independent Director 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         CLEMENS A.H. BOERSIG 
         CLEMENS A.H. BOERSIG 
[END TABLE]
When I took on the role of lead independent director for Emerson in April 2018, it was with excitement and a sense of opportunity. I've known Emerson for 30 years and have a great deal of respect for both the Company and David Farr as chairman and CEO. The Company's principled management style and rigorous focus on governance are a testament to its sustained success – and to shareholders' continued faith in this 128-year-old Company. 
The role of lead independent director is an output of a disciplined Board focus. Independence among Board members is a critical tenet of strong governance that ensures the voice and interests of shareholders drive important decisions around strategy, capital allocation, compensation and succession planning. The lead independent director role acts as the Board's liaison with the chairman, consulting regularly on company issues and meeting with shareholders, as needed. 
As a Company with a strong culture of performance, having David serve as both chairman and CEO of Emerson drives long-term value creation for shareholders. At the same time, it ensures management and the Board are aligned in our view of opportunities and risks, while driving consistent focus on strategy and execution that support Emerson's role as a technology leader and industry steward. 
Through my role, I partner closely with David – serving as a check and balance and building critical controls into the governance process. The CEO as chair is best equipped to drive focus on the most impactful areas of the Company and promote responsible decision-making by the Board, due to his day-to-day knowledge of the business. My role – and the role of the Board – is to provide guidance on how daily decisions align with the Company's strategy and direction. 
Emerson's Board culture is one of high engagement. We are both well-informed about the Company and interested in the industry, seeking to understand the latest trends. We employ a thorough annual planning cycle to set strategic priorities and evaluate risks. This process includes a multi-day strategy workshop and rigorous process, overseen by the audit committee, to identify and prioritize the most important financial and operational threats facing the Company. 
Board diversity and experience are critical to our effectiveness. Our Board – with women making up one-third of our directors – has a wealth of experience that brings a balanced approach to strategy evaluation and important investment decisions. As a highly engaged Board, we provide insights that inform the Company's strategy and its corporate social responsibility. In fact, this year we accelerated annual Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) reporting by six months – providing shareholders and partners with additional line of sight into the Company's latest focus areas. I invite you to read more in our full CSR Report on Emerson.com. 
On behalf of the Board, thank you for your continued engagement and support. 
Sincerely, 
Clemens A.H. Boersig 
Lead Independent Director, Emerson 
Board and Committee Operations 
Board and Corporate Governance 
Board Responsibility 
The primary responsibility of our Board is to foster our long-term success. In fulfilling this role, each Director must exercise good faith business judgment in the best interests of Emerson and our shareholders. Our Board has responsibility for establishing broad corporate policies, setting strategic direction and overseeing management. Management has responsibility for our day-to-day operations, implementing these policies and strategic direction, subject to Board oversight. 
Governance Principles and Ethics Program 
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles and Practices that govern the structure and operations of our Board, Board oversight of management and relations between the Board and our shareholders. In addition, our Board has adopted an ethics program that applies to all Emerson employees and our Directors, and includes an employee code of conduct, supplements that are specifically applicable to our Directors and executive officers, and an additional code of ethics applicable to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller.
The Company's Corporate Governance Principles and each component of its ethics program are available on the Company's website at www.Emerson.com, Investors, Corporate Governance, Business Ethics. Printed copies of these documents are available to shareholders upon written request to Emerson Electric Co., 8000 West Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63136, Attn: Secretary. The Company intends to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K by posting required information at the same location on its website. 
The Board of Directors annually reviews its governance policies and practices, taking into account changes in applicable law, trends in corporate governance and input from shareholders. 
Recent Corporate Governance Changes 
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly considers a broad range of corporate governance issues and is committed to adopting governance practices that are the most beneficial to the Company and its shareholders. As part of its review process, the Board recently made changes to Emerson's corporate governance polices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy Access Bylaw. Recently, we amended our Bylaws to adopt proxy access, which provides eligible  shareholders a process for including their director nominees in the Company's proxy materials. Proxy access is discussed below at "Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee—Proxy Access" on pages 13-14.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Lead Independent Director. Recently, we amended our Corporate Governance Principles to provide for a Lead  Independent Director, as discussed below in "Board Leadership Structure" on page 9.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Removal of Forum Selection Bylaw. Last year, we submitted a proposal to shareholders to ratify our forum selection  Bylaw, which provided that the sole and exclusive forum for specified legal actions would be courts located in Missouri. The proposal was not approved. As a result, the Board has subsequently reconsidered the provision and removed it from the  Bylaws.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Proposals to Allow Shareholders' Right to Amend Bylaws and to Declassify Board. We recognize that the  right of shareholders to amend bylaws and a declassified Board of Directors are increasingly considered important aspects of good corporate governance. In response to these trends and shareholder requests, we have acted. Last year, we approved and  submitted for shareholder approval amendments to our Restated Articles of Incorporation providing shareholders the right to amend our Bylaws. However, under our Restated Articles of Incorporation, the amendment required the vote of 85% of  outstanding shares in favor for approval, which was not attained. Similarly, our Board recently proposed an amendment to our Restated Articles to declassify our Board. That amendment also required such 85% vote and did not attain the required  approval level.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting. In 2015, at the Board's direction, we published our first Corporate  Social Responsibility Report highlighting the Company's environmental stewardship, integrity and ethics, corporate governance, political spending and lobbying, human resources and diversity, supply chain practices and community involvement. In  2017, the Company published its third Corporate Social Responsibility Report and accelerated its publication by approximately six months.  
[END TABLE]
We believe these actions are marks of good governance and enhance our accountability to shareholders. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE OPERATIONS 
Board Meetings and Attendance
There were ten meetings of the Board during fiscal 2018. All Directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and committees on which they served. Directors are strongly encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting, although the Company has no policy requiring attendance. All of the Directors then in office attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board believes that it should have the flexibility to determine whether the same person should serve as both Chair and CEO based on what it believes will provide appropriate Company leadership. The Board believes that its current structure, with Mr. Farr serving as both Chair and CEO is appropriate given Mr. Farr's past success and extensive experience in these roles, the efficiencies of having the CEO serve as Chair, the Company's strong corporate governance structure, including Mr. Boersig's strong leadership role as Lead Independent Director, and the Company's financial performance under Mr. Farr's leadership. 
As part of its leadership structure review, in October 2016 the Board established the Lead Independent Director position to strengthen the independent leadership of the Board. The Lead Independent Director is elected from the independent Directors for a three-year term. Among other things, the Lead Independent Director chairs regularly scheduled meetings of non-management Directors, reviews Board agendas and information, calls meetings of the independent Directors, acts as the Board's key liaison with the Chairman and serves on the Board's executive committee. The Lead Independent Director is available for consultation with shareholders. The Chair and CEO consults periodically with the Lead Independent Director and the committee Chairs, all of whom are independent, on Board matters and on issues facing the Company. 
Each year the Board, through its Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, reviews its leadership structure including the combined Chair and CEO, to ensure that it remains appropriate for the Company. 
Board Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board has responsibility for oversight of the Company's risk management process. This process is designed to provide to the Board timely visibility into the identification, assessment and management of critical risks. The Audit Committee assists the Board by annually reviewing and discussing with management this process and its functionality. The areas of critical risk include strategic, operational, compliance, environmental, financial and reputational. The full Board, or the appropriate committee, receives this information through updates from management to enable it to understand and monitor the Company's risk management process. 
Board Composition 
Our Board consists of nine Directors divided into three classes, with the terms of office of each class ending in successive years. The Directors in one class are elected at each Annual Meeting to serve for a three-year term and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Periodically, a Director is elected to a shorter term, or moved into a different class between meetings, to rebalance the classes as a result of the early departure of a Director. 
Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, a Director may not stand for election after age 72. If our Board determines that continued service beyond this period is in the best interests of Emerson and our shareholders, our Board may amend the Bylaws to waive this requirement and allow election to additional one-year terms. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE OPERATIONS 
We are committed to reviewing our Board's composition to ensure that we continue to have the right mix of skills, diversity, background and tenure. The diversity and tenure composition of our Board is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Diversity          Tenure

[END TABLE]
Our Board's membership represents a balanced approach to Director tenure, allowing our Board to benefit from the experience of longer-serving Directors as well as the fresh perspectives of newer Directors. The Board is continuously seeking out highly-qualified, diverse candidates to add to the range of skills and experiences represented on our Board. 
Our Directors have a wide range of skills and experience in a variety of professions and industries, including:

[END TABLE]
The specific background, skills and experience of each of our Directors is detailed under Proposal 1 – Election of Directors. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the primary responsibility for developing a Director succession plan. The Committee periodically reviews our Board composition and, as discussed above, identifies the appropriate mix of experiences, skills, attributes and tenure for our Board in light of our Company's current and future business environment and strategic direction, all with the objective of recommending a group of Directors that can best continue our success and represent our shareholders' interests. The Committee and our Board are committed to developing a diverse pool of potential candidates for future Board service. As part of this process, the Board recently added to the Board Lori Lee, CEO AT&T Latin America and Global Marketing Officer for AT&T, Inc. Among other attributes, Ms. Lee brings business insight and breadth of experience in international relations from her extensive experience in strategy, operations and marketing across several countries. 
Other Key Governance Policies 
We have adopted corporate governance policies which encourage significant long-term stock ownership and align the interests of our executives with our shareholders. These policies include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive compensation practices that incentivize long-term performance with equity compensation using multi-year  performance and vesting periods; align executive and shareholder interests and reward for superior performance rather than creating a sense of entitlement. See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on  page 19.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership guidelines that require NEOs to hold stock equal to at least a specified multiple of their base  salaries.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Blackout and stock trading policies that require permission to trade in Emerson stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clawback policies that allow us to reduce, cancel or recover incentive compensation tied to intentional misconduct  that led to a material restatement of our financial statements. See "Policies Supporting Our Fundamental Principles" on page 30.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pledging and anti-hedging policies that prohibit certain speculative transactions that are not in alignment with  our shareholders. See "Policies Supporting Our Fundamental Principles" on page 30.  
[END TABLE]
BOARD AND COMMITTEE OPERATIONS 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
We have developed and implemented processes to obtain and review all transactions and relationships in which the Company and any of our Directors, Director nominees or executive officers, or any of their immediate family members, are participants, and to determine whether any of these individuals have a direct or indirect material interest in any such transaction. Transactions that are determined to be material to a related person are disclosed as required. Pursuant to these processes, all Directors and executive officers annually complete a Director and Executive Officer Questionnaire and a Conflict of Interest Questionnaire that are designed to identify related person transactions and both actual and potential conflicts of interest. We also review the nature and extent of business between the Company and other companies affiliated with our Directors or executive officers. Under the Company's ethics program, an executive officer is required to immediately disclose all the relevant facts and circumstances of any actual or potential conflict of interest to the Company's Ethics Committee. If the Ethics Committee determines that there is a conflict, it will refer the matter to the Board of Directors. A Director is required to immediately disclose all the relevant facts and circumstances of any actual or potential conflict of interest to the Board. In each case, the Board will review the matter to make a final determination as to whether a conflict exists, and, if so, the appropriate resolution. 
The Company has a written ethics program applicable to all Directors and executive officers of the Company that prohibits Directors and executive officers from entering into transactions, or having any relationships, that would result in a conflict of interest with the Company. Waivers of the ethics program requirements for Directors and executive officers may only be granted by the Board of Directors. The Company's ethics program documents can be found on the Company's website at www.Emerson.com, Investors, Corporate Governance, Business Ethics. 
Certain Business Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
Based on the review described above, there were no transactions from October 1, 2017 through the date of this proxy statement, and there are no currently proposed transactions, in which the Company was or is to be a participant, in which the amount involved exceeded $120,000 and in which any of the Company's Directors or executive officers or any of their immediate family members, or any beneficial holder of more than 5% of our common stock, either had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
Director Independence 
The Board has determined that all current Directors, other than Mr. Farr, are independent, as defined under the general independence standards of the NYSE. R. L. Stephenson and J. W. Prueher resigned from the Board during fiscal 2018, but were determined to be independent while they served. All Directors identified as independent meet the Board adopted independence standards. These standards are included in Appendix A and are available on the Company's website at www.Emerson.com, Investors, Corporate Governance, Principles & Practices. 
In the course of the Board's independence determinations, it considered any transactions, relationships and arrangements as required by the Company's independence standards. In particular, with respect to each of the three most recently completed fiscal years, the Board considered for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Flach, Levatich, Stephenson and Lee, the annual amount of sales to Emerson by the company which the Director serves  or served as an executive officer, and purchases by that company from Emerson, and determined that in each case the amounts of such sales and purchases in fiscal 2018 were less than 0.027% of such other company's annual revenue and in each year  were immaterial and well below the threshold set in the Emerson independence standards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stephenson, an immediate family member employed by KPMG, and determined that such person was not a partner of such firm  and did not participate in the audit of Emerson or provide any other services to Emerson.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Golden, the annual amount paid by Emerson to the law firm of which he is a partner, and determined that the amount of such  payments in fiscal 2018 was less than 1.10% of such firm's annual revenues and was in each year immaterial and well below the threshold set in the Emerson independence standards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Levatich, Prueher, and Turley, the annual amount of contributions by Emerson to charitable organizations for which the  Director serves as a director, officer or trustee and determined that such contributions were immaterial, below the threshold set in the Emerson independence standards, were made through the Company's normal corporate charitable donation  approval process and were not made on behalf of any Director. For 2018, the amount of such contributions were: Boersig: $10,000 to the New York Philharmonic; Levatich: $4,000 to Northwestern University; Prueher: $1,600 to the University of Virginia;  and Turley: $139,500 to the Boy Scouts of America-Greater St. Louis Area Council, $992,000 to the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre and $655,000 to Forest Park Forever. These last three organizations are prominent St. Louis civic organizations to  which Emerson, as a St. Louis headquartered company, has provided substantial support for over 30 years, long before Mr. Turley joined the Emerson Board or the boards of these organizations.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE OPERATIONS 
Committees of Our Board of Directors 
Our Board of Directors has delegated certain of its responsibilities to committees to provide for more efficient Board operations and allow Directors to engage in deeper analysis and oversight in specific areas of importance. The members and Committee Chairs are designated by the Board based on recommendations from the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The Chair of each Committee helps develop the agenda for that Committee, and provides a report to our Board on Committee activities. Each Committee annually reviews the adequacy of its Charter and conducts an evaluation of its performance. 
Our Board has adopted written Committee charters which are available on our website, www.emerson.com, Investors, Corporate Governance, Committee Charters. The primary responsibilities and membership of each Committee are below:

Board and Committee Self-Evaluations 
Our Board assesses annually its effectiveness and that of its Committees. All Directors complete a self-evaluation form for the Board and for each Committee on which they serve. These forms include numerical ratings for certain key metrics, as well as the opportunity for written comments. The comments provide key insights into the areas Directors believe the Board can improve or in which its performance is strong. The self-evaluation results are reported to the full Board, and each Committee is provided with its Committee evaluation results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee oversees the process. Self-evaluation topics include number and length of meetings, topics covered and materials provided, Committee structure and activities, Board composition and expertise, succession planning, Director participation and interaction with management and promotion of ethical behavior. Our Board discusses the results of each annual self-evaluation and, as appropriate, implements enhancements and other modifications identified during the self-evaluation. 
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
Nomination Process 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly reviews the appropriate size and composition of the Board and anticipates vacancies and required expertise. The Committee reviews potential nominees from several sources, including Directors, management, shareholders or others. The Company may retain an independent search firm to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. Ms. Lee, who is standing for election for the first time, was recommended by Messrs. Farr and Stephenson. 
In evaluating potential nominees, the Committee considers the knowledge, experience, integrity and judgment of the candidates, their contribution to the diversity of backgrounds, experience and skills on the Board and their ability to devote sufficient time and effort to their duties as Directors. The Board considers the following experience particularly relevant: manufacturing, global business, in particular in emerging markets and China, business development, technology and innovation, legal, investment banking, acquisitions and finance, government, corporate governance and information technology, as well as experience on the boards of other major organizations. The Company's Corporate Governance Principles set forth the minimum qualifications for nominees. The best candidates are then recommended by the Committee to the Board. 
The Board's policy is to seek the most qualified candidates without regard to race, gender, national origin, religion, disability, age or sexual orientation. However, in evaluating candidates the Committee will consider these diversity criteria. The Board seeks to maintain a balance of perspectives, qualities and skills on the Board to obtain a diversity of viewpoints to better understand the technical, economic, political and social environments in which the Company operates. Existing Board members and outside agencies recommend candidates to further these policy objectives. The Board's success on these objectives is measured by the range of viewpoints represented on the Board. 
The Committee will consider candidates recommended by shareholders if required biographical information is properly submitted as described in "Other Matters—Future Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" at page 58 below. Properly submitted shareholder recommendations are sent to the Committee and will receive the same consideration as others identified to the Committee. 
The Company's Bylaws permit shareholders to nominate Directors at an annual meeting of shareholders or at a special meeting at which Directors are to be elected. The procedures for making such nominations are discussed in "Other Matters—Future Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" beginning on page 58. 
Proxy Access 
In 2017, the Board amended the Company's Bylaws to permit up to 20 shareholders owning in the aggregate at least 3% of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the nominating holders and the 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE OPERATIONS 
nominees satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws, including providing the Company with advance notice of the nomination. For more information on how to submit a nominee for inclusion in Company proxy materials pursuant to these provisions, see "Other Matters—Future Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" on page 58 below. 
Director Compensation 
Processes and Procedures for Determination of Director Compensation 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee annually reviews compensation practices for the Company's Directors and makes recommendations to the Board regarding the form and amount of compensation for determination by the Board. To assist the Committee in performing these duties, management engages an outside consultant to prepare a director compensation analysis and to make recommendations. Based on this analysis, management makes recommendations regarding Director compensation for the Committee's consideration. Frederic W. Cook & Co. prepared this analysis for fiscal 2018. Changes were recommended by management and the Committee and made by the Board. 
Director Compensation Program 
Each non-management Director is paid an annual retainer in cash and/or restricted stock or restricted stock units ("RSUs"), as well as meeting fees and reimbursement of expenses. The Lead Independent Director and each Committee Chair receive an additional cash retainer. Mr. Farr does not receive any additional compensation for service on the Board. In fiscal 2018, the Director compensation program provided for the following payments:

[END TABLE]
Emerson's Director Stock Ownership Policy generally requires non-management Directors to hold stock equal to five times annual cash compensation, subject to a phase-in policy for new Directors. Our non-management Directors are required to hold all restricted stock and RSUs until retirement from our Board. The awards generally do not vest until the last day of a Director's term after the age of 72, or earlier death, disability or a change of control of the Company. If a Director's tenure on the Board ends for any other reason, the vesting of the award is at the discretion of the Committee. If the restrictions on the awards do not lapse, the awards are forfeited to the Company. Restricted stock includes both dividend and voting rights. Dividend equivalents are paid on RSUs, which do not have voting rights. 
Directors may defer all or a part of their cash compensation under the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Directors may also defer payment of the dividend equivalents on RSUs. Deferred amounts are credited with interest quarterly at the Bank of America prime rate. Under SEC rules, interest on deferred amounts is considered above-market if the rate of interest exceeds 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate. During fiscal 2018, the applicable prime rate ranged from 4.25% to 5.0%, while 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate ranged from 2.96% to 3.57%. A. F. Golden and R. L. Stephenson participated in this deferral program during fiscal 2018 and above-market earnings on their deferred amounts are set forth in the Director Compensation Table. All deferred amounts are payable in cash. 
As part of the Company's charitable contributions practice, the Company may, in the Board's discretion, make a charitable contribution in the names of Emerson and a Director (including management Directors) upon retirement from the Board (as determined by the Board), taking into account the Director's Board tenure, accomplishments, and other relevant factors.

(1)  Mr. Farr is the only management Director, and his compensation is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table and  related tables. He did not receive any additional compensation for his service as a Director. Ms. Lee was elected to the Board effective October 2, 2018 and, as a result, did not receive any compensation during fiscal 2018. Upon her  election, she did receive an award of 600 shares of restricted stock, representing a $46,667 pro rata award of the $140,000 restricted stock portion of the annual retainer previously paid to all non-management Directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  On February 6, 2018, the Directors then in office were awarded 2,038 shares of restricted stock, or RSUs in the case  of Dr. Boersig, with a total value of $139,960 ($140,000 divided by the grant date value of Emerson stock, rounded down to the nearest whole share) representing their fiscal 2018 restricted stock award. Each amount constitutes the aggregate  grant date fair value of restricted stock and RSUs for fiscal 2018 calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.  
[END TABLE]

The Continuing Compensation Plan for Non-Management Directors was terminated on June 4, 2002. Messrs. Golden and Prueher remain eligible for such plan because they were Directors prior  to termination of the plan. These Directors will, after the later of termination of service or age 72, receive $30,000 annually for life, which was the annual cash retainer in effect on that date. If service terminates because of death, the  benefit will be paid to the surviving spouse for five years.

In recognition of his long and distinguished  service on the Board and numerous contributions to the Company's success, the Board of Directors, in its discretion, determined to make charitable contributions in an aggregate amount of $1 million to a number of charities in the names of  Emerson and Mr. Prueher. Of that amount, $200,000 was contributed in fiscal 2018 and is included in the "All Other Compensation" amount for 2018.

Audit Committee 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in providing oversight of the systems and procedures relating to the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's financial reporting process, its systems of internal accounting, financial and reporting controls, the internal audit process, risk management, the independent audit process of the Company's annual financial statements and the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Management is responsible for these processes. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE OPERATIONS 
The Audit Committee reviews with management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor, mitigate and control such exposures. Management has the responsibility for the implementation of these activities. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, including a discussion of the quality and the acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and controls. The Committee also reviews the Company's quarterly earnings press releases and reports on Form 10-Q prior to distribution and filing. 
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Committee reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm's judgments as to the quality and the acceptability of the Company's financial reporting and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Committee under auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"), including the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Interim Auditing Standard AU Section 380, Communication with Audit Committees. In addition, the Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm's independence from management and the Company, including the impact of non-audit related services provided to the Company and the matters in the independent registered public accounting firm's written disclosures required by Rule 3526 of the PCAOB, as may be modified or supplemented. 
The Committee also discussed with the Company's internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm in advance the overall scope and plans for their respective audits, including timing, risk assessments, locations and coverage, and any reliance by the external auditors on work performed by the internal auditors. The Committee meets at least quarterly with the internal auditor and the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's accounting and financial reporting. 
The Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, oversight, qualification, independence, performance, compensation and retention of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, including audit fee negotiations and approval. The Committee has evaluated whether retaining KPMG as the Company's independent auditor for the year is in the best interest of Emerson and its shareholders. The Committee considers whether KPMG's known legal risks include involvement in proceedings that could impair their ability to perform the annual audit, and reviews historical and proposed KPMG fees charged to the Company. 
In performing its review, the Committee also considers the quality, candor and effectiveness of KPMG's communications with the Committee and management; how effectively KPMG maintained its independence as demonstrated by exercising judgment, objectivity and professional skepticism; reports of the PCAOB and other available data regarding the quality of work performed by KPMG; KPMG's long tenure and experience as the Company's auditor, and the geographic reach and expertise of KPMG to address the demands placed on an auditor by the global breadth and complexity of Emerson's business in terms of quantity, quality and location of staff. 
The Committee also considers whether, to assure continuing auditor independence, there should be rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Committee is responsible for the selection of the lead engagement partner, and as required by law, assures rotation of the lead partner every five years. When appropriate, KPMG provides a list of candidates for the role of lead engagement partner, who are then interviewed by members of senior management. The Committee considers their recommendations and those of KPMG leadership, evaluates the candidate's qualifications, strengths and weaknesses and selects the lead engagement partner. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In accordance with its Charter, the Committee has reappointed KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019, based on their overall qualifications, objectivity, significant experience and understanding of the Company's operations, and their ability to deploy resources to match Emerson's global operations.

The Audit Committee approved in advance all services provided by KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures are included within the Audit Committee Charter, which can be found on the Company's website at www.Emerson.com, Investors, Corporate Governance. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter that details the Committee's authority, composition and procedures. The Committee may delegate authority with respect to specific matters to one or more members, provided that all decisions of any such members are presented to the full Committee at its next meeting. For a discussion of delegations of authority to the CEO, see "Equity Compensation Grant Practices" at page 32 below. 
For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed management's process for assessing risk in the Company's compensation programs, policies and practices for its employees, including the Company's executive compensation program and practices. The Committee accepted the result of these reviews that our compensation programs, policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Please see "Our Compensation Best Practices" on page 22 and "Policies Supporting our Fundamental Principles" on page 30 for additional information. 
Role of Executive Officers and the Compensation Consultant
Executive Officers 
As described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Setting Total Compensation" on page 24, our CEO makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee based on management input regarding total compensation of the other executive officers. Management also develops and presents to the Committee design recommendations for compensation programs. 
The Compensation Committee has unrestricted access to management and may request the participation of management or the Committee's independent consultant at any meeting or executive session. Committee meetings are regularly attended by the CEO, except for executive sessions and discussions of his own compensation, by the Vice President-Executive Compensation, who leads some of the discussions regarding the Company's compensation programs, and the Committee's independent consultant. The Committee regularly reports to the Board on compensation matters and annually reviews the CEO's compensation with the Board in executive sessions of non-management Directors only. 
Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has sole discretion, at Company expense, to retain and terminate compensation consultants, independent legal counsel or other advisors, including sole authority to approve their fees and retention terms. Any Committee member may request the participation of independent advisors at any meeting. Management engages Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. from time to time to assist with executive compensation program design and competitive pay analysis. The Committee reviews this information in 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE OPERATIONS 
determining compensation for the NEOs. The Committee has engaged Exequity LLP as its independent consultant. Exequity reports directly to the Committee and performs services as directed by the Committee. In 2018, Exequity reviewed our comparator group companies, the compensation of our CEO and the other NEOs and a pay for performance analysis. Neither Exequity nor Frederic W.

Focus on Values 
As a unified company, we worked with thousands of employees worldwide to articulate our global values that have grounded Emerson for more than 128 years. These values guide how we interact with our employees, shareholders, customers and suppliers. We believe that this is an expectation not only of Emerson, but of our customers and the geographies where we do business. 
Pay for Performance Fundamental Principles 
Our executive compensation program is based on a consistent set of key principles that directs compensation decisions and communicates to participants the Company's core values, critical business strategies and performance objectives. These principles guide the performance objectives that drive strong results to maximize shareholder value, make Emerson a good global citizen, enhance critical capabilities and encourage career-long commitments to the Company. 
These fundamental compensation principles include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maximizing shareholder value by allocating a significant percentage of compensation to performance-based pay that is  dependent on achievement of the Company's performance goals, without encouraging excessive or unnecessary risk taking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• rewarding for superior performance rather than creating a sense of entitlement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• aligning executive and shareholder interests by providing long-term stock-based incentives as a significant portion of  total compensation and expecting executives to hold the stock they earn;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attracting and retaining talented executives by providing competitive compensation and career-growth opportunities; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• rewarding overall corporate results while recognizing individual contributions.

Compensation Mix 
In determining the total compensation of each of our NEOs, the Compensation Committee balances the compensation mix considering the executive's level of responsibilities, career potential, individual performance and service with the Company, with the objective of achieving a high and sustainable level of Company and individual performance.

Emerson vs. Comparator Group 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Elements of Compensation 
Setting Total Compensation 
The Compensation Committee targets total compensation for our NEOs in the median market range of our comparator group. To determine the median range, the Committee uses a competitive pay (cash and long-term stock compensation) analysis for the proxy reported officer positions at the comparator group companies prepared by Frederic W. Cook & Co. The Committee also reviews and confirms the competitive market pay analysis with Exequity, its independent compensation consultant. The competitive pay analysis is not used to establish performance goals in the Company's compensation programs. 
The Committee does not set specific financial targets related to annual cash compensation and pay determinations are not based on any formula. Actual pay is dependent on Company and individual performance and based on the Committee's informed judgment. The Committee does monitor the relative internal compensation relationships between the CEO and the other NEOs, however, no specific pay ratio is targeted. 
The Committee meets in executive session to review and set the CEO's compensation. The Committee considers a number of factors in making its decision, including: market data; compensation elements; Company performance; tenure and experience; retention; and the CEO's individual performance, contributions to the Company and impact on results. The Committee also discusses the CEO's compensation annually with the non-management Directors in executive session. 
For the NEOs and other key executives, our CEO reviews with the Committee the individual performance and leadership potential of these key executives, along with the Company's financial results, and makes individual pay recommendations to the Committee. The CEO's recommendations are informed by our robust annual organizational review, compensation planning and performance rating processes. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Fiscal 2018 CEO and NEO Performance 
CEO Performance. In determining the appropriate level of total compensation for the CEO, the Committee evaluated the Company's strong financial performance in fiscal 2018 (summarized on page 19); his continued success in reshaping the Company into two global franchises; the Company's significant growth and strategic merger and acquisition activity; his critical succession planning leadership; his tenure as CEO; his individual performance and contributions; and the retention of Mr. Farr. Considering these factors, the Committee determined that Mr. Farr's increased 2018 total compensation positioned him appropriately in the median market range, following below median compensation in fiscal 2016 and flat total compensation in fiscal 2017, and reviewed alternatives for continued delivery of the appropriate level of total compensation for Mr. Farr. The Committee noted that Mr. Farr successfully led the Company through the 2018 fiscal year and highlighted the following significant accomplishments.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Fiscal 2018 Compensation Mix 
We believe that our practice of setting a majority of our NEOs pay as "at-risk" pay underscores our commitment to our fundamental pay-for-performance principles. By tying a significant percentage of NEO compensation (cash and equity) to performance-based pay that is dependent on achievement of the Company's performance goals as well as the consistent attainment of strong individual performance, we maximize the value we can deliver to shareholders. In fiscal 2018, 91% of our CEO's pay and an average of 70.5% of the other NEOs' pay was comprised of "at-risk" compensation (amounts do not include other forms of compensation shown in the Summary Compensation Table). 
Annual Cash Compensation 
The Committee targets total annual cash compensation in the median market range of total cash compensation, while placing more emphasis on performance-based annual cash bonus than on base salary. Base salary generally represents 10-20% of total NEO compensation and bonus generally represents 15-25%. 
Base Salary. Fiscal 2018 base salary increases were based on the Committee's review of the Company's performance, individual performance and potential and competitive market compensation. The Committee also considered market survey data that indicated that the predicted merit increase, without promotions, for comparable executive positions averaged approximately 3%.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Bonus. In determining fiscal 2018 bonuses, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's strong financial performance, the continued execution of the Company's strategic repositioning to reshape the Company into two global franchises for Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions, the efforts in the integration of recent acquisitions, actions to navigate a changing global business environment, as well as the individual performance and leadership of each NEO. The Committee used discretion and based its decisions on its informed judgment considering these factors collectively. No individual weightings were assigned to any of these factors. The fiscal 2018 bonus amounts were subject to the IRC Section 162(m) limitation previously established by the Committee (see "Regulatory Considerations" on page 31).

Long-Term Stock Compensation 
As indicated above, the Committee targets total annual compensation for our NEOs in the median market range of our comparator group, placing more emphasis on performance-based equity compensation. We value our long-term stock compensation awards based on the fair value at grant; however, an executive may realize more or less than his or her targeted long-term compensation depending on Company and stock performance over the performance or restriction period. 
Performance shares awards are the primary long-term compensation element and the cornerstone of our pay-for-performance philosophy. We believe that performance shares align the interests of our executives and shareholders and support the achievement of long-term goals of sustained growth in EPS and free cash flow. Restricted stock and stock options are also available for award under our long-term stock-based compensation program. Awards of restricted stock are highly selective and reserved for critical retention, recognition or succession planning purposes. Stock options have not been granted to NEOs since 2015. Annual grants, as opposed to grants every three years, provide the Committee with the flexibility to increase or decrease the amount of an award based on individual performance and target the median market range for total annual compensation. 
Performance Shares. Beginning in fiscal 2016, the Committee moved to annual performance shares awards. Annual grants provide the Committee with more flexibility to increase or decrease the amount of an award based on individual performance and target the median market range for total annual compensation. Each annual performance shares program has a three-year performance period with defined performance targets set by the Committee at the beginning of the period. An award of performance shares under the program represents the right to receive shares of our common stock to the extent the identified performance objectives are met. Dividend equivalents may be paid, but only on earned awards at the end of the performance period. At the end of a performance period, the Committee reviews the Company's financial results against the performance targets and certifies the level of achievement for payout of the awards. Payouts are made primarily in common stock, with a portion paid in cash to cover tax obligations. Awards include confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation obligations and clawback rights and are subject to a double-trigger change of control provision. 
The Committee has authority to determine the targets for each three-year performance shares program from the various measures set forth in the Company's Incentive Shares Plans. The measures specified in the 2015 Incentive Shares Plan are: sales, profit, operating profit, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, pre-tax earnings, earnings, net earnings, any related margins, earnings per share, asset management, cash flow, operating cash flow, free cash flow, days sales outstanding, days payables outstanding, inventory turnover, return on total capital, return on equity, total shareholder return, share price, acquisition and divestiture performance, development and achievement of strategic business objectives, customer satisfaction, new product introductions and performance, cost reductions, manufacturing efficiency, delivery lead time performance, research and development achievements, market share, working capital and geographic expansion. Pursuant to these plans, the Committee may include or exclude from both targets and actual results specified items of an unusual, non-recurring or extraordinary nature.

In making an individual annual award, the Committee considers the NEO's: (1) ability to make a significant contribution to the Company's financial results, (2) level of responsibility, (3) individual performance and (4) leadership potential. The annual performance shares award generally represents more than half of the NEO's total compensation, depending on the NEO's role and responsibilities. 
For the Fiscal 2018 – 2020 Performance Shares Program, the following individual awards were made to the NEOs: D. N. Farr, 173,000 shares; E. L. Monser, 42,000 shares; F. J. Dellaquila, 42,000 shares; M. H. Train, 35,000 shares; S. J. Pelch, 42,000 shares; R. T. Sharp, 35,000 shares. Mr. Monser retired on October 1, 2018. For a discussion of the effect of his retirement on his performance shares and other stock awards, please see "Description of E. L. Monser Letter Agreement" on page 43. 
The performance period for the Fiscal 2016 – 2018 Performance Shares Program ended on September 30, 2018. Targets were based on the 2015 base year with the EPS and Free Cash Flow performance determinations and weightings the same as described above but with the maximum payout at 125% for EPS and 100% for cumulative free cash flow, resulting in a maximum payout of 115%. The Committee determined that the target earnings per share was $3.37 and the target cumulative free cash flow was $6.44 billion. The Company's performance results were appropriately adjusted to reflect the Company's portfolio repositioning activities and the impact of tax reform. The Committee determined that the fiscal 2018 EPS after adjustments of $0.25 was $3.21, and cumulative free cash flow over the performance period was $6.58 billion from $6.54 billion after adjustments of $0.04 billion discussed above. This performance resulted in a 97% payout of the awarded performance shares. The impact from the adjustments resulted in a reduced payment under the formula. The payouts are reflected in the Option Exercises and Stock Vested table on page 38. 
Restricted Stock. In limited circumstances, such as special retention, recognition and succession planning needs, the Committee may make a separate award of restricted stock. Awards of restricted stock are highly selective and may result in compensation above the median range. The Committee views this program as an important management succession planning and retention tool. The objective is to lock in top executives and their potential replacements identified through the succession planning process. Restricted stock provides participants with dividends and voting rights beginning on the award date. There is no set frequency of restricted stock awards, and they are granted with long-term cliff vesting periods of up to 10 years and no less than 3 years. 
In fiscal 2018, the Committee granted shares of restricted stock as follows: F. J. Dellaquila, 10,000 shares; M. H. Train, 20,000 shares; S. J. Pelch, 10,000 shares; R. T. Sharp, 20,000 shares. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Stock Options. Stock option awards are still available for granting under our long-term incentive plans; however, no stock option awards have been made to any of the NEOs since 2015. When utilized, stock option awards are issued at no less than fair market value on the date of the award and generally vest over a period of three years. We do not pay dividend equivalents on stock options and do not "reprice" awards. 
Policies Supporting Our Fundamental Principles 
To support our pay-for-performance philosophy and underlying fundamental principles of our compensation programs, we have implemented certain policies regarding NEO ownership of and actions in connection with stock and other incentive compensation. In addition to our compensation programs, we believe that appropriate stock ownership guidelines and our stock trading, clawback and pledging and anti-hedging policies further align the interests of our executives with shareholders by encouraging long-term superior performance without encouraging excessive or unnecessary risk taking.

Severance, Executive Termination and Retirement 
Emerson does not have employment agreements, severance agreements or golden parachute agreements with the NEOs. The terms of all executive terminations and retirements are determined by the Committee individually based on specific facts and circumstances and not on formulaic rules. We follow these general principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We do not pay lump sum, non-forfeitable cash severance payments.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As permitted under shareholder-approved plans, departing plan participants, including NEOs, may have additional time to  exercise stock options, up to the time permitted in the original grants.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee may allow continuation (without accelerated vesting) of previously granted performance shares or restricted  stock awards, which would be paid if and when the Company achieves specified performance targets or time vesting requirements are met.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Departing executives sign extended non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements, and/or reaffirm existing agreements on these matters. Executives forfeit awards if they breach their non-competition, non-solicitation or confidentiality agreements.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee has adopted an Executive Officer Severance Policy which provides that the Company shall not implement individual severance or change of control agreements providing certain benefits (as described in the Policy) to any NEO in excess of 2.99 times the sum of the NEO's then current base salary and most recent cash bonus without shareholder ratification. The policy is located at www.Emerson.com, Investors, Corporate Governance, Executive Officer Severance Policy. E. L. Monser, our former President, retired effective October 1, 2018. We entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Monser which, among other things, reaffirmed and extended his restrictive covenants. Please see "Description of E. L. Monser Letter Agreement" at page 43 below for a description of his retirement arrangements. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Change of Control 
If a change of control occurs, we protect all employees who participate in long-term stock plans, the Savings Investment Restoration Plan and the Pension Restoration Plan as described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control" at page 40 below. Our 2011 Stock Option Plan and 2015 Incentive Shares Plan include a "double trigger" for vesting following a change of control, although stock awards under our prior stock option and incentive shares plans vest upon a change of control. When triggered, we would expect to accelerate vesting of stock awards and pay accrued benefits under the Savings Investment Restoration Plan and the Pension Restoration Plan. We do not credit additional years of service under any plans, or continue medical or other benefits. We do not make additional cash payments related to stock compensation plans. We do not increase payouts to cover payment of taxes and do not provide tax gross-ups. 
Security and Perquisites 
Due to increased security risks inherent in senior executive positions, we provide NEOs with residential security monitoring and personal security as needed. The Company's security policy and the Board require that the Chairman and CEO use Company aircraft for all travel to promote business efficiency and safety. The Company provides limited personal use of Company aircraft to the other NEOs. All NEOs reimburse the Company at first class rates for personal use. The Company also provides NEOs with cars, club memberships, financial planning and an annual physical. These are long-standing perquisites that assist in retaining and attracting executives and that we believe are similar to those often provided at other similarly-sized companies. NEOs and other employees may receive Company tickets for sporting or other events. The Committee reviews these perquisites annually. Total perquisite costs and related information appear in the Summary Compensation Table on page 33. The Company does not provide any reimbursement for taxes on perquisites. 
Other Benefits 
The NEOs are eligible for Company-provided benefits that are generally available to all other employees, including a qualified 401(k) savings plan, a qualified defined-benefit pension plan, medical, life and disability insurance and a charitable matching gifts program, among others. The defined-benefit pension is being phased out, but a majority of U.S. employees, including the NEOs, continue to participate. The following additional benefits are also available to the NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nonqualified savings plans which allow the NEOs to defer up to 20 percent of cash compensation and continue to  receive the Company match after reaching the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) qualified plan limits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A nonqualified defined-benefit pension plan, which provides benefits based on the qualified plan without regard to IRS  limits but does not provide additional credited years of service. Participation is by award and based on the executive's individual contributions and long-term service to the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Term life insurance coverage.  
[END TABLE]
Regulatory Considerations 
IRC Section 162(m) imposes a $1 million limit on the Company's deductions for compensation paid to specified executive officers ("Covered Employees"). For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, the Covered Employees consisted of a corporation's chief executive officer and up to three other highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer), and qualifying "performance-based compensation" was not subject to this limitation if specified requirements were met (i.e., compensation paid only if performance meets pre-established objective goals based on performance criteria approved by shareholders). 
Pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, (i) the remuneration of a public corporation's chief financial officer is now also subject to the deduction limit, (ii) once an individual is considered a Covered Employee with respect to a taxable year, he or she will be considered a Covered Employee for all future years, including after termination of employment or death, and (iii) the exemption from the deduction limit for "performance-based compensation" is no longer available. These changes do not apply to remuneration provided under a binding written contract in effect on November 2, 2017, which is not materially modified after that date. Consequently, for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, no remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to a Covered Employee will be deductible unless such compensation is granted pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect prior to November 2, 2017. 
The Company's incentive compensation plans are generally designed to ensure tax deductibility under Section 162(m). However, time-based restricted stock awards do not qualify under Section 162(m), and the Committee retains the flexibility to design and administer compensation programs that are in the best interests of Emerson and its shareholders. 
NEO cash bonuses are discretionary, subject to maximum amounts based on the Section 162(m) performance objectives selected by the Committee annually from among the objectives identified in the annual incentive plan. The objectives are not communicated to 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
participants as targets. The 2018 performance objective was earnings per share. Based on fiscal 2018 performance, the maximum amount of bonus that could be paid to each covered NEO was as follows: D. N. Farr, $9.36 million; E. L. Monser, $4.68 million; F. J. Dellaquila, $3.51 million; M. H. Train, $3.51 million; S. J. Pelch, $3.51 million; and R. T. Sharp $3.51 million. The Committee may exercise "negative discretion" to reduce the award below these amounts based on an assessment of performance. Our compensation plans also comply with IRC Section 409A for nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements. 
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, for financial statement purposes we expense all equity-based awards over the period earned, or subsequently, based upon their estimated grant date fair value, depending on the terms of the award. FASB ASC Topic 718 has not resulted in any significant changes in our compensation program design. 
Equity Compensation Grant Practices 
The Committee approves all grants of equity compensation to executive officers, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act. All elements of executive officer compensation are reviewed by the Committee annually at its October or November meetings. Generally, equity awards are made at those meetings, but may be made at other meetings. The Committee meeting date, or the next business day if the meeting is on a non-business day, is the grant date for equity awards. The Committee has delegated to the CEO authority to grant stock options (1) to employees other than corporate officers and business unit Presidents, subject to the Committee's prior approval of the aggregate number awarded, and (2) in connection with retention, promotion and acquisitions, which he uses on an infrequent basis. This delegation of authority does not extend to executive officers or other officers who are subject to the Company's trading blackout policy. 
Summary Compensation Table Analysis 
Mr. Farr's total compensation for 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily as result of an increase in performance shares awards and an increased bonus due to the Company's outstanding financial performance and other factors discussed above. Mr. Farr's total compensation as shown in the Summary Compensation Table also includes an amount for the actuarial change in his pension value. This amount was significantly higher in 2016 compared to 2017 and 2018 as a result of a lower applicable discount rate in 2016, over which the Committee has no control. No changes were made in the method of calculating NEO benefits. 
Total compensation in the table for the other NEOs for 2018 was comparable to 2017. Mr. Pelch's total compensation was increased due to his promotion effective December 31, 2017. Total compensation for certain NEOs was also impacted by changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension benefits.

  (a)  The perquisites provided are: tax and financial planning, leased Company car, club fees, annual physical, tickets for  sporting or other events and costs related to personal security provided to each of the NEOs under the Company's security program. The Company's Board of Directors and its security program require that the Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer use Company aircraft for all business and personal air travel. Mr. Farr reimburses the Company for personal air travel at first class rates. The Company also provides limited personal use of Company aircraft outside of the security  program to the other NEOs, who also provide such reimbursement. Amounts for personal use of Company aircraft represent the incremental cost to the Company, calculated based on the variable operating costs per hour of operation, which include fuel  costs, maintenance, and associated travel costs for the crew, less reimbursements. For Mr. Farr, the incremental amount of personal use of Company aircraft was $359,483, which is included in the perquisites amount above.

(3)  Includes the grant date fair value of awards of restricted stock and performance shares computed in accordance with FASB  ASC Topic 718, applying the same valuation model and assumptions applied for financial reporting purposes. These amounts do not correspond to the actual value that will be realized by the NEOs. For performance awards, the grant date fair value  included assumes the target award is earned. Amounts expensed for performance shares awards in the Company's financial statements during the performance period reflect the grant date fair value of the award expensed over the performance period,  adjusted to current value each year, which varies depending upon stock price and the probability that targets will be reached, and therefore will generally not be equal to the grant date fair value reported above. For restricted stock, the aggregate  amount that the Company would expense in its yearly financial statements over the vesting period is equal to the grant date fair value reported above. See Note 15 to the Company's fiscal 2018 financial statements in the Company's Annual  Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the determination of these amounts.

Pension Benefits 
Below is information on the pension benefits for the NEOs under each of the following pension plans. 
Emerson Retirement Plan 
The Emerson Electric Co. Retirement Plan is a tax-qualified retirement program that covered approximately 60,000 participants on September 30, 2018, including the NEOs. Plan benefits are based primarily on a formula that considers the highest consecutive five-year average of the executive's annual cash earnings, base salary plus bonus (final average earnings), not to exceed the IRS-prescribed limit applicable to tax-qualified plans ($270,000 for fiscal 2018). 
The plan provides an annual benefit accrual for each year of service of 1.0% of final average earnings up to "covered compensation" and 1.5% of final average earnings in excess of "covered compensation," limited to 35 years of service. When the employee has attained 35 years of service, the annual accrual is 1.0% of final average earnings. "Covered compensation" is based on the average of Social Security taxable wage bases, and varies per individual based on Social Security retirement age. A small portion of the accrued benefits payable from the plan for Messrs. Farr, Train and Pelch includes benefits determined under different but lesser pension formulas for periods of prior service at Company business units. In addition, Mr. Train is no longer accruing pension benefit service under the plan. 
The accumulated benefit that an employee earns over his or her career with the Company is payable upon retirement as a monthly annuity for life with a guaranteed minimum term of five years. The normal retirement age for this plan is 65. Employees who have attained age 55 and 10 years of service are eligible to retire early under the plan. As of September 30, 2018, Messrs. Farr and Dellaquila are eligible for early retirement. If an employee retires before age 65, the accrued benefit is reduced for the number of years prior to age 65 that the benefit commences (4% for each of the first five years that retirement precedes age 65, and 5% for each additional year). Employees vest in their accrued benefit after five years of service. The plan provides for spousal joint and survivor annuity options. No employee contributions are required. 
Benefits under the plan are subject to the limitations under IRC Section 415, which in fiscal 2018 is $220,000 per year for a single life annuity payable at an IRS-prescribed retirement age. This limitation may be actuarially adjusted in accordance with IRS rules for items such as other forms of distribution and different annuity starting dates. 
COMPENSATION TABLES 
Emerson Pension Restoration Plan 
The Emerson Electric Co. Pension Restoration Plan is a non-qualified plan that is an unfunded obligation of the Company. Benefits are payable from the Company's general operating funds. Participation in, and benefits payable from, the plan are by award, subject to Compensation Committee approval. A participant who terminates employment with a vested retirement benefit will receive at age 65 or later termination of employment a benefit based on the same final average earnings formula as described above for the Emerson Retirement Plan, for all years of service at Emerson, and not subject to the IRS-prescribed limitations on benefits and compensation applicable to the Emerson Retirement Plan. The benefit payable from the Pension Restoration Plan is reduced by the benefit received from the Emerson Retirement Plan. Benefits payable from the Pension Restoration Plan are generally payable as a monthly annuity for life with a guaranteed minimum term of five years, provided that in certain circumstances a participant or a participant's beneficiary may be eligible to receive a lump sum payment. If an NEO is terminated for cause or engages in actions that adversely affect the Company, the benefits may be forfeited. No pension benefits were paid to any of the NEOs during fiscal 2018. 
The amounts reported in the table below equal the present value of the accumulated benefit at September 30, 2018 for the NEOs under each plan based upon the assumptions described in footnote (2).

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
The Emerson Electric Co. Savings Investment Restoration Plan ("Savings Investment Restoration Plan") is a nonqualified, unfunded defined contribution plan. The plan provides benefits that would have been provided under the Emerson Electric Co. Employee Savings Investment Plan, the Company's qualified 401(k) plan (the "ESIP"), but could not be provided due to IRC qualified plan compensation limits. 
Participants in the Savings Investment Restoration Plan are designated by the Compensation Committee. Participants may defer up to 20% of compensation and the Company will make matching contributions for participants who defer at least 5% of compensation in an amount equal to 50% of the first 5% of those deferrals (not to exceed 2.5% of compensation less the maximum matching amount the participant could have received under the ESIP). Compensation generally includes cash pay (base salary and annual bonus) received by a participant, including employee ESIP contributions, and excludes any reimbursements, awards or other payments under equity compensation plans, stock option gains, any severance payments and other incentive payments. Amounts deferred under the plan are 100% vested and will be credited with returns based on the same investment alternatives selected by the participant under the ESIP, 
COMPENSATION TABLES 
which include an Emerson common stock fund and more than 20 other mutual fund investment alternatives. The Company matching contributions vest 20% each year for the first 5 years of service, after which the participant is 100% vested in all contributions. The matching contributions are credited to a book-entry account reflecting units equivalent to Emerson stock. There are no "above-market earnings" as all earnings are market-based consistent with the investment funds elected. All deferred amounts and Company matching contributions are accounted for on the Company's financial statements and are unfunded obligations of the Company and paid in cash when benefit payments commence. 
Generally, distribution of vested account balances occurs in a lump sum no later than one year following termination of employment. Upon retirement, or in other certain instances, participants may receive their account balances in up to 10 equal annual installments, if previously elected. Unvested matching contributions become fully vested upon (i) retirement with Compensation Committee approval on or after the age of 55, (ii) death or disability, (iii) termination of the plan, or (iv) a change of control of the Company. All or a portion of any participant's vested account balance may be distributed earlier in the event of an unforeseeable emergency, if approved by the Compensation Committee. For amounts deferred or vested as of December 31, 2004, a participant may receive a distribution of after-tax deferrals upon 30 days' notice.

[END TABLE]
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control 
As described above, the NEOs do not have any written or oral employment agreements with the Company and have no other agreements that contain severance or "golden parachute" provisions. As described on page 43, the terms and conditions of Mr. Monser's retirement are set forth in a letter agreement. Please see "Description of E. L. Monser Letter Agreement" on page 43. 
The information below generally describes payments or benefits under the Company's compensation plans and arrangements that would be available to all participants in the plans, including the NEOs, in the event of the participant's termination of employment or of a Change of Control of the Company. Any such payments or benefits that an NEO has elected to defer would be provided in accordance with IRC Section 409A. Payments or benefits under other plans and arrangements that are generally available to the Company's employees on similar terms are not described. 
Conditions and Obligations Applicable to Receipt of Termination/Change of Control Payments 
In the event of any termination or Change of Control, all executives participating in stock options, performance shares, restricted stock or the Pension Restoration Plan have the following obligations to the Company. 
Stock Options. NEOs are obligated to keep Company information confidential, assign to the Company intellectual property rights, and, during and for one year after termination, not compete with, or solicit the employees of, the Company. 
COMPENSATION TABLES 
Performance Shares and Restricted Stock. NEOs are obligated not to compete with, or solicit the employees of, the Company during and for two years after termination. 
Pension Restoration Plan. If an NEO is discharged for cause, enters into competition with the Company, interferes with the Company's relations with a customer, or engages in any activity that would result in a decrease in sales by the Company, the NEO's rights to benefits under the Plan will be forfeited, unless the Compensation Committee determines that the activity is not detrimental to the Company. 
Additionally, upon retirement or involuntary termination, NEOs generally execute letter agreements reaffirming their applicable confidentiality, non-competition and non-solicitation obligations and may enter into extended non-competition agreements. 
Payments Made Upon Retirement

If an NEO's employment terminates for any other reason (i.e., voluntary termination, termination for cause or involuntary termination), he or she would only receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payment of the vested portion of the NEO's Savings Investment Restoration Plan account, in a single lump sum after  termination.  
[END TABLE]
Under the Company's compensation plans and arrangements, the Compensation Committee may also, in its discretion, determine whether to provide any additional payments or benefits to the NEO. This exercise of discretion is unlikely to result in any additional benefits in the case of a voluntary resignation or termination for cause. This includes the discretion to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Determine whether any annual cash bonus award would be paid, subject to satisfaction of  pre-established performance conditions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If termination occurs with Company consent, the Compensation Committee may allow the NEO up to three months after  termination, up to the original option term, to exercise vested stock options;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Determine whether the NEO would receive full, partial or no payout of performance shares after the performance period and  subject to satisfaction of pre-established performance conditions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Determine whether to allow the NEO to continue to vest in restricted stock, or to reduce the vesting period to not less  than three years; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Determine whether an NEO terminated for cause or for engaging in actions that adversely affect the Company will forfeit  the right to receive vested benefits under the Pension Restoration Plan starting after the later of age 65 or termination, paid in the form of a monthly annuity or a lump sum distribution.  
[END TABLE]
Payments Made Upon Change of Control 
Upon a Change of Control, the Company's compensation plans and arrangements provide as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash bonus awards are not paid;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All unvested stock options become fully exercisable if either the options have not been appropriately assumed by the  acquiror, or within two years after the change of control, the optionee is involuntarily terminated other than for cause, the optionee's title, duties or responsibilities are adversely changed, or the optionee is required to relocate;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance objectives of outstanding performance shares awards would be deemed satisfied, with payout made immediately.  For performance shares granted under the shareholder approved 2015 Incentive Shares Plan, performance objectives would be deemed satisfied at the highest level provided for in the award, if a "double trigger" event occurs, meaning that in  connection with a change of control (a) the award has not been appropriately assumed or an equivalent award substituted by the acquiror, (b) cash is the primary form of consideration paid to shareholders, or (c) following the change  of control, the holder is involuntarily terminated other than for cause, or within two years after the change of control, the holder's title, duties or responsibilities are adversely changed, or the holder is required to relocate by more than  50 miles;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All restricted stock awarded under the 2006 Incentive Shares Plan would vest immediately. Restricted stock and restricted  stock units awarded under the 2015 Incentive Shares Plan would vest immediately if a "double trigger" event (as defined above) occurs;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The NEO would vest in all unvested Company contributions to the Savings Investment Restoration Plan, and the vested amount  would be paid in a single lump sum; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An NEO participating in the Pension Restoration Plan would become fully vested and could elect immediate payment in the  form of a lump sum or a life annuity. In early fiscal 2016, for benefits accruing after 2004, the Plan was amended to conform the assumptions used in calculating lump sums payable to the assumptions used by the Company to accrue liabilities with  respect to U.S. retirement plans for financial reporting purposes, as set forth in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
[END TABLE]
"Change of Control" Definition 
"Change of Control" generally means: (i) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the Company's common stock, (ii) individuals who currently make up the Company's Board of Directors (or who subsequently become Directors after being approved for election by at least a majority of current Directors) ceasing to make up at least a majority of the Board, or (iii) approval by the Company's shareholders of (a) a reorganization, merger or consolidation which results in the ownership of 50% or more of the Company's common stock by persons or entities that were not previously shareholders; (b) a liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or (c) the sale of substantially all of the Company's assets. With respect to participants who have deferred payment of earned awards under the 2006 Incentive Shares Plan, and as provided for in the 2015 Incentive Shares Plan, the Change of Control must also meet the requirements of IRC Section 409A and any transaction referenced in (iii) above must have actually occurred, rather than merely have been approved. With respect to the Company's Pension Restoration Plan and Savings Investment Restoration Plan, a Change of Control refers to a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company, as such terms are defined under IRC Section 409A and the regulations promulgated thereunder. 
COMPENSATION TABLES 
Description of E. L. Monser Letter Agreement 
E. L. Monser retired on October 1, 2018. On October 2, 2018, the Company and Mr. Monser entered into a letter agreement in connection with his retirement. Under the letter agreement, Mr. Monser agreed, among other things: (i) not to compete with, or solicit to hire the employees of, the Company or any of its affiliates during a period of five years from his date of retirement; (ii) not to use or disclose any confidential information of the Company; (iii) to reaffirm all existing non-compete, invention, non-disclosure and non-solicitation obligations he has to the Company and (iv) comply with non-disparagement obligations. Mr. Monser also released and discharged the Company, its affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from any and all claims or liabilities of whatever nature, and will remain subject to the Company's clawback policy. 
Mr. Monser remained eligible to receive his 2018 annual bonus based on Company financial performance. Mr. Monser remained eligible to receive a full payout of any earned award under the Fiscal 2016–2018 Performance Shares Program and remains eligible to receive a full payout under the Fiscal 2017–2019 Performance Shares Program, subject to the Company's achievement of the performance objectives. Mr. Monser has agreed to remain available for consulting on an as needed basis. In consideration for his availability, Mr. Monser may receive up to a 50% pro rata earned payout of the performance shares awarded to him under the Company's Fiscal 2018–2020 Performance Shares Program, subject to the Company's achievement of the performance objectives, which amount will be determined and paid at the times provided for under the 2018 Program. The agreement reduced his maximum payout opportunity from 155% to 125% with respect to the 2018 Program. Mr. Monser's vested options will remain exercisable for five years following retirement, but no longer than the original term of each option. In addition, Mr. Monser's restricted stock awards will continue to vest in accordance with their terms. Please see the "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table" at page 36 above for more information on these awards. 
Mr. Monser will be eligible to receive monthly pension benefits earned under the Company's qualified and non-qualified pension plans. He will also be eligible to receive distributions from the Company's qualified and non-qualified 401(k) retirement savings plans. 
If Mr. Monser violates any of his obligations to the Company under the letter agreement, he will forfeit all payments to be made or benefits provided under the letter agreement, and will repay to the Company, as liquidated damages, one-half of the economic value of all benefits provided to him under the letter agreement prior to the date of breach. 
Quantification of Payments and Benefits 
The following tables quantify the potential payments and benefits upon termination or a Change of Control of the Company for each of the NEOs, assuming the NEO's employment terminated on September 30, 2018, given the NEO's compensation and service level as of that date and, if applicable, based on the Company's closing share price of $76.58 on that date. Other assumptions made with respect to specific payments or benefits are set forth in applicable footnotes to the tables. See "Description of E. L. Monser Letter Agreement" above for a description of Mr. Monser's retirement arrangements. Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any payments or benefits provided upon a termination or Change of Control, including, but not limited to, the date of any such event, the Company's stock price and the NEO's, any actual amounts paid or distributed may be different. None of the payments set forth below would be grossed-up for taxes.

Pay Ratio Disclosure 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of 
Regulation S-K, we determined the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO compared to the annual total compensation of our median employee. 
As is permitted under the SEC rules, to determine our median employee, we chose "Base Pay, Shift Premium and Overtime, Bonus and Commission or equivalent" as our consistently applied compensation measure. Using a determination date of July 1, 2018, we calculated the median wages for 80,723 employees. We excluded employees in the following 5 countries (4.95% of the global workforce), under the 5% de Minimis rule: Hungary (600), Indonesia (33), The Philippines (3,023), Slovakia (323) and Ukraine (18). 
Applying a valid statistical sampling methodology to the remaining 76,726 employees, we then produced a sample of employees who were paid within a 5% range of that median and selected an employee from within that group as our median employee. We determined that the 2018 Summary Compensation Table total compensation and value of nondiscriminatory benefits for our CEO and median employee were $15,619,741 and $36,791, which includes $10,214 in company provided medical and dental benefits for our CEO. Our estimate of the ratio of CEO pay to median worker pay is 425:1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated using a methodology consistent with the SEC rules, as described above. 
As the SEC rules allow for companies to adopt a wide range of methodologies, to apply country exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices to identify the median employee and calculate the CEO pay ratio, the pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.

Proxy Item No. 2: 
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM 
In accordance with its Charter, the Audit Committee has selected KPMG LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2019. KPMG LLP served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2018 and has been retained continuously as the Company's external auditor for more than 50 years. 
The members of the Audit Committee believe that the continued retention of KPMG LLP is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Audit Committee is asking the shareholders to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. 
The Audit Committee is not required to take any action as a result of the outcome of this ratification vote. In the event shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee may reconsider this appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Committee determines that such a change would be in the Company's and the shareholders' best interests. 
The Audit Committee has approved in advance all services provided by KPMG LLP. A member of KPMG LLP will be present at the meeting with the opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions from shareholders. 
OUR BOARD AND AUDIT COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND A VOTE 
"FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S

Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act and SEC rules, our Board of Directors is again submitting for a non-binding shareholder vote our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement (commonly referred to as "say-on-pay"). We plan to hold this vote annually. 
Emerson is a performance-driven, financially focused company with a long track record of strong performance in good economic times, and stable profitability and returns to shareholders even when economic conditions are unfavorable. Our pay for performance executive compensation program is an integral part of our consistent and rigorous management process. We believe it has effectively motivated and rewarded Emerson executives to meet the challenges of recessions, inflationary periods, technological changes and intense global competition, and it continues to do so today. 
We encourage shareholders to review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 19 to 32. The Company's executive compensation program supports Emerson's rigorously-applied management, organizational review and compensation planning processes, which have been implemented over the years by successive teams of talented and committed executives. 
The foundational elements of our program include paying for performance, maximizing shareholder value without excessive risk, aligning executive and shareholder interests, providing competitive pay to attract and retain executives and rewarding results while recognizing individual contributions. 
We believe the program strikes the appropriate balance between responsible, measured pay practices and incentivizing our executives to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our shareholders, as evidenced by Emerson's pay practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay for Performance. NEO compensation is tied to Company performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We Target Competitive and Market Based Pay with Actual Pay Dependent on Performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-Term Performance. Our primary incentive compensation – performance shares – is based on the  Company's achievement of established financial objectives over a minimum three year performance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maximize Shareholder Value While Mitigating Risk. Our performance shares program is based on above-market growth  targets and rewards growth over the long term, discouraging short-term risk taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Alignment with Shareholders. We have substantial stock ownership requirements, which our NEOs greatly exceed, and  blackout, clawback, pledging and anti-hedging policies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Tax Gross-Ups. We do not provide tax gross-ups to our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Employment, Severance or Golden Parachute Agreements with any of our NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-compete, Non-solicitation and Confidentiality Agreements. We require executives to enter into non-competition,  non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements as a condition of all equity awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Double Trigger Change of Control. We utilize double trigger provisions on change of control in our 2011 Stock  Option Plan and in our 2015 Incentive Shares Plan.  
[END TABLE]
We regularly evaluate the individual elements of our compensation program in light of market conditions and governance requirements and make changes as appropriate for Emerson's business. 
The Board strongly endorses the Company's executive compensation program and recommends that the shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in this proxy statement under "Executive Compensation" and "Compensation Tables", including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular and narrative disclosure contained in this proxy statement. 
Because the vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board or the Compensation Committee, and neither the Board nor the Compensation Committee will be required to take any action as a result of the vote. The Compensation Committee will carefully evaluate the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. After our Annual Meeting on February 5, 2019, we expect that the next say-on-pay vote will occur at our next Annual Meeting scheduled to be held on February 4, 2020. 
OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE 
"FOR" THIS PROPOSAL.

Questions and Answers About the 2019 Annual Meeting 
1. Why did I receive these materials? 
Our Board of Directors is soliciting proxies on its behalf to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on February 5, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., Central Time, at the Headquarters of the Company, 8000 W. Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63136. The proxies also may be voted at any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. All properly executed written proxies, and all properly completed proxies submitted by telephone or by the internet, that are delivered pursuant to this solicitation will be voted at the meeting in accordance with the directions given in the proxy, unless the proxy is earlier revoked. 
2. How are these materials being distributed? 
On or about December 14, 2018, we began mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to certain shareholders of record as of November 27, 2018, and posted our proxy materials for shareholder access at www.proxyvote.com. As more fully described in the Notice, shareholders may also request printed proxy materials. The Notice and website also provide information regarding how you may request proxy materials in printed or electronic form or electronically on an ongoing basis. We also mailed proxy materials to certain shareholders. 
3. Why am I getting these materials from my broker, bank or other nominee, and not directly from Emerson?
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may also receive either the Notice or printed proxy materials from that entity, as required by SEC rules. 
4. What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a shareholder who holds shares in street name? 
If your shares are registered in your name on the books and records of our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are a shareholder of record. If your shares are held for you in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares are held in street name. 
5. What is the record date and what does it mean? Who can vote? 
The record date for the 2019 Annual Meeting is November 27, 2018 ("record date"). The record date was established by our Board under Missouri law. Holders of Emerson common stock at the close of business on the record date are entitled to receive notice of and vote at the meeting, or in the case of holders in street name, provide voting instructions to their broker, bank or other nominee. Each shareholder of record on the record date is entitled to one vote for each share of our common stock held on that date. There is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of Directors. On the record date, there were issued and entitled to be voted 623,121,869 shares of our common stock, par value $0.50 per share. 
6. What are the different methods I can use to vote my shares? 
By Telephone or Internet: All shareholders of record may vote their shares by telephone (within the United States, U.S. territories and Canada, there is no charge for the call) or by internet, using the procedures and instructions described on the proxy card, notice of internet availability of proxy materials and other enclosures. If you vote by telephone or internet, you need not mail back your proxy card. A control number, located on the proxy card or Notice, must be provided to verify your identity and allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded. 
Street name holders may vote by telephone or internet if their brokers, banks or other nominees make those methods available. Each broker, bank or other nominee will enclose instructions with the proxy materials. Follow the voting instructions on the form you receive from that firm. 
In Writing: All shareholders also may vote by mailing their completed and signed proxy card (in the case of shareholders of record) or their completed and signed voting instruction form (in the case of street name holders). 
In Person: All shareholders of record may vote in person at the meeting. Street name holders must obtain a legal proxy from their broker, bank or other nominee and bring the legal proxy to the meeting in order to vote in person at the meeting. 
7. How many votes must be present to hold the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
To conduct the meeting, a majority of our issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote as of the record date for the meeting November 27, 2018, must be present in person or by proxy at the meeting. This is referred to as a quorum. 
Your shares are counted as present at the meeting if you attend the meeting and vote in person or if you properly vote by internet, telephone or mail. Abstentions, proxies which are marked or voted to deny discretionary authority on other matters and shares of record held by a broker, bank or other nominee ("broker shares") that are voted on any matter are also included in determining the number of shares present. Broker shares that are not voted on any matter will not be included in determining whether a quorum is present. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING 
8. What vote is required to pass the proposals? 
If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares entitled to vote which are present in person or represented by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting is required to elect Directors, to ratify the appointment of KPMG, to approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs and to act on any other matters properly brought before the meeting. 
Shares represented by proxies which are marked or voted "withhold authority" with respect to the election of any one or more nominees for election as Directors, proxies which are marked or voted "abstain" on the other proposals, and proxies which are marked or voted to deny discretionary authority on other matters will be counted for the purpose of determining the number of shares represented by proxy at the meeting. Such proxies will thus have the same effect as a vote against such nominee or nominees, against such proposals and against such other matters, respectively. 
9. What if I do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy? 
If your proxy card is signed and returned without specifying choices, the shares will be voted FOR the nominees for Director in Proposal 1, FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm in Proposal 2 and FOR the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's NEOs in Proposal 3. Otherwise, signed proxy cards without specified choices will be voted in the discretion of the proxies. 
10. How will my shares be voted on any other matters to come before the meeting? 
The Company knows of no other matters to come before the meeting. If any other matters properly come before the meeting, the proxies solicited hereby will be voted on such matters in the discretion of the persons voting such proxies, who are members of the Company's management, except proxies which are marked to deny discretionary authority. The Company knows of no reason why any of the nominees for Director named herein would be unable to serve. In the event, however, that any nominee named should prior to the election become unable to serve as a Director, your proxy (unless designated to the contrary) will be voted for such other person or persons, if any, as the Board of Directors of the Company may recommend. 
11. Will my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy or voting instructions? 
Shareholders of Record: If you are a shareholder of record, your shares will not be voted if you do not provide your proxy or vote in person at the meeting. It is, therefore, important that you vote your shares. 
Street Name Holders: If your shares are held in street name and you do not provide your voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, your shares may be voted by your broker, bank or other nominee only on certain "routine" matters, pursuant to rules of the NYSE. 
Only the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is considered a "routine" matter for which brokers, banks or other nominees may vote uninstructed shares. The other proposals to be voted on at the meeting are not considered "routine" under NYSE rules. If you do not provide voting instructions on a non-routine matter, your broker may indicate on the proxy that it does not have discretionary voting authority and your shares will not be voted on that matter, which is referred to as a "broker non-vote." Broker non-votes will not be considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to that matter and thus will have no effect on the outcome of the vote with regard to such matters. 
12. How can I revoke a proxy or change my vote? 
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted (in the case of proxy cards) by giving notice to the Secretary of the Company or by executing and mailing a later-dated proxy. To revoke a proxy, or change your vote cast, by telephone or internet, you must do so by telephone or internet, respectively (following the directions on your proxy card), by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on February 4, 2019. If your shares are held in street name, you should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee to revoke or change your voting instructions 
13. Who will pay the cost of this proxy solicitation?
The solicitation will be by internet and mail and the expense thereof will be paid by the Company. The Company has retained Saratoga Proxy Consulting, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies at an estimated cost of $15,000 plus expenses. In addition, solicitation of proxies may be made by additional mailings, electronic mail, telephone or in person by Directors, officers or other employees of the Company and we may request brokerage houses, banks and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward soliciting material to the beneficial owners of shares held of record by such persons. We will reimburse such persons for expenses incurred in forwarding such soliciting material.

15. What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card? 
It means that you have multiple accounts with brokers and/or our transfer agent.

We recommend that you contact your bank or broker, or our transfer agent, to consolidate as many accounts as possible under the same name and address.

16. May shareholders ask questions at the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
Yes. The Chairman will answer shareholders' questions during the Q&A period of the meeting. In order to provide an opportunity for everyone who wishes to ask a question, each shareholder will be limited to two minutes. Shareholders may ask a second question only after all others have first had their turn and if time allows. When speaking, shareholders must direct questions to the Chairman and confine their questions to matters that relate directly to the business of the meeting. 
Other Matters 
Future Shareholder Proposals and Nominations 
Proposals for Inclusion in Proxy Statement Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 
Proposals of shareholders intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting scheduled to be held on February 4, 2020, must be received by the Company by August 16, 2019 for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and proxy relating to that meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act. Upon receipt of any such proposal, the Company will determine whether or not to include such proposal in the proxy statement and proxy in accordance with regulations governing the solicitation of proxies. 
Proposals and Nominations Not for Inclusion in Proxy Statement 
In accordance with our Bylaws, a shareholder who intends to submit an item of business, including a Director nomination or other proposal, outside of our proxy statement, at an Annual Meeting must comply with the requirements of our Bylaws including the provision of timely notice to the Secretary of Emerson in advance of the meeting. To be timely, a shareholder's notice ordinarily must be received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 90 nor more than 120 days before the meeting, i.e., between October 7 and November 6, 2019 for the 2020 Annual Meeting. However, if the Company gives less than 100 days' (1) notice of the meeting or (2) prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting, then such notice must be received within 10 days after notice of the meeting is mailed or other public disclosure of the meeting is made. 
A shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth (i) as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the Annual Meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the Annual Meeting, and (ii) as to the proposing shareholder(s) and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, and their respective affiliates or associates or others acting in concert therewith various "proposing shareholder information" as specified in detail in our Bylaws. This proposing shareholder information includes such information as material interests or arrangements, names and addresses, the number of shares beneficially owned, any derivative or hedging positions, any material interest in any contract with the Company or any affiliate or competitor, all information that would be required to be set forth in a Schedule 13D (or an amendment) if such a statement were required, any other information relating to any such person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or proxy contest, a representation whether any such person is or intends to participate in the solicitation of proxies, and a representation that the shareholder is a shareholder of record entitled to vote and intends to continue to hold such stock of the Company through the meeting. 
In addition to the proposing shareholder information, for Director nominations outside of our proxy statement, the notice shall also include, as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate, the information specified in detail in our Bylaws. Such information includes the name, age, business address and residence of such nominee, the principal occupation, the number of shares beneficially owned, any other information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for Director elections or is otherwise required, in certain cases details of any relationship, or understanding between the shareholder(s) and the nominee. 
Our Bylaws also set out specific eligibility requirements that nominees for Director must satisfy, which require nominees to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• complete and return a written questionnaire with respect to the background and qualification of the nominee and the  background of any other person or entity on whose behalf the nomination is being made; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a written representation and agreement that the nominee:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     is not and will not become a party to (1) any agreement or arrangement with, and has not given any commitment or  assurance to, any person as to how such nominee will act or vote (a Voting Commitment) that has not been disclosed to us or (2) any Voting Commitment that could limit or interfere with the nominees ability to comply with the  nominees fiduciary duties under applicable law;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     is not and will not become a party to any agreement or arrangement with any person with respect to any compensation,  reimbursement or indemnification in connection with service as a director that has not been disclosed therein; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ○     if elected, would be in compliance and will comply with all of our applicable corporate governance, conflict of interest,  confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
OTHER MATTERS 
These requirements are separate from the requirements a shareholder must meet to have a proposal included in the Company's proxy statement. The foregoing time limits also apply in determining whether notice is timely for purposes of rules adopted by the SEC relating to the exercise of discretionary voting authority. 
Director Nominees for Inclusion in Proxy Statement (Proxy Access) 
In August 2017, the Board amended the Bylaws to permit a holder (or a group of not more than 20 holders) of at least 3% of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater of two individuals or 20% of the Board, provided that the nominating holder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Bylaws, including providing the Company with advance notice of the nomination. Notice of director nominees submitted under these Bylaw provisions must be delivered to and received by the Secretary of the Company, whose address is 8000 West Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63136, no sooner than July 17, 2019 and no later than August 16, 2019, to be considered timely for purposes of the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting.

In each case the notice must be given to the Secretary of the Company, whose address is 8000 West Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63136. Any shareholder desiring a copy of the Company's Bylaws will be furnished one without charge upon written request to the Secretary.

Additional Filings 
The Company's Forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available without charge through the Company's website on the internet as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. They may be accessed as follows: www.Emerson.com, Investors, SEC filings. Information on our website does not constitute part of this proxy statement. 
Householding of Proxies 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for annual reports, proxy statements and notices of internet availability of proxy materials with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report, proxy statement and/or a notice of internet availability of proxy materials addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," can provide extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. The Company and some brokers household annual reports, proxy materials and notices of internet availability of proxy materials, delivering a single annual report, proxy statement and and/or notice of internet availability of proxy materials to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. 
Once you have received notice from your broker or the Company that your broker or the Company will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate annual report, proxy statement and notice of internet availability of proxy materials, or if you currently receive multiple copies of these documents and would prefer to participate in householding, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or us if you hold registered shares. You can notify us by sending a written request to Emerson Electric Co., 8000 West Florissant Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63136, Attn: Investor Relations, or by telephoning 314-553-2197 or by visiting our website. 
Appendix A 
EMERSON DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE STANDARDS 
In order to be considered independent under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, the Board must determine that a director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with Emerson Electric Co. ("Emerson"). The Board has established the following guidelines to assist it in determining director independence under the NYSE rules. Any Director who meets the following standards will be deemed independent by the Board: 
1. The Director was not employed by Emerson, and no immediate family member of the Director was employed by Emerson as an executive officer, within the preceding three years; 
2. The Director is not a partner or employee of Emerson's independent auditor, and no immediate family member of the Director is a partner of Emerson's independent auditor, or is employed by such auditor and personally works on Emerson's audit, and neither the Director nor any immediate family member has been within the preceding three years a partner of or employed by Emerson's independent auditor and has personally worked on Emerson's audit within that time; 
3. Neither the Director nor any immediate family member of the Director was employed as an executive officer by any company at the same time any Emerson executive officer served as a member of such company's compensation committee within the preceding three years; 
4. Neither the Director, nor any member of the Director's immediate family received in any twelve-month period during any of Emerson's last three fiscal years direct compensation in excess of $120,000 from Emerson other than regular director compensation, pension and other deferred payments that are not in any way contingent on continued service to Emerson, and compensation received by an immediate family member for service as a non-executive officer of Emerson; 
5. If the Director is an employee of, or if any immediate family member is an executive officer of, another organization that does business with Emerson, the annual sales to, or purchases from, Emerson by such company in each of the last three fiscal years were less than the greater of two percent of the annual revenues of such company or $1,000,000; 
6. If the Director is an executive officer of another organization which is indebted to Emerson, or to which Emerson is indebted, the total amount of either company's indebtedness to the other is less than two percent of the total consolidated assets of the company the Director serves as an executive officer; 
7. If the Director is, or is a director, executive officer or greater than 10% owner of an entity that is, a paid advisor, paid consultant or paid provider of professional services to Emerson, any member of Emerson's senior management or any immediate family member of a member of Emerson's senior management, the amount of such payments is less than the greater of 2% of such entity's annual revenues or $1,000,000 during Emerson's current fiscal year; 
8. If the Director is a partner, principal or counsel in a law firm that provides professional services to Emerson, the amount of payments for such services is less than the greater of 2% of such law firm's annual revenues or $1,000,000 during Emerson's current fiscal year; 
9. If the Director serves as an officer, director or trustee of a charitable organization to which Emerson makes contributions: (i) Emerson's discretionary contributions to such organization are less than the greater of two percent of such organization's total annual charitable receipts or $1 million; (ii) Emerson's contributions are normal matching charitable gifts and similar programs available to all employees and independent directors; or (iii) the charitable donation goes through the normal corporate charitable donation approval processes, and is not made "on behalf of" a Director; 
10. The Director's ownership of Emerson stock, direct or indirect, is less than 1% of the total outstanding Emerson stock; 
11. If the Director is affiliated with, or provides services to, an entity in which Emerson has an ownership interest, such ownership interest is less than 20%; and 
12. Any other relationship between the Director and Emerson not covered by the standards set forth above is an arrangement that is usually and customarily offered to customers of Emerson. 
If any relationship exists between Emerson and any Director that is not addressed by the standards set forth above, the Directors meeting these standards shall determine whether such relationship impairs the independence of such Director.
