Summary of Governance Practices
The Company is committed to governance practices that support our long-term strategy, demonstrate high levels of integrity, and earn the confidence of investors.
PROPOSAL 1: Election of Directors
The board is elected by the shareholders to represent their interest in the Company. With the exception of those matters reserved for shareholders, the board is the highest and ultimate decision-making authority. The board works closely with executive management and oversees the development and execution of our business strategy.
Board Complement
The Company maintains a classified board, meaning that only a portion of the board is elected each year. The classified structure provides stability of leadership and supports our long-term strategy. The board is divided into three classes in as equal number as possible. In general, the term of only one class expires each year, and the directors within that class are elected for a term of three years or until their successors are elected and qualified.
On November 26, 2018, the board received the resignations of Joseph S. Bracewell and Shaza L. Andersen. Mr. Bracewell's resignation was effective immediately, and Ms. Andersen's resignation was effective January 1, 2019.
Further, per the Company's bylaws, Dennis A. Starliper, having attained the age of 72, will retire from board service at the close of the annual meeting of shareholders. If all director-nominees are elected, following the annual meeting the board will stand at 13 members.
Director-Nominees 
A total of four directors are nominated for election as Class III directors for a three-year term expiring in 2022. They are Mona Abutaleb, Robert E. Henel, Jr., Mark C. Micklem, and Gary G. Nakamoto. With the exception of Mr. Micklem, all nominees currently serve on the board and have been elected previously by the shareholders. 
The board nominated Mr. Micklem for election as a director upon the recommendation of the Nominating Committee. Mr. Micklem was known to the members of the Nominating Committee as a result of having previously provided investment banking services to the Company.
Nomination Process
The Nominating Committee is responsible for recruiting and recommending candidates to the board. In exercising its duties, the committee considers the present skills and experience on the board and the qualifications that are desired in order to meet the Company's changing needs.
Our Corporate Governance Policy outlines the general competencies required of all directors including the highest standards in exercising his or her duty of loyalty, care and commitment to all of our shareholders. Prior to the recruitment of a new director, the board gathers input from all directors in order to form a collective picture of the particular competencies needed to fulfill the board's obligations and support our long-term strategy. Such competencies may include expertise in: the banking industry, financial matters, risk management, marketing, a geographic market, regional economics, strategic planning, executive management, technology or other relevant subjects. The board also values diversity and seeks to include a broad range of backgrounds, experience and personality styles.
The Nominating Committee encourages suggestions for qualified director candidates from the chief executive officer, the chairman of the board, other directors, and from shareholders, and is responsible for the evaluation of such suggestions. Shareholders may submit suggestions for qualified director candidates by writing to Ronald E. Kuykendall, General Counsel and Secretary, at Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., 17801 Georgia Avenue, Olney, Maryland 20832. Submissions should include information regarding a candidate's background, qualifications, experience and willingness to serve as a director. In addition, the Nominating Committee may consider candidates submitted by a third party search firm hired for this purpose. The Nominating Committee uses the same process for evaluating all nominees, including those recommended by shareholders, using the board membership criteria described above. Please see "Shareholder Proposals and Communications" on page 42.
Information About Nominees and Incumbent Directors
The information below sets forth the names of the nominees for election describing their skills, experience and qualifications for election. Each has given his or her consent to be nominated and has agreed to serve, if elected. If any person nominated by the board of directors is unable to stand for election, the shares represented by proxies may be voted for the election of such other person or persons as the present board of directors may designate.
Also provided is information on the background, skills, and experience of the remaining incumbent directors. Unless described otherwise, each director has held his or her current occupation for at least five years, and the ages listed are as of the Record Date.
Voting Standard for Uncontested Elections
With respect to the election of directors, a plurality of all the votes cast at the annual meeting will be sufficient to elect a nominee as a director. In an uncontested election, an incumbent director-nominee who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" than votes "for" shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the shareholder vote. The Nominating Committee shall consider the resignation, taking into consideration any information it deems to be appropriate and relevant, and make a recommendation to the board.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE NOMINEES NAMED BELOW AS A DIRECTOR OF SANDY SPRING BANCORP, INC.

Corporate Governance and Other Matters
The board is committed to setting a tone of the highest ethical standards and performance for our management, officers, and the Company as a whole. The board believes that strong corporate governance practices are a critical element of doing business today. To that end, the Corporate Governance Policy is reviewed regularly to ensure that it reflects the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The policy may be found on our investor relations website at www.sandyspringbank.com.
In addition, our board of directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct applicable to all directors, officers, and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. It sets forth the legal and ethical standards that govern the conduct of business performed by the Company and its subsidiaries. The Code of Business Conduct may be found on our investor relations website at www.sandyspringbank.com. Any future waivers or substantive amendments of the Codes of Business Conduct applicable to our directors and certain of our executive officers will be disclosed on our website.
Director Independence
The board of directors has affirmatively determined that all directors other than Mr. Schrider are independent. The board complies with or exceeds the independence requirements for the board and board committees established by the Nasdaq Stock Market, federal securities and banking laws and the additional standards included in our Corporate Governance Policy.
Plurality Plus Resignation Policy
In response to feedback from our shareholder engagement efforts, the board revised the Corporate Governance Policy in 2017 to require an incumbent director to promptly submit a letter of resignation if he or she receives more "withhold" votes than "for" votes in an uncontested election at an annual meeting of shareholders. The resignation will be considered by the Nominating Committee, which will make a recommendation to the board.
Board Leadership Structure, Education and Self-Assessment Process
The Company's bylaws provide for the annual election of a chairman of the board from among the directors, and the Corporate Governance Policy states it is the board's policy to separate the offices of the chairman and the chief executive officer. This separate role allows the chairman to maintain independence in the oversight of management. The chairman of the board also chairs the Executive and Governance Committee (see Executive and Governance Committee description below), which is empowered to act on behalf of the board between regular board meetings.
The board is committed to self-improvement and has established an annual self-assessment process that evaluates a different aspect of board effectiveness each year. In 2018, that process was facilitated by The Center for Board Excellence ("CBE"), an independent consultant. All directors completed an assessment of committee performance. The results of the evaluation were compiled by CBE, and a written report was given to the chairman. The chairman discussed the results with the board confidentially.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight
The board fulfills a significant role in the oversight of risk in the Company both through the actions of the board as a whole and those of its committees. The board's Risk Committee has duties and responsibilities for broad risk oversight. The Risk Committee receives regular reports on the status of the Company's enterprise risk management program, which covers the following identified categories of risk: credit, market, liquidity, operational, strategic, and reputational. The Compensation Committee reviews reports on risk to the Company associated with incentive compensation plans. The Audit Committee meets regularly with the independent registered public accounting firm to receive reports on the results of the audit and review process. In addition, the Audit Committee receives internal audit reports that enable it to monitor operational risk throughout the Company and coordinates the findings with the Risk Committee through a liaison member who serves on both committees.
Board Committees
The board of directors has the following standing committees: Audit, Executive and Governance, Nominating, Compensation, and Risk. The charter for each committee may be found on our investor relations website at www.sandyspringbank.com. Each committee's function is described as follows:
Audit Committee - The Audit Committee is appointed by the board to assist in monitoring: 1) the integrity of the financial statements and financial reporting, including the proper operation of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; 2) compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and 3) the independence and performance of internal and external auditors. The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment and oversight of the external auditor, including review of their qualifications and compensation. The Audit Committee reviews the quarterly earnings press releases, as well as the Forms 10-Q and 10-K prior to filing. All members of the committee meet all requirements and independence standards as defined in applicable law, regulations of the SEC, Nasdaq listing rules, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and related regulations. The board has determined that Pamela A. Little qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under the Nasdaq listing rules and applicable securities regulations.
Executive and Governance Committee - This committee conducts board business between regular meetings as needed and provides oversight and guidance to the board of directors to ensure that the structure, policies, and processes of the board and its committees facilitate the effective exercise of the board's role in governing the Company. The committee reviews and evaluates the policies and practices with respect to the size, composition, independence and functioning of the board and its committees as stated in the Corporate Governance Policy. This committee is also responsible for maintaining the Code of Business Conduct, the annual CEO evaluation process, and the annual board evaluation process.
Nominating Committee - Members of this committee are independent directors within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules. The Nominating Committee makes recommendations to the board with respect to nominees for election as directors. In exercising its responsibilities, the Nominating Committee considers general criteria and particular goals and needs of the Company for additional competencies or characteristics. The committee also has the authority to engage an outside search firm to source qualified candidates. See page 5 for a discussion of the nomination process.
Compensation Committee – Members of this committee are independent directors within the meaning of the Nasdaq listing rules. The Compensation Committee is responsible for developing executive compensation philosophy and determining all elements of compensation for executive officers including base salaries, short-term incentive compensation, equity awards, and retirement benefits. In addition, the committee considers other compensation and benefit plans on behalf of the board as required by regulation. The committee is charged with assessing whether the compensation plans encourage or reward unnecessary or excessive risk-taking by participants. The committee is also responsible for reviewing and making recommendations for non-employee director compensation and administering the Company's equity compensation plans.
Risk Committee – The Risk Committee is responsible for assisting the board in its oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management, including the review and approval of significant policies and practices concerning the various risks described in its charter as well as the analysis and assessment of potential risk in order to make recommendations to the board on strategic initiatives. The board delegates to the Risk Committee the oversight of specific risks as mandated by law or regulation, the authority to manage the Company's affairs with regard to risk and the authority to handle unresolved issues referred to it by the board for further deliberation and recommendation. The Risk Committee works closely with the Chief Risk Officer to monitor key risk indicators and oversee the Company's enterprise risk management structure.
Current Board Committee Membership and Number of Meetings
(1) The Audit Committee met four times in person and four times by teleconference to approve quarterly earnings releases.
(2) As chairman of the board, Mr. Orndorff is an ex officio member of all committees.
Director Attendance at Board and Committee Meetings
Each of our directors takes his and her commitment to serve on the board very seriously as demonstrated by the superior attendance record achieved each year. During 2018, the board held 9 meetings with overall attendance averaging 95%. In accordance with the Corporate Governance Policy, all incumbent directors attended well over 80% of the aggregate of (a) the total number of meetings of the board of directors and (b) the total number of meetings held by all committees on which they served.
Attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders
The board of directors believes it is important for all directors to attend the annual meeting of shareholders to show support for the Company and to provide an opportunity to interact with shareholders directly. It is our policy that directors should attend the annual meeting of shareholders unless unable to attend by reason of personal or family illness or other urgent matters. All of our directors were in attendance at the 2018 annual meeting.
Director Compensation
Cash Compensation 
Only non-employee directors are compensated for their service as board members. The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing director compensation and will periodically commission a market comparison to ensure compensation levels are appropriate and commensurate with peer companies.
In 2018, the chairman received an annual cash retainer of $52,000, and each non-employee director received an annual cash retainer of $25,000. The committee chairmen received an additional annual cash retainer as follows: Audit Committee $9,000; Compensation Committee $7,000; Executive and Governance $5,000; Nominating Committee $5,000; and Risk Committee $5,000. Board meeting attendance fees were fixed at $1,200 per board meeting and $1,000 per committee meeting.
Directors are encouraged to attend all meetings in person unless the meeting is called by teleconference. Directors who attended an in-person board meeting by phone were paid a reduced meeting fee of $500. Directors were not paid for limited-purpose teleconference meetings, and members of the Nominating Committee were not paid when the Executive & Governance Committee met on the same day. All directors of the Company also serve as directors of Sandy Spring Bank, for which they did not receive any additional compensation.
Equity Compensation
On March 28, 2018, each director received a grant of restricted stock valued at $25,000. The restricted stock will vest over three years in equal increments, and vesting is accelerated upon the permanent departure from the board other than removal for just cause.
Director Fee Deferral Plan
Directors are eligible to defer all or a portion of their fees under the Director Fee Deferral Plan. The amounts deferred accrue interest at 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate, which is not considered "above market" or preferential. Except in the case of death or financial emergency, deferred fees and accrued interest are payable only following termination of a director's service. In the event a director dies during active service, the Bank will pay benefits that exceed deferred fees and accrued interest to the extent the Bank owns an insurance policy in effect on the director's life at the time of death that pays a greater amount than the total of deferred fees and accrued interest.
Director Stock Purchase Plan
Each director has the option of using from 50% to 100% of his or her annual retainer fee to purchase newly issued shares of Company common stock at the current fair market value at the time the retainer is paid in accordance with the plan. Directors make an annual election to participate in advance, and participation in the plan is ratified by the board.
2018 Non-Employee Director Compensation
Stock Ownership Requirements for Directors 
According to the Company's bylaws, qualified directors are required to hold unencumbered shares of common stock with a fair market value of $1,000. The Corporate Governance Policy requires this minimum ownership position to increase with each year of service up to the lesser of 5,000 shares or $175,000 in fair market value by January 1st following the director's fifth anniversary of service. All of the directors exceed the requirements of the policy.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that executive officers and directors, and any persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Specific dates for such filings have been established by the SEC, and the Company is required to report in this proxy statement any failure to file reports in a timely manner in 2018. Based solely on the review of the copies of forms it has received and the written representation from each person, all the executive officers and directors have complied with filing requirements applicable to them with respect to transactions during 2018.
Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners
The following table sets forth information as of February 8, 2019, with respect to the shares of common stock beneficially owned by each director and director-nominee, by the 2018 named executive officers, and by all directors and executive officers as a group. No individual holds more than 1% of the total outstanding shares of common stock. All directors and executive officers as a group own 2.09% of outstanding common stock.

Transactions and Relationships with Management
Directors and officers of the Company obtain banking products and services from Sandy Spring Bank in the normal and ordinary course of business.

In the opinion of management, these transactions do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.
Related party transactions involving executive officers or directors, as defined in Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K, are subject to review by the board. As required by federal regulations, extensions of credit by the Bank to directors and executive officers are subject to the procedural and financial requirements of Regulation O of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which generally require advance approval of such transactions by disinterested directors. Extensions of credit to directors or officers of the Company and Bank are subject to approval by the disinterested members of the Risk Committee per the terms of Regulation O and Bank policy. If total exposure to an officer or director exceeds $500,000, extensions of credit to that officer or director are subject to approval by all disinterested directors on the board. Related party transactions as defined in Item 404 (generally, any financial transactions, arrangements, or relationships, regardless of dollar amount, other than extensions of credit and bank deposits) are subject to review by the independent directors with the affected director not present or voting.
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following compensation discussion and analysis ("CD&A") provides a detailed description of the Company's executive compensation philosophy, components, and the factors used by the Compensation Committee (or "committee" within this section) for determining 2018 compensation for the named executive officers, identified pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the compensation tables and accompanying narrative starting on page 29. For 2018, the named executive officers were:
Executive Summary
Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") is headquartered in the suburban Washington, D.C. town of Olney, Maryland. Recognizing its humble origins in 1868, the Company celebrated an impressive milestone - 150 years of business in 2018 - making it one of the oldest and largest community banks headquartered in the Baltimore/Washington metropolitan area. Overall, 2018 was a very important year for the Company in terms of growth, quality, and legacy, and we were very pleased to be noted for our consistent annual recognition as one of America's Most Trustworthy Financial Companies by Forbes.
2018 Highlights and Results
The Company grew total assets to $8.2 billion from $5.4 billion of which $2.1 billion was from the successful acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc., on January 1, 2018. In addition to the general balance sheet increases from the acquisition, the Company achieved post- acquisition total loan growth of 9% and post-acquisition total deposit growth of 6%.
Earnings increased 90% over 2017 to a record $101 million in 2018 or $2.82 per fully diluted share. Return on average assets increased to 1.27% in 2018 from 1.02% in 2017, and return on average common equity also increased to 9.84% from 9.66%. Net interest income increased by 54% over 2017 as the net interest margin increased to 3.60%.
Non-performing loans decreased to 0.55% of total loans as of December 31st, and capital levels remained strong with a total risk-based capital ratio of 12.26% at year-end.
Shareholders received $1.10 per share in dividends in 2018, an increase of 5.8%, with a dividend yield of 3.50% based on the December 31, 2018 stock price of $31.34.
2018 Executive Compensation Decisions
The Compensation Committee began its work on executive compensation for 2018 by reviewing the Company's 2017 financial performance and the goals and objectives set forth in the 2018 financial plan. In addition, the committee revised and re-stated the compensation philosophy, discussed further in the CD&A.
The committee took the following actions in 2018:
"Say On Pay" Vote and Shareholder Alignment
On April 25, 2018, shareholders voted on a non-binding resolution to approve the compensation for the named executive officers, commonly referred to as a "Say on Pay" vote. The resolution was approved with an affirmative vote of 95.6% of votes cast, which reflects a strong vote of confidence in our compensation practices.
The committee consistently utilizes the following practices to ensure that executive compensation is aligned with shareholder interests:
Executive Compensation Philosophy
The Compensation Committee of the board is committed to rewarding executive management for the Company's performance achieved through planning and execution. Therefore, the committee has developed a philosophy that identifies three guiding principles to properly structure and design elements of executive compensation. In short, executive compensation should be aligned, balanced, and rewarding.
Aligned 
Executive compensation must be aligned with the Company's strategic objectives, which state that the Company will earn independence by creating franchise and shareholder value. In order to align compensation to this strategy, a significant portion of total compensation is tied to Company performance, both absolute and relative.
Compensation must also be aligned with the competitive markets in order to attract and retain the talent, skills, and experience needed in executive management. Therefore, the committee works with an independent compensation consultant to receive periodic analyses that benchmark compensation with market trends and practices.
Finally, compensation must align the interest of executives with those of shareholders to ensure that management will be rewarded for increasing shareholder value. To accomplish this, a significant portion of total compensation is in the form of equity.
Balanced
Executive compensation must balance a number of factors. Compensation should have a proper mix of fixed and variable elements, compensation models should use multiple performance measures for balanced achievement, awards should balance short and long-term results with short and long-term career objectives, including retirement, and compensation must always balance risk with reward so as not to encourage excessive risk-taking.
Rewarding
Executive compensation must provide the means to attract, motivate, and retain the caliber of talent and leadership needed to support the Company's long record of growth and profitability. Compensation models should motivate executives to work collaboratively and creatively to generate a high-level of synergistic performance by and among the officers and employees.
To protect shareholders' interests, the Committee is also committed to ensuring that rewards are not excessive or paid to the Company's detriment. Consequently, compensation models incorporate devices such as triggers, thresholds, and maximums, and the board has adopted a "clawback" policy in the event of an accounting restatement. In addition, the committee periodically conducts a risk analysis to ensure that compensation programs do not reward excessive risk-taking.
The committee believes this philosophy will ensure the executives have a market-driven level of base compensation and benefits, with the opportunity for significant short and long-term rewards tied to performance and shareholder value. See Elements of Compensation on page 21 for information on how the committee allocates compensation to further the Company's compensation philosophy.
Factors for Determining Compensation
Goal Setting for Compensation Purposes 
On an annual basis, the board of directors approves the Company's financial plan. This plan is designed to support a multi-year strategic plan by setting annual targets for achievement that support the long-term objectives expressed in the strategic plan. Once the annual financial plan is approved by the board of directors, performance measures and targets for incentive-based compensation are derived from the plan. Mr. Schrider and Mr. Mantua report on the Company's performance to the board of directors at each regularly scheduled meeting. 
Peer Group Benchmarking
A critical element of the Company's compensation philosophy is a comparative analysis of the compensation mix and levels relative to a peer group of publicly traded, commercial banks. This analysis is a key driver of specific compensation decisions for the named executive officers and ensures proper alignment between our performance and compensation programs relative to peers, thus enabling the Company to attract and retain executive talent through competitive compensation programs.
Each year the committee reviews the peer group to determine if adjustments are necessary. For 2018, the committee selected publicly-traded commercial banks with assets between approximately $3.5 to $15.0 billion in 2017 from the Mid-Atlantic region plus Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Ohio. The median asset size of the peer group was $7.2 billion, placing the Company at the 54th percentile in pro forma asset size ($7.5 billion) in anticipation of the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares. Peer proxy data was supplemented with survey data from national banking surveys. The 2018 peer group included the following 19 banks, of which 13 were used the previous year:
Committee Discretion and Final Compensation Decisions
The committee retains the discretion to decrease all forms of incentive payouts based on significant individual or Company performance shortfalls. The committee also retains the discretion to increase awards or consider special awards for significant performance or due to subjective factors, or exclude extraordinary non-recurring results. In 2018, the committee approved adjusting certain financial plan measures to reflect the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted after the 2018 financial plan was approved.
Elements of Compensation
Base Salary
Base salary is the fundamental element of executive compensation. The committee reviews salaries in March in conjunction with annual performance appraisals for the preceding year. In determining base salaries, the committee considered the executive's qualifications and experience, scope of responsibilities, the goals and objectives established for the executive, and the executive's past performance. The committee seeks to pay a base salary commensurate with the individual's experience and performance, and relative to market. Mr. Schrider recommended base salaries for executive officers other than himself, and the committee deliberated on Mr. Schrider's salary. Due to the significant acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, effective January 1, 2018, record performance in 2017, and comparisons to peer and competitive market data, executive salaries increased accordingly. The resulting salary increases, shown below, were effective March 25, 2018.
(1) Mr. Slane was hired on May 1, 2018.
Bonuses
The committee does not generally award discretionary bonuses to management. In early 2018, the completion of the WashingtonFirst acquisition followed by the system conversion and integration work led the committee to grant modest bonuses to the executive officers, other than Mr. Schrider at his own insistence. The total approved by the committee was $100,000, and individual bonus amounts are in the Summary Compensation Table on page 29.
Short-Term Incentive Compensation
The Executive Team Incentive Plan ("ETIP") is a short-term, cash compensation plan designed to recognize and reward participants for their success in achieving specific Company goals and paid under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders. In 2018, the performance measures tied directly to the Company's 2018 financial plan and were selected for the following reasons: they contribute to the long-term viability of the Company; develop immediate and future revenue; and build the Company's general franchise value.
In 2018, the committee approved four corporate goals with the intention to reward performance based on core metrics that drive revenue and profitability. The committee believes that multiple goals provide a balanced approach and discourage excessive risk-taking by participants, all of which is consistent with our compensation philosophy.
Each corporate goal was assigned a "threshold" or minimum performance level, a "target" level of performance, and a "stretch" or maximum level at which the award opportunity was capped. For achievement of the threshold performance level, each executive participant would earn 50% of his or her respective target opportunity. Achievement of the target performance level would earn the target award, and achievement at or above the stretch performance level would earn 150% of the target opportunity. Actual results for any goal that falls between performance levels would be interpolated to calculate a proportionate award.
Target performance levels were based on an aggressive financial plan for the year that was intended to reflect high-performance among peers. Threshold performance represented a minimum level of acceptable improvement over the prior year, while the stretch performance level was set at a level that would be potentially attainable under ideal conditions. A relative weight was assigned to each goal to prioritize importance and relative contribution. The committee established a minimum performance trigger of 90% of planned net income to be achieved before any incentives could be paid.
The corporate goals selected for 2018 included a non-GAAP measure: a traditional efficiency ratio. Management believes that this measure focuses on the core operating results of the Company and provides a meaningful comparison of performance from year to year. A full discussion regarding the use of non-GAAP measures may be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The committee reviewed the results for the established goals before exercising its authority to approve the cash payments to the executives on February 13, 2019. The committee first determined that the trigger net income level was surpassed, permitting awards to be paid. The committee then reviewed the actual performance to the goals as set forth below. To calculate the payment level, the weight for each goal was multiplied by the level of achievement for that goal. The sum of all payment levels equaled 82.0273% of target.
The performance measures, respective weights, and actual performance levels for 2018 were:
The committee increased the target opportunity for each executive for the 2018 ETIP to be commensurate with the target performance levels of a high-performing bank. The target opportunity generally represented 125% of market median, as shown below. The amounts paid are listed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 29.
Long-Term, Equity-Based Compensation 
The Company's compensation philosophy identifies equity-based compensation as an effective means of aligning the interests of our shareholders, the performance of the Company, and the retention of executive management. The committee utilized performance-based and time-based restricted stock awards to accomplish these objectives.
The equity awards made in April 2018 recognized 2017 Company and individual performance. The initial target values of the awards, expressed as a percentage of base salary as of December 31, 2017, were consistent with the median benchmark data provided by Meridian. Half of the award would vest based on performance criteria, and half would vest ratably over five years on the anniversary of the grant date.
Mr. Schrider recommended, and the committee approved, an increase to the time-based half of the award by 50% for each executive in recognition of 1) the significant achievement of acquiring WashingtonFirst Bankshares, and 2) a 27% increase in operating net income at the same time in 2017, a record year. The resulting mix of time and performance-based award was 60/40 compared to 75/25 last year. The target awards are in the following chart.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive   Title   Time-based Vesting     Performance-   based  Vesting     Total   
Executive   Title   Time-based Vesting     Performance-   based  Vesting     Total   
[END TABLE]
(1) Base salary as of December 31, 2017.
Under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the number of shares constituting the restricted stock award is determined by the closing stock price on the day before the grant date. The actual number of shares was rounded to the nearest whole share. The award values are in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on page 31.
The performance-based awards are tied to two measures: 50% of the award will vest based upon the achievement of three-year total shareholder return ("TSR") compared to an index of publicly-traded U.S. banks between 50% and 200% of the Company's asset size; the remaining 50% will vest based upon the achievement of cumulative earnings per share over three years, adjusted for certain one-time or extraordinary events such as future M&A activity. The performance period is January 1, 2018 – December 31, 2020. The measures are shown below with the related threshold, target, and stretch values; and actual performance will be interpolated to calculate a proportionate award. 
Both the time-based and performance-based restricted stock will vest immediately upon the death or disability of the executive. The time-based awards will fully vest, and the performance-based awards will vest at the target level adjusted proportionately for the number of days elapsed in the performance period. 
Upon a change in control, neither the time-based nor performance-based restricted stock is subject to accelerated vesting nor cash settlement except to the extent that the definitive agreement for the change in control provides for such accelerated vesting or cash settlement. Performance criteria will be deemed to be satisfied at the target level and awards will vest solely by reference to the executive's continued employment. If, however, within twelve months after the change in control, the executive's employment terminates, other than for just cause, the award will fully vest. Additional detail is provided in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on page 31.
Named Executive Officer New Hire Compensation
In March 2018, the committee approved new hire cash bonus payments and equity grants for Kevin Slane, the Company's new Executive Vice President and Chief Risk Officer. In addition to a base salary and participation in executive compensation plans for 2018, Mr. Slane received a sign-on bonus of $150,000, paid in three installments of $50,000 each in May, August, and December 2018. Each installment was subject to full reimbursement if Mr. Slane voluntarily resigned within a year of a payment. In addition, Mr. Slane received a time-based restricted stock award valued at $260,000 to vest ratably over three years, a performance-based restricted stock award valued at $100,000 to vest as on the same terms as other PRSAs granted in 2018, and reimbursement for relocation expenses of up to $100,000.
Deferred Compensation and Retirement Benefits
Executive Incentive Retirement Plan
All executives participate in a nonqualified, deferred compensation plan known as the Executive Incentive Retirement Plan ("EIRP"). Unlike most executive supplemental retirement plans, the EIRP provides contributions in consideration of the Company's performance each year. Executives receive a minimum cash contribution of 3% of base salary with the opportunity for increased contributions based on identified performance criteria. For 2018, the committee established the attainment of return on average assets ("ROAA") compared to the median of a regional group of peer banks. The peer group used was the same peer group described on page 20, with performance updated at the end of the performance period on December 31, 2018. The 2018 schedule for deferral contributions was approved as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Return on Average  Assets Percentile       Versus Peer Group   Deferral Contribution for       Executive Officers% of Base Salary     Deferral                                           Contribution for President                                           & CEO%                                           of Base Salary

[END TABLE]
In 2018, ROAA for the Company was 1.27%. Compared to the peer group median of 1.25%, the Company achieved 102% of the peer group's result, yielding a deferral contribution of 9.375% for Mr. Schrider and 7.50% for the other executive officers. The amounts of the 2018 deferral contributions are shown in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans section beginning on page 33 along with a description of the terms and conditions for balances paid under the EIRP. The 2018 deferral contributions are also included in the Summary of Compensation table on page 29, and potential awards are further described in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table on page 31.
401(k) Plan
The named executive officers are eligible to participate in benefit plans available to all employees, including the Sandy Spring Bank 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan provides a 100% match on the first 4% of salary deferred and a 50% match on the next 2% of salary deferred, up to the maximum allowed by the IRS regulations.
Pension Plan
The Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. Retirement Income Plan ("Pension Plan") was generally available to employees through December 31, 2007, at which time the Pension Plan was frozen. Of the named executive officers, Messrs. Schrider, Mantua, and Caceres are participants. The accumulated benefit for each may be found in the Pension Benefits table on page 32.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
Executives and other officers who are eligible may participate in the Sandy Spring Bank Deferred Compensation Plan as described on page 33. Currently, only Mr. O'Brien participates in this plan.
Business-Related Benefits and Perquisites
The committee believes that perquisites should be limited in scope and have a business-related purpose. The committee periodically reviews perquisites to ensure alignment with the desired philosophy. The committee approves specific perquisites or benefits for individuals based on the needs of the position. 
In 2018, perquisites for all of the named executive officers included eligibility for a company-paid, supplemental long-term disability insurance policy and a long-term care insurance policy, and a comprehensive executive health screening the values for which, if applicable, are represented under "All Other Compensation" in the Summary of Compensation table on page 29.
In addition, Mr. Schrider receives the use of a company-owned vehicle. Mr. Caceres and Mr. O'Brien each receive a car allowance of $1,000 per month. Mr. O'Brien maintains a membership, at company expense, at a country club in Northern Virginia for business development purposes. Mr. O'Brien reimburses the Company for personal use of the membership. Mr. Schrider, Mr. Mantua, and Mr. Caceres have access to a corporate membership at a local country club for business purposes.
Role of the Compensation Committee, Management and Compensation Consultants in the Executive Compensation Process
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee is made up of independent directors as required under the Nasdaq listing rules. Details on the committee's functions are described in the committee's charter, which has been approved by the board of directors and is available on our Investor Relations website.
The committee has the authority to obtain advice and assistance from internal or external legal, human resources, accounting or other experts, advisors, or consultants as it deems desirable or appropriate. The committee has sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultant and to approve the fee and the terms of engagement. For 2018, the committee engaged an independent consulting firm specializing in executive compensation.
In 2018, the committee reviewed and approved all aspects of compensation plans and policies applicable to the named executive officers, including participation and performance measures. In carrying out its duties, the committee considered the relationship of corporate performance to total compensation; set salary and bonus levels and equity-based awards for executive officers; and reviewed the adequacy and effectiveness of various compensation and benefit plans. The chairman of the committee reported committee actions to the board of directors following each committee meeting.
The committee worked closely with Mr. Schrider to review and discuss his recommendations for the other executive officers. The committee also considered the market analysis provided by the compensation consultant to assess market practices, the mix of fixed and variable compensation, and the levels of compensation for each executive.
The CEO performance evaluation for 2018 was coordinated by Center for Board Excellence and involved receiving feedback from each director separately and anonymously for compilation. The Executive and Governance Committee reviewed the compiled evaluation and provided feedback to Mr. Schrider. The Compensation Committee used this evaluation in compensation decisions concerning Mr. Schrider.
Role of Management
In 2018, Mr. Schrider and the executive officers, as customary, were responsible for the development of the annual business and financial plans as well as a long-term strategic plan, which were reviewed and approved by the board of directors. The financial plan provided the foundation for setting the performance goals and targets to be achieved during the fiscal year that were included in incentive compensation plans.
Messrs. Schrider, Mantua, and General Counsel and Secretary Ronald E. Kuykendall, as well as other members of management attended portions of the Compensation Committee meetings where company performance, market considerations, and legal analyses were discussed. However, management was not present during final deliberations on executive compensation, and only committee members voted on executive compensation matters.
In addition, Mr. Schrider engaged a separate compensation consultant to gather feedback from the executives regarding executive compensation plans and general compensation levels. The consultant presented the results of the study to the Compensation Committee at a regular meeting. Utilizing the analysis provided by the independent compensation consultant and the feedback gathered by the consultant he engaged, at the direction of the committee, Mr. Schrider developed recommendations for executive compensation other than his own.
Role of Independent Compensation Consultant 
The committee engages an independent executive compensation consultant to provide commentary, analysis and expertise relating to executive compensation. For 2018 compensation decisions, the committee engaged Meridian. The committee reviewed the Nasdaq independence standards and determined Meridian to be independent with no identified conflicts of interest. The committee had direct access to the consultant and control over the engagement at all times. 
The committee considered a market analysis compiled by Meridian when deliberating compensation decisions for 2018. This analysis included, but was not limited to, an assessment of the Company's compensation programs compared to its peers, recommendations for total direct compensation and target direct compensation as well as long-term incentive compensation and supplemental executive retirement benefits. The analysis provided the committee with a broad array of information with which to assess the Company's compensation program, and it served as a foundation for compensation decisions. In 2018, the committee requested and received recommendations from Meridian concerning Mr. Schrider's compensation in view of the growth of the Company following the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc.
Additional Compensation Policies, Practices and Considerations
Stock Ownership Requirements for Executives
The board believes that the Company's executive officers should accumulate meaningful equity stakes in the Company in order to further align their economic interests with those of shareholders. Our stock ownership guidelines require the CEO to own shares valued at three times his or her base salary, and other executive officers are required to own shares valued at one times his or her base salary. The officer has five years from the date of hire or promotion to be compliant with these guidelines. All of the named executive officers, with the exception of Mr. Slane who was hired May 1, 2018, own Company common stock in excess of this requirement.
Clawback Policy
In 2012, the board approved a Policy for the Recovery of Performance Compensation, also known as a "clawback" policy. The policy states that in the event the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance by the Company with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Company, at the direction and sole discretion of the Compensation Committee and the board of directors, will recover from any current or former executive officer of the Company who received incentive-based compensation during the three years preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare the accounting restatement, based on the erroneous data, in excess of what would have been paid to the executive officer under the accounting restatement.
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
The committee, in consultation with management, periodically assesses the Company's compensation policies and practices and considers whether our executive compensation program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk taking. The committee also reviews with management the various executive, non-executive, and functional incentive plans operated by the Company. Our executives receive a significant proportion of compensation in the form of equity awards that have performance and vesting features that extend over several years, as well as being subject to stock ownership requirements. This ensures that our executives have significant value tied to long-term stock price performance, which discourages imprudent risk-taking. Additionally, PRSAs are based on our performance over a three-year period, encouraging our executive officers to focus on long-term performance in addition to annual results.
Impact of Accounting and Taxation on the Form of Compensation
The committee and the Company consider the accounting and tax (individual and corporate) consequences of the compensation plans prior to making any changes to the plans. For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally eliminated the "performance-based" compensation exception under 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and expanded the $1 million per covered employee annual limitation on deductibility to a larger group of named executive officers. In addition, the new tax law also provides that any named executive officer who was a covered employee in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2017, will continue to be a covered employee for all subsequent taxable years. As a result, the Company may no longer take an annual deduction for any compensation paid to its expanded number of covered employees in excess of $1 million per covered employee unless "performance-based" compensation is paid pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017, and that was not modified in any material respect on or after such date.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on this review and discussion, the committee recommends to the board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.
Executive Compensation Tables
Summary Compensation Table
(5) This column consists of other compensation, perquisites and personal benefits for the named executive officers, including as applicable: supplemental long-term care and disability insurance, executive health screening, and life insurance premiums.

Messrs. O'Brien and Caceres each received $12,000 in car allowance. Mr. Slane received $7,715 in 401(k) matching funds while each of the other executives received $11,800.
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End
The following table shows information regarding all unvested equity awards held by the named executive officers at December 31, 2018. These awards are subject to forfeiture until vested, and the ultimate value of performance-based awards is unknown.
(7) Shares granted on April 25, 2018 will vest ratably on the anniversary of the grant through April 25, 2023.
(10) These shares granted May 1, 2018 will vest ratably on the anniversary of the grant through May 1, 2021.
Grants of Plan-Based Awards
The following table sets forth information on plan-based awards made to the named executive officers in 2018. These include time-based restricted stock awards ("RSA"), performance-based restricted stock awards that vest based on 3-year total shareholder return compared to peers ("PRSA-T"), performance-based restricted stock awards that vest based on 3-year cumulative earnings per share ("PRSA-E"), cash awards under the Executive Team Incentive Plan ("ETIP"), and deferred cash awards under the Executive Incentive Retirement Plan ("EIRP").
Option Exercises and Stock Vested
The following table shows the value realized upon the vesting of restricted stock awards in 2018.
Pension Benefits
The following table shows the present value of the accumulated benefit under the Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. Retirement Income Plan ("Pension Plan") for those named executive officers who participate in the Pension Plan.
Benefits under the Pension Plan are provided on a 10-year certain and life basis and are not subject to deduction for Social Security or other offset amounts. When the Pension Plan was active, earnings covered were total wages, including elective pre-tax contributions under the 401(k) Plan, bonuses, and other cash compensation up to the allowable limit under the Internal Revenue Code.
The Pension Plan benefit equals the sum of three parts: (a) the benefit accrued as of December 31, 2000, based on the formula of 1.5% of highest five-year average salary as of that date times years of service as of that date, plus (b) 1.75% of each year's earnings after December 31, 2000 (1.75% of career average earnings) through December 31, 2005, and (c) 1.0% of each year's earnings thereafter, through December 31, 2007. The Pension Plan permits early retirement at age 55 after 10 years of service completed after December 31, 2000.
Pay Ratio
The Company is required by SEC rules to disclose the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (excluding the Chief Executive Officer), the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, and the ratio of these two amounts (the "pay ratio"). The pay ratio below is a reasonable estimate based on the Company's payroll records and the methodology described below, and was calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. Because SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to use variety of methodologies, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
The Company selected November 3, 2018 as the determination date for identifying the median employee. Year-to-date taxable wages paid from January 1, 2018 to November 3, 2018 for all employees as of the determination date, with the exception of Mr. Schrider, were arrayed from lowest to highest. Wages of newly hired permanent employees were adjusted to represent wages for the entire measurement period. This period captured all incentive payments for the tax year as well as the vesting of equity awards, as applicable. The median employee was identified, and total compensation for the median employee was calculated in the manner required for the Summary Compensation Table. Mr. Schrider's total compensation for 2018, as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table, was $1,754,015 and the median employee's was $100,926, producing a ratio of 17 to 1.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans
Executive Incentive Retirement Plan
All of the named executive officers participate in the Executive Incentive Retirement Plan ("EIRP"), a deferred compensation plan that replaced supplemental executive retirement agreements ("SERAs") with the named executive officers. Prior balances carried over from the SERAs vest over 15 years and automatically vest upon the executive's death or disability or upon a change in control. Deferral contributions and earnings paid under the EIRP vest immediately. Earnings on EIRP balances accrue at an interest rate equal to 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate, adjusted monthly.
The executive's account balance (including vested balances accrued under the former SERAs) will be distributed to the executive per the terms of the EIRP following termination of employment either in a lump sum or in installments, at the election of the executive. No payments will be made to an executive who is terminated for just cause as defined in the plan. The EIRP provides a minimum, annual contribution of 3% of base salary. Each year, the Compensation Committee determines the performance criteria by which a deferral bonus over the minimum may be earned as described under Deferred Compensation and Retirement Benefits on page 24.
Sandy Spring Bank Deferred Compensation Plan
Under the terms of Sandy Spring Bank Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may defer up to 25% of base salary and/or commissions earned during the year and up to 100% of bonus compensation. Interest accrues on the account balance at a rate equal to 120% of the long-term Applicable Federal Rate, adjusted monthly. The participant will receive the account balance following the six-month anniversary of any separation from service.
The following table summarizes the contributions, earnings and balances for the named executive officers under the EIRP, and earnings from the Sandy Spring Bank Deferred Compensation Plan.

Agreements with Executives and Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
Daniel J. Schrider
The Company and the Bank have an employment agreement with Mr. Schrider to provide for his employment as President and CEO. The initial term of the agreement was for three years and provides that the board of directors may take action to extend the term for an additional year at each anniversary so that the remaining term again becomes three years. Mr. Schrider's agreement does not automatically renew. The Executive and Governance Committee reviews CEO performance annually and recommends whether or not to extend the CEO's employment agreement. Mr. Schrider's employment agreement currently has a term expiring on July 1, 2021. The agreement addresses such matters as Mr. Schrider's base salary, participation in incentive compensation, participation in benefit plans, vacation, insurance and other fringe benefits.
There is no specific compensation provision under Mr. Schrider's agreement for termination due to retirement, death, or voluntary resignation. Should Mr. Schrider become disabled, the board must provide written notice 30 days in advance of termination. Mr. Schrider will receive his full base salary, benefits, and any perquisites other than bonus during the time of incapacity leading up to the date of termination less any benefits paid under existing disability plans. For termination by Mr. Schrider with good reason or involuntary termination by the Company or Bank without just cause, Mr. Schrider will receive his base salary and medical benefits for the remainder of the term of the agreement.
In the event of a change in control during the term of the agreement, and, thereafter, if Mr. Schrider's employment is terminated without just cause or he terminates his employment with good reason, as defined in the agreement, he will receive a lump-sum payment equal to three times his average annual compensation for the past five years preceding the change in control and medical benefits for the remaining term of the agreement.
Mr. Schrider's agreement does not entitle him to receive any tax indemnification payments (a "gross-up") if payments under his employment agreement or any other payments trigger liability under Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code for an excise tax on "excess parachute payments." If any payments to Mr. Schrider trigger such excise tax, he will be entitled to receive the greater of the following, whichever gives him the highest net after-tax amount: (a) the full payments and benefits provided for under the agreement, in which case he would be responsible for any resulting excise tax, or (b) one dollar less than the amount that would subject him to the excise tax.
Under the terms of his agreement, Mr. Schrider is prohibited from conflicts of interest, and is required to maintain the confidentiality of nonpublic information regarding the Company and its clients. He is also bound by a covenant not to compete for one year and not to solicit employees for two years following termination of employment, except in the event of a change in control.
Philip J. Mantua, Joseph J. O'Brien, Jr., and Kevin Slane
The Company and the Bank entered into an employment agreements with Mr. Mantua and Mr. O'Brien on January 13, 2012, and with Mr. Slane on March 29, 2018 to provide for each executive's employment in their respective positions. The form of agreement ("the Agreement") is the same for each executive. The terms of the present agreements end on June 30, 2020. Each July 1, the board of directors may take action to extend the term for an additional year so that the remaining term becomes two years. The Agreement does not automatically renew. The Agreement addresses such matters as base salary, participation in incentive compensation, participation in benefit plans, vacation, insurance and other fringe benefits.
The Agreement does not provide for any special or additional compensation in the event of termination due to retirement, death or resignation. For termination due to disability, the executive will receive base compensation, less any applicable disability benefits, and health and welfare benefits for the remaining term of the Agreement. For termination by the Company without just cause, or termination by the executive with good reason, as defined in the agreement, the executive will receive his base salary for the remaining term of the agreement at the highest annual rate paid in the 12 months preceding the termination plus annual cash bonuses (pro-rated for a partial year) as a lump sum payment.
If, in connection with a change in control, as defined by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the executive's employment is terminated, either involuntarily without just cause or voluntarily with good reason, within six months prior to the change in control or up to two years after the change in control, the executive will receive a lump-sum payment equal to 2.99 times the sum of annual salary at the highest rate paid in the preceding 12 months plus the amount of any other compensation received for the past 12 months. The executive would also receive the continuation of health benefits including life and disability insurances for a period of three years following termination. If the total value of the benefits provided and payments made to the executive in connection with a change in control, either under the Agreement alone or together with other payments and benefits received, would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the severance payment will be reduced or revised so that the aggregate payments do not trigger the payment of the excise tax.
The executive is prohibited from conflicts of interest, and is required to maintain the confidentiality of nonpublic information regarding the Company and its clients. The executive is also bound by a covenant not to compete and not to interfere with other employees following termination of employment for the remaining term of the agreement. The post-termination restrictions do not apply if there is a change in control or if the executive's employment is terminated without just cause by the Company or with good reason by the executive.
R. Louis Caceres 
Mr. Caceres has a change in control severance agreement with the Company and the Bank. The change in control agreement has a term of two years, also known as the "Covered Period." On each anniversary date of the agreement, the agreement will automatically be extended for an additional year, unless either party has given written notice at least 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the agreement that the agreement will not be extended.
If a change in control occurs and the executive's employment is involuntarily terminated without just cause or the executive voluntarily terminates employment with good reason, as defined in the agreement, during the Covered Period, the executive will be entitled to a payment equal to 2.99 times his total compensation, which is defined as one year's base salary plus bonus payments and all other taxable compensation. The executive would also receive the continuation of health benefits, including life and disability insurances, for a period of three years following termination. Under the change in control agreements, if the total value of the benefits provided and payments made to the executive in connection with a change in control, either under the change in control agreement alone or together with other payments and benefits that he has the right to receive, would result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, his severance payment will be reduced or revised so that the aggregate payments do not trigger the payment of the excise tax.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The following table summarizes the estimated payments to which the named executive officers were entitled upon termination as of December 31, 2018. Benefits payable under the Pension Plan, the 401(k) Plan, bank-owned life insurance, and vested balances under non-qualified, deferred compensation plans are not included.
PROPOSAL 2: A Non-Binding Resolution to Approve the Compensation for the Named Executive Officers 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act requires companies to submit to shareholders a non-binding vote on the compensation of the named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation, and the accompanying narrative disclosure in this proxy statement. The board recommended and the shareholders elected to have this proposal submitted annually.
This proposal, commonly known as a "Say on Pay" proposal, gives our shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the executive compensation program and policies through the following resolution:
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and related material in this proxy statement." 
This vote will not be binding on the board of directors and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the board nor to create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by the board. However, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
The board of directors believes that the compensation practices of the Company are designed to accomplish the objectives described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and that they are appropriately aligned with the long-term success of the Company and the interests of shareholders.
Voting Standard
This matter will be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting. On this matter, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting. Accordingly, it is particularly important that beneficial owners of our stock instruct their brokers or nominees how to vote their shares.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
PROPOSAL 3: The Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Year 2019
The Audit Committee ("the committee" in this section) has engaged Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019. In accordance with established policy, the board is submitting this proposal to the vote of the shareholders for ratification. In the event the appointment is not ratified by a majority of the shareholders it is anticipated that no change in auditors will be made for the current year because of the difficulty and expense of making a change so long after the beginning of the year, but the vote will be considered in connection with the auditor appointment for 2020.
In reaching its decision to engage Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee considered the independence factors, the length of the audit firm's tenure as the Company's independent auditor, the audit firm's past performance, the audit firm's relationship with the Committee and with management, and the fee structure that was negotiated. After discussion of these factors, the Committee concluded that it was in the best interests of shareholders to continue the engagement of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
Ernst & Young provides tax compliance services for trust clients of Sandy Spring Bank, the fees for which are billed to those clients. These services, which are permissible under applicable SEC and PCAOB independence standards, were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. In 2017, Ernst & Young was also engaged to provide tax compliance services related to the preparation of federal and state income tax returns. In 2018, management selected another provider for these tax compliance services. The fees paid for these services are disclosed below.
Representatives of Ernst & Young will be present and available at the annual meeting to respond to appropriate questions.
Voting Standard
In voting to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, shareholders may vote for the proposal, against the proposal or abstain from voting. This matter will be decided by the majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting. On this matter, abstentions will have no effect on the voting.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2018.
Audit and Non-Audit Fees
The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered for the audit of the annual financial statements of the Company and subsidiaries by Ernst & Young for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018, together with fees billed for other services.
Audit Committee's Preapproval Policies and Procedures for Audit and Non-Audit Services
The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young. An exception for preapproval of non-audit services may be made if:
All audit services, tax services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by Ernst & Young have been preapproved by the Audit Committee as required by SEC regulations and the Audit Committee's charter without exception. The Committee also has determined the amount and nature of non-audit services rendered by Ernst & Young to the Company is consistent with its independence.
Report of the Audit Committee
The Company's management is responsible for its internal controls and financial reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Stated and expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

All members of the committee are independent and financially literate as defined in applicable law, regulations of the SEC, Nasdaq listing rules, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and related regulations.

Among these duties, the Committee:
Based upon the review, discussion, disclosures, and materials described above, the Committee recommends to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Upon receipt of the Notice, shareholders may choose to request a printed copy of proxy materials at no charge, and this preference will be maintained for future mailings.
