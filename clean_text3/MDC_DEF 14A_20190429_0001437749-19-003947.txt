AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO SOUND GOVERNANCE, A SKILLED AND DIVERSE BOARD, AND SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES
We take pride in our achievements which we attribute, in no small measure, to devoted employees and a dedicated operating strategy that emphasizes financial stability in the pursuit of value-creation. We have been fortunate to expand our Board with Leslie Fox, an independent outside director with decades of real estate experience. She is the second female director to join our board in the past two years. We also are marking the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the MDC/Richmond American Homes Foundation, which continues to support corporate citizenship, philanthropy, and sustainability in the communities we are privileged to serve.

PROXY STATEMENT
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS
April 29, 2019
___________
GENERAL INFORMATION
Why am I receiving these materials?
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") of M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company (the "Meeting") to be held at our principal executive offices, 4350 South Monaco Street, 6th Floor, Assembly Room, Denver, Colorado 80237, on Monday, April 29, 2019, at 12:00 Noon, Mountain Time, and any postponements or adjournments thereof. The record date for determining shareholders entitled to vote at the Meeting is March 1, 2019 (the "Record Date"). The Meeting is being held for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Our shareholders are invited to attend the Meeting and are encouraged to vote on the matters described in this Proxy Statement.
What proxy materials are being delivered?
We are utilizing the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") that allow us to deliver proxy materials to our shareholders on the Internet. Under these rules, we are sending most of our shareholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") instead of a full set of proxy materials. If you receive the Notice, you will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless you specifically request them. Instead, the Notice tells you how to access and review on the Internet all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice also tells you how to vote your proxy card on the Internet and how to request a printed copy of our proxy materials. We expect to mail, or provide the Notice and electronic delivery of, this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and the Notice of Annual Meeting (the "Proxy Materials") on or about March 8, 2019.
The Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes the Company's 2018 audited financial statements, will accompany these Proxy Materials. Except to the extent expressly referenced in this Proxy Statement, the Annual Report is not incorporated into this Proxy Statement.
Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?
The Company will pay the cost of solicitation. The Company also will reimburse bankers, brokers and others holding shares in their names or in the names of nominees or otherwise for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in sending the Proxy Materials to the beneficial owners of such shares. In addition to the original solicitation of proxies, solicitations may be made in person, by telephone or by other means of communication by Directors, officers and employees of the Company, who will not be paid any additional compensation for these activities.
We have retained the services of Alliance Advisors, LLC to solicit proxies. We will pay all reasonable costs associated with such firm, which we anticipate will cost approximately $13,000 plus costs and expenses.
Who is entitled to vote at or attend the Annual Meeting?
Holders of shares of the Company's common stock, $.01 par value, at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. All shareholders of record and beneficial owners wishing to attend the Meeting must bring with them a government issued picture identification of themselves and check in at the registration desk at the Meeting. Beneficial owners must also bring proof of ownership as described below. Attendees must comply with the rules of conduct available at the registration desk. A list of shareholders of record entitled to vote at the Meeting will be available for examination by any shareholder at the Meeting and for ten days prior to the Meeting at our principal executive offices.
Shareholders will have sufficient time immediately following the Meeting to ask questions of and have a dialogue with the Company's Chairman and CEO, President and COO, CFO and each of the members of the Board of Directors in attendance.
Shareholders of Record. If, on the Record Date, your shares were registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, then you are a shareholder of record. As a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Meeting or vote by proxy.
Beneficial Owners. If, on the Record Date, your shares were not held in your name, but rather were held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee (commonly referred to as being held in "street name"), or through our 401(k) savings plan, you are the beneficial owner of those shares. The organization holding your account is considered to be the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other nominee regarding how to vote the shares held in your account. You are also invited to attend the Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Meeting unless you obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker or other nominee and bring the legal proxy to the Meeting. (Legal proxies are not available for shares held through our 401(k) savings plan; you must vote those shares as provided below.) If you want to attend the Meeting, but not vote at the Meeting, you must provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the Record Date, such as your most recent account statement prior to the Record Date.
How do I vote my shares? 
By Telephone or the Internet. Shareholders can vote their shares via telephone or the Internet as instructed in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. The telephone and Internet procedures are designed to authenticate a shareholder's identity, allow shareholders to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. The telephone and Internet voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 28, 2019. (Participants in our 401(k) savings plan have an earlier deadline – see below.)
By Mail. Shareholders who receive a paper proxy card may vote by mail and should complete, sign and date their proxy card and mail it in the pre-addressed envelope that accompanied the delivery of the paper proxy card. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by the time of the Meeting in order for your shares to be voted. Beneficial shareholders (shares held in street name) may vote by mail by requesting a paper proxy card according to the instructions received from their broker or other agent, and then completing, signing and dating the voting instruction card provided by the broker or other agent and mailing it in the pre-addressed envelope provided.
401(k) Savings Plan. If your shares are held through our 401(k) savings plan, you will receive the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, or copies of the Proxy Materials, and you are entitled to instruct the plan trustee how to vote the shares allocated to your account following the instructions described above. You must provide your instructions no later than 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 24, 2019.
At the Meeting.   Shares held in your name as the shareholder of record may be voted by you in person at the Meeting. Shares held beneficially in street name may be voted by you in person at the Meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker or other agent that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote the shares, and you bring the legal proxy to the Meeting.
What if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials?
If you receive more than one Notice, you hold shares in more than one name or shares in different accounts. To ensure that all of your shares are voted, you will need to vote separately by telephone or the Internet using the specific control number contained in each Notice that you receive.
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy?
You can change your vote or revoke your proxy before the Meeting. You can do this by casting a later proxy through any of the available methods described above. If you are a shareholder of record, you can also revoke your proxy by delivering written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company, by presenting to the Company a later-dated proxy card executed by the person executing the prior proxy card or by attending the Meeting and voting in person. If you are a beneficial owner, you can revoke your proxy by following the instructions sent to you by your broker, bank or other agent.
How are votes counted?
Shares of common stock represented by properly executed proxy cards, or voted by proxy, by telephone or the Internet, and received in time for the Meeting will be voted in accordance with the instructions specified in the proxies. Unless contrary instructions are indicated in a proxy, the shares of common stock represented by such proxy will be voted FOR the election as Directors of the nominees named in this Proxy Statement and FOR all of the other proposals. If you grant a proxy (other than for shares held in our 401(k) savings plan), either of the officers named as proxy holders, Michael Touff and Joseph H. Fretz, or their nominees or substitutes, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters that are properly presented for a vote at the Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement that may take place. If, for any unforeseen reason, any of our nominees is not available as a candidate for Director, the persons named as the proxy holder may vote your proxy for another candidate or other candidates nominated by our Board.
The trustee of the 401(k) savings plan will vote the number of shares of common stock allocated to each participant's accounts as directed by the participant if the direction is received in time to be processed. The trustee will vote any shares with respect to which it does not receive timely directions so that the proportion of the shares voted in any particular manner on any matter is the same as the proportion of the shares with respect to which the trustee has received timely directions, unless contrary to ERISA.
The inspector of elections designated by the Company will use procedures consistent with Delaware law concerning the voting of shares, the determination of the presence of a quorum and the determination of the outcome of each matter submitted for a vote.
What are the voting entitlements and requirements?
Each share of common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date, other than shares held by the Company or a subsidiary, is entitled to one vote on each matter presented at the Meeting. As of the Record Date, approximately 61,338,701 shares of common stock were issued, outstanding and entitled to vote.
The Company's By-Laws provide that the holders of one-third of the shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, constitute a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting. Shareholders who are present in person or represented by proxy, whether they vote for, against or abstain from voting on any matter, will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes, described below, also will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists.
The affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting will be required for the election of a nominee to the Board of Directors (which means that the four nominees who receive the most votes will be elected).
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock represented and entitled to vote at the Meeting is necessary to (1) approve, on an advisory basis, the executive compensation practices disclosed in this proxy statement; (2) approve the amendment to the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan; and (3) ratify the appointment of the Company's auditor. Because your vote on executive compensation is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company.
Rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") determine whether NYSE member organizations ("brokers") holding shares for an owner in street name may vote on a proposal without specific voting instructions from the owner. For certain types of proposals, the NYSE has ruled that the "broker may vote" without specific instructions and on other types of proposals the "broker may not vote" without specific client instructions. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a proxy is received from a broker and the broker has not voted with respect to a particular proposal. The proposal to ratify the selection of the auditor is a "broker may vote" matter under the rules of the NYSE. As a result, brokers holding shares for an owner in street name may vote on the proposal even if no voting instructions are provided by the beneficial owner. The other proposals are "broker may not vote" matters. As a result, brokers holding shares for an owner in street name may vote on these proposals only if voting instructions are provided by the beneficial owner.
The following table reflects the vote required for the proposals and the effect of broker non-votes, withhold votes and abstentions on the vote, assuming a quorum is present at the Meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
           Effect of Broker Non-Votes,  
   Proposal      Vote Required     Withhold Votes and Abstentions   
1.  Election of Directors     The four nominees who receive the most votes will be elected.     Broker non-votes and withhold votes have no effect.  
2.  Advisory vote to approve executive compensation (Say on Pay)     Affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented and entitled to vote at the Meeting.     Broker non-votes have no effect; abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the proposal.  
3.  Approval of an amendment to the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan     Affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented and entitled to vote at the Meeting.     Broker non-votes have no effect; abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the proposal.  
4.  Selection of Auditor     Affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock represented and entitled to vote at the Meeting.     Broker non-votes have no effect; abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
Management and the Board of Directors of the Company know of no other matters to be brought before the Meeting. If any other proposals are properly presented to the shareholders at the Meeting, the number of votes required for approval will depend on the nature of the proposal. Generally, under Delaware law and our By-Laws, the number of votes required to approve a proposal is the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Meeting. The proxy card gives discretionary authority to the proxy holders to vote on any matter not included in this Proxy Statement that is properly presented to the shareholders at the Meeting and any adjournments or postponements thereof. The persons named as proxies on the proxy card are Michael Touff, the Company's Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and Joseph H. Fretz, the Company's Secretary and Corporate Counsel.
DELIVERY OF PROXY MATERIALS TO SHAREHOLDERS WITH SHARED ADDRESSES 
The broker, bank or other nominee of any shareholder who is a beneficial owner, but not the record holder, of the Company's common stock may deliver only one copy of the proxy related materials to multiple shareholders sharing an address (a practice called "householding"), unless the broker, bank or nominee has received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders.
In addition, with respect to shareholders of record, in some cases, only one copy of the proxy related materials may be delivered to multiple shareholders sharing an address, unless the Company has received contrary instructions from one or more of the shareholders. Upon written or oral request, the Company will deliver free of charge a separate copy of each of the proxy related materials, as applicable, to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy was delivered. You can notify your broker, bank or other nominee (if you are not the record holder) or the Company (if you are the record holder) that you wish to receive a separate copy of such materials in the future, or alternatively, that you wish to receive a single copy of the materials instead of multiple copies. The Company's contact information for these purposes is: M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., telephone number: (303) 773-1100, Attn: Corporate Secretary, 4350 South Monaco Street, Suite 500, Denver, CO 80237.
ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K
The Company will provide without charge to each person solicited by this Proxy Statement, upon the request of that person, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K (without exhibits) for our most recent fiscal year. Please direct that request in writing to Investor Relations, M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., 4350 S. Monaco Street, Denver, Colorado 80237.

 PROPOSAL ONE   ELECTION OF DIRECTORS    
[END TABLE]
The Company's Certificate of Incorporation provides for three classes of directors ("Directors") with staggered terms of office, to be divided as equally as possible. Directors of each class serve for terms of three years until election and qualification of their successors or until their resignation, death, disqualification or removal from office.
Our Board has ten members, consisting of four Class I Directors whose terms expire in 2019, three Class II Directors whose terms expire in 2020 and three Class III Directors whose terms expire in 2021. At the Meeting, four Class I Directors are to be elected to three-year terms expiring in 2022. The nominees for the Class I Directors are Michael A. Berman, Herbert T. Buchwald, Larry A. Mizel and Leslie B. Fox. All of the nominees presently serve on the Board of Directors of the Company. Ms. Fox was appointed to the Board in June 2018 following a review of potential non-management candidates by current non-management directors and the recommendation of the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee. Based on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, the Board approved the nomination of Messrs. Berman, Buchwald and Mizel and Ms. Fox for election as Class I Directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Certain information, as of March 1, 2019, the Record Date, with respect to Messrs. Berman, Buchwald and Mizel and Ms. Fox, the nominees for election, and the continuing Directors of the Company, furnished in part by each such person, appears below:

Board Composition.
The Company's Board is composed of Directors who provide diverse experience and talent to our Company. Four of our ten Directors have Board tenure of seven years or less, with two of these Directors serving as chairs of key Board Committees. New Directors bring a fresh perspective to our Board's deliberations. The remaining Directors continue to provide their knowledge, experience and understanding of the Company's approach to balancing risk and reward inherent in the homebuilding industry, which is fundamental to achieving long-term shareholder value. The professional qualifications of the Directors include a diverse range of talents and experiences well suited to guiding the Company in our challenging industry.

Director Independence.
Each of Ms. Fox and Messrs. Raymond T. Baker, Michael A. Berman, David E. Blackford, Herbert T. Buchwald, Paris G. Reece III and David Siegel are independent. NYSE listing standards require that the Board be comprised of a majority of independent directors. SEC rules and NYSE listing standards require that audit committees be comprised solely of independent directors. NYSE listing standards also require that corporate governance/nominating committees and compensation committees be comprised solely of independent directors.
Under the NYSE listing standards, no director qualifies as "independent" unless the Board of Directors affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the Company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. Material relationships can include commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable and familial relationships, among others. The NYSE listing standards also require that, in determining the independence of any director who will serve on the Company's Compensation Committee, the Board of Directors consider all factors specifically relevant to determining whether the director has a relationship with the Company that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including the source of compensation of such director and whether the director is affiliated with the Company (or a subsidiary or affiliate of a subsidiary).
The Board has adopted standards of independence to assist in determining whether a director of the Company is independent. The standards are available on the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com.
The Company's Board of Directors has determined the independence of Directors based on a review conducted by the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee. This determination included consideration of the deposit and payroll accounts the Company maintained at two banking divisions of Zions Bancorporation, National Association ("Zions"), of which Mr. Blackford is an officer. The Board also considered the participation by Zions as the smallest lender in the Company's revolving credit facility, in which there are several lenders. Mr. Blackford had no direct or indirect material interest in the foregoing transactions and the Board concluded that the amounts involved (less than 0.03% of Zion's revenues) were not significant.
With respect to the determination of Mr. Reece's independence, the Board considered that, until his retirement on August 1, 2008, he was the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Reece is serving in a volunteer position as president of a non-profit organization (Cancer League of Colorado), which has received charitable contributions from the MDC/Richmond American Homes Foundation and some Company officers and directors totaling less than $75,000 in 2018. He also serves in a volunteer position as a director of another non-profit organization (Families First of Colorado), which has received charitable contributions from the Foundation and some Company officers totaling less than $20,000 in 2018. The Board concluded that the amounts involved were not significant.
The Board determined that Ms. Leslie B. Fox and each of Messrs. Raymond T. Baker, Michael A. Berman, David E. Blackford, Herbert T. Buchwald, Paris G. Reece III and David Siegel have no material relationship with the Company, each is independent under the NYSE listing standards and each meets the foregoing standards of Director independence adopted by the Board, including for Audit and Compensation Committee membership. The Board determined that each of the foregoing Directors meets the independence standards for Audit Committee membership under the rules of the SEC and they each qualify as a "non-employee director" as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. The Board also determined that Ms. Fox and each of Messrs. Baker, Berman, Blackford, Buchwald and Siegel, but not Mr. Reece, qualify as an "outside director" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
Board Leadership and Risk Oversight.
Larry A. Mizel serves as Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  Mr. Mizel, who founded our Company, has served for 46 years and is the largest shareholder of the Company. He provides effective leadership and guidance in the development of the Company's risk profile, pursuit of its strategic goals and recognition of business opportunities that present themselves.
Herbert T. Buchwald serves as the Company's independent Lead Director. The independent Lead Director presides at the executive sessions of the independent Directors and his authority also includes approving the schedule of Board and Committee meetings and the agendas and topics to be considered at the Board and Committee meetings, coordinating the activities of the various Committees of the Board, advising the Chairman as to the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information from management, and coordinating and developing the agenda for executive sessions of the Board's independent Directors. See "Lead Director" below.
The Board of Directors convenes on a monthly basis and is comprised of a majority of independent Directors. This independent majority and our regular governance practices, including periodic executive sessions of the independent Directors at which the Lead Director presides, provide an effective and independent oversight of management.
Our Board of Directors oversees the Company's management and exposure to risk.  The Board, itself and through its Committees, regularly discusses our material risk exposure, the potential impact on the Company and the efforts of management to manage the risks that are identified.  In meetings with Company management, the head of the internal audit department and the external independent auditors, the Audit Committee reviews regulatory, information technology, financial and accounting risk exposure, reserves and the Company's internal controls. The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, with the guidance of corporate and outside counsel, considers the risks associated with corporate governance.  The Compensation Committee considers risks associated with the elements contained in the Company's compensation programs.  The Legal Committee considers the risks that arise from material litigation, regulatory issues and other legal issues.  Each of our Committees generally reports to the Board on a monthly basis.
For the foregoing reasons, the Company has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate.
Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility 
We believe that sound corporate citizenship and attention to governance and environmental principles are essential to our success. We are committed to operating with integrity, contributing to sustainability of communities across the country through contributions to the MDC/Richmond American Homes Foundation, promoting diversity and inclusion, developing our employees and building our homes with a concern for their impact on the environment. We are also focused on the security of our information technology, including employee and customer data, as noted above. Our Board of Directors provides oversight of these ESG topics (as defined below), and is committed to supporting the Company's efforts to operate as a sound corporate citizen. We believe that an integrated approach to business strategy, corporate governance and corporate citizenship creates long-term value. The following summary highlights certain of our policies and initiatives in these areas.

Board Committees and Related Matters
Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which has been established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, consists of Messrs. Berman, Buchwald and Reece, who serves as Chairman. Mr. Baker withdrew in February 2018, at which time Mr. Berman joined the Committee. Ms. Fox also joined the Committee effective February 2019. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" and "financially literate" in the judgment of the Board of Directors, as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE and the rules of the SEC. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Buchwald is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by applicable SEC regulations. The Board believes that his experience and qualifications described above under "Election of Directors" qualify him to act as the Audit Committee's audit committee financial expert.
The Audit Committee met twelve times during 2018. The organization, functions and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are described in the restated charter for the Audit Committee, which is posted on the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com. The Audit Committee's functions include: assisting the Board in its oversight of the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, oversight of the Company's external auditors, review of the Company's financial statements, review of the annual audit plan and results of the audit, review of any significant modification in accounting policies, oversight of the duties of the Company's internal audit department and discussion of policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management.
Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee met seven times during 2018. The Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Buchwald and Baker, who serves as Chairman. Each member of the committee is independent in the judgment of the Board of Directors, as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE, and has been determined by the Board to qualify as an "outside director" under Section 162(m) of the Code and as a "non-employee director" as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee approves executive compensation plans, reviews salaries, bonuses and other forms of compensation for officers and key employees of the Company, establishes salary levels, benefits and other forms of compensation for employees and addresses other compensation and personnel matters as the Board of Directors from time to time may request. The organization, functions and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are described in the Compensation Committee's restated charter, which is posted on the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com. 
For a discussion of the Company's compensation philosophy and a description of the Company's processes and procedures for the consideration and determination of executive and director compensation, see the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below.
Scope of Authority of Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee has the authority to oversee all employee compensation levels, including benefits. Its goal is to have the Company develop compensation levels that will attract, retain, reward and motivate employees, that are competitive with those prevailing in the marketplace and are consistent with shareholder interests. The Compensation Committee also administers the Company's equity and other compensation plans, as they may be amended from time to time. The Compensation Committee may delegate the day-to-day administrative duties of these plans to Company officers, employees and agents.
The primary components of the Company's executive compensation have been: a base salary, annual performance-based bonuses and equity-based, long-term incentive awards. The Compensation Committee also has discretionary authority to award other forms of executive compensation.
The Compensation Committee reviews and establishes the base salaries for the executive officers annually. The base salaries of Mr. Mizel, the Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mandarich, President and Chief Operating Officer, were established in accordance with their employment agreements with the Company. The base salaries for Mr. Martin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Touff, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, were established in the Compensation Committee's discretion.
Annual bonuses have been awarded to the Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Operating Officer pursuant to the terms of the 2013 Executive Officer Performance-Based Compensation Plan, which was approved by the shareholders in 2013.
The Company's 2018 Performance-Based Plan, adopted by the Compensation Committee and the Board in December 2018 for future performance-based award grants, provides for a broad range of incentive criteria and the adoption of performance goals for the Company's senior executive officers, Messrs. Larry A. Mizel and David D. Mandarich.
Annual bonuses for the Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel may be awarded based on an assessment by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating Officer of each individual's achievement of Key Performance Indicators ("KPIs") established for his position.
The Compensation Committee also has discretionary authority to determine equity awards, including stock options, restricted stock and/or performance share units, granted to the executive officers and may exercise that authority based on its subjective assessment and determination of the individual's performance, contributions to the Company and role in achieving the Company's results and objectives.
Historically, the Company's Board of Directors, and not the Compensation Committee, has exercised the authority to consider and determine Director compensation, including retainer and meeting fees. The Non-Employee Directors receive equity compensation pursuant to the M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. 2011 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors approved by the shareholders in 2011 and amended with shareholder approval in 2016 (the "2011 Director Plan"), under which each Non-Employee Director is granted an option to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock annually. The options are fully vested on the date of the grant and exercisable six months thereafter. In lieu of an option, each Non-Employee Director can elect in advance to receive a restricted stock award that would result in the same expense to the Company as the stock option. Each restricted stock award vests on March 1st of the following year.
Role of Executive Officers regarding Employee and Executive Compensation
Mr. Mizel and Mr. Mandarich, with the assistance of the Company's human resources department, make recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the structure of the compensation plans and proposals for compensation levels for Company employees, including the Chief Financial Officer and the General Counsel. The resources and processes used in making these recommendations involve a review of employee performance with respect to established goals, and overall Company performance subjectively compared to other public homebuilders and the Company's business plan.
The Compensation Committee took these recommendations into account, together with a variety of other inputs, in its decision making process.
Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee.
The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee met six times during 2018. The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee consists of Messrs. Blackford, Buchwald and Siegel, who serves as Chairman.  Each member of the committee is independent in the judgment of the Board of Directors, as defined in the listing standards of the NYSE.  The organization, functions and responsibilities of the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee are described in the committee's charter, which is posted on the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com.  The functions of the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee include development of and recommendations as to corporate governance principles and the Company's Code of Conduct, identification of individuals qualified to become Board members, the review of Director independence, the selection process for Director nominees and oversight of the self-evaluations of the Board and the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance/Nominating Committees.
Procedures for nominating persons for election to the Board are contained in the Company's By-Laws and, accordingly, those procedures constitute the Company's policy with regard to the nomination and consideration of Director candidates recommended by shareholders. The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee will consider candidates identified by shareholders following the procedures set forth in the By-Laws. There have been no changes to these procedures in the last year.
The By-Laws provide that nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a meeting of shareholders by any shareholder entitled to vote for the election of Directors and who complies with the notice procedures set forth in the By-Laws. Specifically, such nominations shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, a shareholder's notice shall be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal offices of the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 75 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. Such shareholder's notice shall set forth in writing the information required by the By-Laws. The chairman of the meeting will determine whether or not the nomination was made in accordance with the foregoing procedure. If it was not, the chairman will so declare and the defective nomination will be disregarded. If it was, the nomination will be considered. The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee may request that additional information be provided in connection with consideration of the nomination.
The Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee believes that all candidates for the Board, including candidates recommended by shareholders, should have experience in appropriate areas and disciplines and, ideally, will add to the experience of current Board members. While the Committee does not have a formal diversity policy, in identifying Director nominees and recommending candidates for nomination by the Board, the Committee considers and assesses, in addition to applicable requirements of law and of the NYSE, the diversity of the candidate's experience, qualifications and background including business experience, specific expertise, strength of character, judgment, and other factors (such as gender, ethnicity and age) deemed appropriate to contribute meaningfully to the Board's capability to serve as effective, engaged stewards of shareholders' interests. The Committee, as well as the full Board, understands that our long-term sustainable future depends on broadening our diversity in the boardroom and among the senior management team. Our current Board members are from various backgrounds and bring a valuable mixed set of skills providing a wide-ranging perspective on the issues important to our company. We anticipate future nominees will reflect the skills, experience and diversity needed to drive the business going forward. Other than for compliance with the procedures set forth in the By-Laws, there is no difference in the manner in which the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee evaluates nominees for Director based on whether the nominee is recommended by a shareholder. At such times as may be appropriate, the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee will lead the search for individuals qualified to become members of the Board, seeking candidates who have diversity of backgrounds, as well as experience with the ability to broaden the diversity of our Board being an advantage. The Committee has authority to engage search firms to identify candidates for nomination to the Board.
Legal Committee.
The Legal Committee met nine times during 2018. The Legal Committee consists of Mr. Buchwald, who serves as Chairman, and Messrs. Blackford and Siegel. Ms. Mizel joined the Committee effective February 2019.   Other than Ms. Mizel, a non-employee director, all Legal Committee members are independent members of the Board of Directors. The Legal Committee provides oversight and review of significant legal affairs of the Company, and it has been active in reviewing legal issues affecting the Company's business with the Company's counsel.  The organization, functions and responsibilities of the Legal Committee are described in the committee's charter, which is posted in the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com. 
Committee Charters.
The Board of Directors has adopted a charter for the Audit Committee, designed to comply with the applicable requirements of the NYSE listing standards and SEC regulations. The Board of Directors also has adopted charters for the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, designed to comply with the applicable requirements of the NYSE listing standards, and a charter for the Legal Committee. These charters are posted under the corporate governance documents on the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com.
Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee, the Board of Directors adopted a set of corporate governance guidelines to implement requirements of the NYSE. These guidelines, as amended, are posted under the corporate governance documents on the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com.
As described in the guidelines, the Compensation Committee considers management succession planning as part of its annual CEO evaluation process. The Compensation Committee then reports on succession planning to the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee.
Regularly Scheduled Executive Sessions of Independent Non-Management Directors.
The Company's corporate governance guidelines provide for the independent Directors to meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management present. The Lead Director presides at the executive sessions. In 2018, three executive sessions were held.
Corporate Code of Conduct.
For many years, the Company has had in place a Corporate Code of Conduct designed to provide that all persons associated with the Company, including employees, officers and Directors, follow the Company's compliance program and legal and ethical obligations and conduct themselves accordingly. The Company's employees, officers and Directors receive annual training on the Corporate Code of Conduct. In 2018, all officers, directors and employees (other than those on leave of absence) participated in the annual training.
The Corporate Code of Conduct includes, among other things, a code of ethics for senior financial officers and Audit Committee complaint procedures, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations. The Corporate Code of Conduct, the code of ethics for senior financial officers and the Audit Committee complaint procedures for handling confidential complaints regarding accounting or auditing matters are posted under the corporate governance documents on the investor relations section of the Company's website, www.mdcholdings.com.
Asset Management Committee.
The Company has in place three Asset Management Committees ("AMC") for reviewing real estate and other corporate transactions. Each real estate AMC is comprised of our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and one of our other corporate officers, with the corporate AMC comprised of our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Each AMC generally meets weekly to review all proposed real estate transactions and other proposed non-real estate transactions at or above certain thresholds. Transactions that exceed certain thresholds also are reviewed by an executive committee of senior officers and the Board of Directors.

Equity Ownership Guidelines for Non-Employee Directors.
In order to strengthen the financial alignment of the Company's Directors with the interests of the Company's shareholders, the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors have established Equity Ownership Guidelines for Directors who are not employees of the Company.  Under these guidelines, each Director is encouraged to acquire and maintain ownership of common stock with an acquisition value, measured at the time of acquisition, of not less than ten times the then annual amount of the retainer paid for serving on the Board of Directors.  The annual amount of the retainer currently is $60,000 resulting in a current stock ownership goal of $600,000 for those Directors who have not previously achieved the goal.  The Directors who have not yet achieved the goal have agreed to retain 100% of the shares they acquire through restricted stock awards and the future exercise of stock options, net of taxes and any option exercise price, up to the number of shares necessary to achieve the goal.  All Directors are in compliance with the Guidelines.  Three of the eight Non-Employee Directors have attained the stock ownership goal.

Over 40 Years of Shareholder Value Creation 
Our Company is one of the leading homebuilders in the United States. Founded in 1972, we have sold over 200,000 new, quality Richmond American homes to homebuyers across the nation.
Our business consists of two primary operations: homebuilding and financial services. The homebuilding operation is comprised of wholly owned subsidiary companies that primarily construct and market single-family detached houses to first-time and first-time move-up homebuyers under the name "Richmond American Homes." Our financial services operations support our homebuilding business.
We strive to generate sustainable long-term value for our shareholders, focusing on our core strength: designing, building and selling quality homes. Homebuilding is a cyclical, often unpredictable, industry. Our business strategy is distinctive among the publicly traded US homebuilders, maximizing risk-adjusted returns while minimizing the risks of excess leverage and land ownership – a strategy designed to outperform over the years.

[END TABLE]
Our strategy has been successful, generating superior returns over time: we are the only publicly traded homebuilder to have maintained both a consistent dividend and robust cash position over the last twenty years, including the recent 2007-2010 housing crisis. As a result of our long-term discipline and conservative asset management, we endured the financial and housing downturn better than virtually all of our peers with a balance sheet that reflected a strong credit profile, long-term maturity duration of debt, top quartile ratings and abundant liquidity. We continue to adhere closely to these principles.
The financial stability resulting from our operating strategy has enabled us to reward our shareholders with a consistent dividend program unmatched in the homebuilding industry.

As a result of their leadership and resolve to enhance shareholder value, while mitigating risk and maintaining the financial integrity of the Company, we have experienced seven years of steady and improving financial results following the severe homebuilding industry downturn.
We maintain a long-term focus and approach:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Consistent Industry Leading Dividends. Paid over $67 million in cash dividends in 2018, extending our track record of reliable capital return to our shareholders to almost 25 years and increasing our annual dividend by 30% to $1.20 in 2018. We also declared an 8% stock dividend in the 2019 first quarter.  
● Continued Improvement to Balance Sheet and Liquidity. We expanded the capacity under our unsecured line of credit from $700 million to $1.0 billion and extended its maturity to December 2023, increasing our liquidity to nearly $1.48 billion at the end of 2018, an increase of 18% over the prior year.

● Strong Financial Results – Top and Bottom Line o   Home sale revenues of $2.98 billion, up 19% year-over-year o   Pre-tax income of $263.9 million, up 15% year-over-year o   Return on equity (pre-tax) of 17.7%, up 80 bps from 16.9%  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Program Structure: Aligning Pay with Performance 
Our compensation program is designed to align executive pay with the drivers of long-term value creation and reward execution of our strategic program.
The annual incentive and long-term compensation programs for our CEO and COO are primarily performance-based utilizing our annual and long term business goals and predetermined challenging metrics tied to the drivers of our long-term shareholder value. The following table outlines our executive compensation program structure in 2018.

 Total Additional Bonus   $5,003,000  
 Total Incentive Bonus (Lesser of $6 million or the calculated amount)   $6,000,000  
[END TABLE]
*  Each of these performance metrics include adjusted pre-tax income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted pre-tax income is calculated by taking pre-tax income and adjusting to exclude unrealized gains or losses on investments, expenses derived from impairments, executive stock-based compensation expense above a budgeted amount, warranty reserve adjustments, and non-recurring or out-of-period charges.
** Adjusted EBITDA s a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, unrealized gains or losses on investments and other non-cash charges derived from impairments, stock-based compensation expense, abandoned project costs, warranty reserve adjustments, and non-recurring or out-of-period charges.
2018 Long-Term Incentive Program 
The long-term incentive program in 2018 includes metrics that measure the Company's long-term value drivers related to the Company's core business. The majority of the program is performance-based and designed to retain, motivate and reward our executive officers for achieving our strategic and financial long-term objectives through the use of performance share units that vest three years from the date of grant provided specific performance targets are achieved.
Additionally, our long-term incentive program in 2018 includes the use of stock options. During 2018, stock options covering 216,000 shares 1 were granted to both the CEO and COO that vest annually over three years subsequent to the grant date. These stock options represented approximately 30% of overall long-term incentive grants to the CEO and COO during 2018 (based on the grant date fair value of the awards), whereas the above-referenced performance share grants represented the remaining 70%.
1 On January 28, 2019, MDC's board of directors approved an 8% stock dividend that was distributed on February 28, 2019 to shareholders of record on February 14, 2019. In accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, share amounts have been restated for any periods or dates prior to the stock dividend record date.

[END TABLE]
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote
Our Compensation Committee is committed to improving our executive compensation programs and modifying them as necessary to maintain the alignment of our executives and shareholders. We continue to engage investors on executive compensation topics and will continue to seek their feedback. We received a positive vote at the 2018 annual shareholders meeting, where our say-on-pay proposal received 93.1% support. Despite this overwhelming support, we have actively engaged with shareholders representing over 45% of our outstanding shares following the 2018 annual meeting. These conversations and feedback greatly help inform our Board of Directors' decision-making process with respect to our compensation and governance practices.
Executive Compensation Program: Plan Design & Components
Key Goals and Objectives
The Compensation Committee aims to design a compensation program that rewards and retains talented executives while motivating them to drive short- and long-term performance. We believe that our ability to retain and motivate our executive officers with their exceptional skills, experience and capacity to succeed in our competitive industry has been essential to the success of our Company and a significant factor in creating long-term value for our shareholders.
Our compensation program reflects the above philosophy and, additionally, prioritizes the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Attracting and retaining talented executives and encouraging their long-term service and loyalty  
● Supporting our long-term business goals and driving performance by closely aligning our compensation metrics and goals with our long-term growth strategy  
● Maintaining a firm link between our executives' and shareholders' long-term interests  
● Prioritizing growth, risk management and financial stability  
● Reflecting shareholder feedback in the compensation program design and related considerations, through regular, ongoing shareholder engagement  
[END TABLE]
Components of Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee designed our compensation program to support the drivers of value and shareholder return over the long term. It is comprised of three primary elements: (i) base salary, (ii) annual incentive award; and (iii) long-term incentive award.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Compensation Component   Description   Purpose   Key  Characteristic  
 Compensation Component   Description   Purpose   Key  Characteristic  
 Base Salary   Cash compensation based on executive officer's role and employment agreement, if any. Salary levels are evaluated annually and may be adjusted for length of service, competitive considerations or recognition of a change in responsibilities.● Provide financial certainty and stability● Attract and retain executive talent● Recognize experience, length of service, competitive market conditions and individual performance   Fixed  
 Annual  Incentive Award   Each year the Compensation Committee approves awards for the CEO and COO, and establishes Key Performance Indicators ("KPIs") for the CFO and CLO. The Compensation Committee determines the extent to which an award is earned and the amount of such award is based on individual and Company performance against pre-established goals.● Motivate executive officer to achieve key annual goals and position the Company for long-term success● Reward executive officer for individual performance and overall Company performance   Variable

 Long-Term  Incentive Award   Each executive officer is eligible to receive an award at the discretion of the Compensation Committee based upon long-term performance potential.● Provide an incentive for executive officers to achieve long-term sustainable success for the Company and to promote shareholder value● Attract, motivate, reward and retain executive talent   Variable  
[END TABLE]
The net effect of our pay design is that both for the CEO and the other NEOs, a large majority of total direct compensation is at-risk, and dependent on Company, individual, or stock performance.
Fixed Compensation
Base Salary
The Compensation Committee sets executive officer base salaries at a level that reflects the competitive market for these roles as well as each individual's performance, skills and experience. In 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to maintain CEO and COO base salaries unchanged from their 2017 levels, meaning CEO and COO base salary have remained unchanged for over a decade. In light of exceptional performance and to ensure alignment with peer group levels, the Compensation Committee approved a $60,000/year increase to the CFO's base salary. The CLO's base salary remained unchanged from 2017.
Variable and Performance-Based Compensation
2018 Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer Annual Incentive Bonus
Our annual incentive compensation program is designed to retain, motivate and reward the CEO and COO for their respective contributions in achieving the Company's annual financial goals by focusing their attention on the following key economic drivers: return on equity, home sale revenues, pre-tax earnings per share, net new orders and EBITDA. Significant year-over-year performance is essential to our short-term financial results and, ultimately, our long-term success.
Annual Bonus Calculation Formula: Links to Key Metrics
The 2018 performance goal included a condition precedent for any bonus earned by requiring a minimum consolidated adjusted pre-tax return on beginning equity to exceed 6.0% (the "ROE Condition"). The actual adjusted pre-tax ROE was 20.8%, satisfying the ROE Condition, and as such, the CEO and COO earned a $1.2 million bonus.
Once the ROE Condition was met, the CEO and COO each had the opportunity to earn additional bonuses (the "Additional Bonus Opportunity") as described below.
Outcomes Reflect Alignment with Performance
Based in part on shareholder feedback, the Additional Bonus Opportunity for the CEO and COO for 2018 was based on four distinct sets of financial goals, as set forth below. The Committee believes that achievement of these goals, in concert, is important for long term shareholder value creation.
The targets set forth below represent a required improvement over 2017 performance.

The appropriateness of the categories selected for 2018, along with target and threshold goal amounts, were carefully considered by the Compensation Committee given the Company's emphasis on prioritizing growth, risk management, financial stability and pursuit of long-term value. Specifically, with respect to the Home Sale Revenues, Adjusted Pre-Tax Diluted EPS, Net New Orders and EBITDA goals, the minimum performance criteria was established based on the prior year actual performance with target levels based on the 2018 Business Plan. The target goals represent a required improvement over 2017 actual performance. Bonuses earned for each metric were adjusted on a pro-rata basis if actual results were between Threshold and Target.
The 2018 Business Plan was developed by the CEO, COO and CFO from the "ground up" utilizing (i) forecasts submitted by the presidents for each of the Company's homebuilding divisions detailing their operational projections for each of their divisions' communities, (ii) the forecast submitted for the mortgage company by its president; and (iii) forecasts from the CFO regarding the insurance companies, any other income producing divisions of the Company, and all the corporate general and administrative departments. The 2018 Business Plan was reviewed by the Board. The process of developing the business plan incorporates a disciplined evaluation of risks identified by management and the Board to establish a reasonable range of potential performance goals for the year including general economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates, variations in projected mortgage lending programs, the availability and cost of capital, the availability and acquisition cost of land, materials and contractors in the homebuilding operations, potential for shortages and the increased cost of labor, and increased governmental regulation, including the adverse interpretation of tax, labor and environmental laws.
Target performance goals were established to reflect outstanding performance in light of the risks and market conditions anticipated for 2018.
Based on the achievements in these categories, both the CEO and COO earned an additional bonus of $5.0 million related to the Additional Bonus Opportunity as shown below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018 Short-Term Incentive Program

 Adjusted EBITDA   $394.9 million   $330.0 million   $1,500,000  
[END TABLE]
Bonus Payment Cap
The 2018 annual incentive bonus (the ROE Condition Bonus plus the Additional Bonus Opportunity) was subject to a $6.0 million cap (the "Bonus Cap") established by the Compensation Committee based on guidance from its Compensation Consultant taking into account each executive's historic compensation, reference to executive compensation being awarded to the Company's peer group and feedback from its shareholders.
In addition, any bonus earned in excess of $5.0 million would be paid in restricted stock shares vesting in equal amounts on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. The Compensation Committee believes that remuneration of a portion of the bonus in form of restricted stock serves as a retention tool and reflects the alignment of interests between the CEO/COO and other shareholders.
2018 CFO and General Counsel Annual Incentive Bonus
The CFO and CLO positions are primarily responsible for accounting, finance, legal and regulatory compliance and, in the judgment of the Compensation Committee, their incentive compensation should not directly depend on the Company's financial performance. Instead, the CLO and the CFO were awarded a bonus opportunity measured by specific Key Performance Indicators ("KPIs") established by the Compensation Committee, their attainment and a bonus payment commensurate with a percentage of their base pay. The Compensation Committee consults with the CEO and COO with regard to their achievements. For 2018, the Compensation Committee established the following KPIs:
Chief Financial Officer
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Shareholder relations management and oversight  
● Timely and accurate handling of financial regulatory filings  
● Oversight of accounting, finance, information technology and treasury functions, including capital markets and bank financing transactions, if applicable  
● Successful completion of special projects  
[END TABLE]
General Counsel
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Litigation management  
● Regulatory compliance  
● Successful completion of special projects  
● Oversight of risk management  
[END TABLE]
The KPIs were weighted equally, with bonus amounts based on the level of the performance they achieved:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A target bonus of 100% of base salary if the Compensation Committee determined that each KPI was achieved.  
● A maximum bonus of 200% of base salary if the Compensation Committee determined that each KPI has been exceeded at a level doubling the targeted performance.  
● Proportionate bonus levels as a percentage of base salary to the extent some KPIs were partially achieved or exceeded.  
[END TABLE]
Based on its evaluation of performance relative to the established KPIs, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Martin and Mr. Touff 2018 annual incentive bonuses of $1,025,000 and $575,000, respectively. Mr. Martin's incentive bonus is comprised of $750,000 payable in cash and $275,000 in restricted stock shares. Mr. Touff's incentive bonus is comprised of $500,000 payable in cash and $75,000 in restricted stock shares. The restricted stock shares vest in equal amounts on the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant.
Long-Term Incentive Compensation
For our CEO and COO, the 2018 long-term equity grants were delivered approximately 70% in performance stock units and 30% in stock options (based on the grant date fair value of the awards), while the CFO grant was entirely in performance stock units. Our long-term incentive program is heavily weighted in performance stock units in order to objectively align the incentives of the Company's management team with the interests of our shareholders.
Performance Stock Units (PSUs): Metrics
Executives will have their PSU awards vest if they meet the challenging financial and operating goals which have been established to improve our long-term performance.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Long-Term Incentive Metrics  
 Metric   Link to Value Drivers  
 Home Sale Revenues    Home sale revenues are an industry standard directly linked to the Company's financial stability and revenue growth  
 Minimum Gross Margin from Home Sales Before Impairments Threshold    Gross margin is an industry standard that investors use to gauge the strength of our business as a measure that costs are being managed effectively  
[END TABLE]
2018 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards
The awards will vest based on increasing average home sale revenues over a three-year performance period compared to home sale revenues over a base period, while maintaining a minimum average gross margin from home sales (excluding impairments) of at least fifteen percent (15%).
2018 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Target-Setting Process
The Compensation Committee set clear, ambitious, long-term revenue growth targets over a three-year period. In determining the appropriate targets, the Compensation Committee considered the Company's long term strategic plan, historic performance, peer group performance, anticipated broader business, market conditions and the Company's current backlog.
The Target Goal established for each award was based on the Company achieving a three-year average Revenue over the period commencing April 1, 2018 and ending March 31, 2021 (the "Performance Period") that was at least 10% but less than 20% greater than the Revenue over the period commencing April 1, 2017 and ending March 31, 2018 (the "Base Period"). The Threshold Goal was based on three-year average Revenue over the Performance Period that was at least 5% but less than 10% greater than Revenue over the Base Period. The Maximum Goal was based on three-year average Revenue over the Performance Period that was at least 20% greater than Revenue over the Base Period. The number of PSUs earned shall be adjusted to be proportional to the partial performance between the Threshold Goals, Target Goals and Maximum Goals.

Peer Data and Benchmarking to the Market
The Compensation Committee utilized peer data as a reference when it considered the incentives and compensation plan design. It was not employed for benchmarking purposes. Rather, the peer group information was considered for broad subjective comparisons and not as an objective metric.

Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain outside counsel, consultants and other advisors to assist it in evaluating compensation or in otherwise discharging its duties and responsibilities. After consideration of independence factors as required by the NYSE, the Compensation Committee previously engaged Compensation & Benefit Solutions, LLC to advise the Compensation Committee regarding the structuring of executive compensation for 2018. The Compensation Committee engaged WealthPoint, LLC to advise the Committee in connection with year-end 2018 compensation determinations, the structuring of executive compensation for 2019 and the compensation disclosures to be included in this proxy statement. These consultants also assisted the Compensation Committee in determining appropriate peers for purposes of comparing (but not benchmarking) market compensation, and provided other related services.
The consultants have not provided any services to the Company other than the services provided to the Compensation Committee. After considering, among other matters, the absence of any business or personal relationship between the consultants and any member of the Compensation Committee or any executive officer of the Company, the Compensation Committee has concluded the consultants' services do not raise any conflicts of interest.
Other Compensation Considerations
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Company's executive officers as a group have historically maintained a high percentage of ownership of Company stock, especially when compared against other companies in the homebuilding industry. For example, Messrs. Mizel, Mandarich, Martin and Touff beneficially own shares totaling approximately 25% of the Company's shares. See Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock – Ownership of Directors and Officers, above.
Nonetheless, in response to feedback received from the investor community, the Company has adopted formal equity ownership guidelines for the executive officers in order to expressly promote their continued short and long term financial alignment with the interests of the shareholders of the Company. Under the guidelines, each executive officer is encouraged to acquire and maintain ownership of common stock of the Company having an acquisition value of not less than the following multiple of the executive officer's base annual salary:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officer   Multiple  
 CEO   5X  
 COO   5X  
 All Others   1X  
[END TABLE]
To expedite achievement of the goal set forth above, each executive officer who has not yet achieved the goal agrees to retain the shares they acquire through restricted stock awards and the future exercise of employee stock options, net of taxes and any option exercise price, up to the number of shares necessary to achieve the goal. Messrs. Mizel, Mandarich, Martin and Touff have all achieved and maintain the stock ownership goal.
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies
Our Directors and executive officers are prohibited from acquiring an interest in financial instruments intended to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's stock held directly or indirectly by that person. They also are required to inform the Company's compliance committee and obtain pre-clearance prior to purchasing Company stock on margin, margining Company stock or pledging Company stock as collateral for a loan.
Clawback Policy
In January 2015, based in part on shareholder feedback, the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee approved a "Clawback" Policy. The Company's Clawback Policy authorizes the Company to recover compensation previously paid to executive officers of the Company that was based upon any metric contained in a financial statement that was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the Company's then-current fiscal year or during one of the three prior fiscal years, which metric was materially restated.
Compensation and Risk Management
As part of its annual risk assessment, the Compensation Committee reviews the Company's compensation policies and practices to confirm that the programs are designed in a manner that does not motivate individuals or groups to take risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Based on the Compensation Committee's annual risk assessment, the Company believes that its compensation policies and practices for its employees, including executive officers, do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company, and that such policies and practices are designed with strong oversight mechanisms in place.
Tax Considerations
Effective for tax years beginning on January 1, 2018 or later, Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) was amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA"), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The tax reform legislation repealed the performance-based compensation exception to the Section 162(m) $1 million deduction limitation. The definition of a "covered employee" was revised to include the principal financial officer and any individual who held the position of either principal executive officer or principal financial officer at any time during the taxable year.
Previously, the Section 162(m) deductibility limitation was subject to an exception for compensation that qualified as "performance-based". The Company was able to deduct certain performance-based compensation in excess of $1 million paid to our CEO and the three other most highly paid executives (excluding our CFO). Our compensation programs were designed to permit our Company to qualify for the "performance-based" exception, although the Company reserved the right to pay compensation that did not qualify as "performance-based".
The TCJA revisions included a transition rule that allows payments to be deductible based on the application of the Section 162(m) rules in effect prior to the change if the payments are made pursuant to a "written binding contract" that was in effect on November 2, 2017, and has not since been materially modified. Because the transition rule only applies to "written binding contracts," it may not apply in cases where an agreement provides that an employer retains negative discretion. Starting in 2018, all compensation paid to NEOs in excess of $1 million will be non-deductible (except for any amounts that qualify as performance-based that have been grandfathered pursuant to the written binding contract transition rule under the TCJA).
In light of the TCJA, the Compensation Committee and the Board adopted a new 2018 Executive Officer Performance-Based Compensation Plan and is proposing to our Shareholders an amendment to the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan that, in addition to authorizing the issuance of additional shares, will reflect changes implemented by the TCJA.  The Compensation Committee is continuing to assess the impact of Section 162(m), as amended, on our compensation programs.
Medical Insurance Benefits
Under the terms of their respective employment agreements, each of the CEO and COO is entitled to medical insurance benefits for the duration of his life (described in more detail below under "Employment Agreements").
Other Compensation
In 2018 our executive officers also received compensation in the form of 401(k) employer contributions, incremental travel expenses incurred by the Company in support of not-for-profit organizations (as approved by the Board) and cell phone allowances.
The Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company for its CEO and its COO to use the Company's aircraft for non-Company purposes, when the aircraft is not being employed in the ordinary course of Company business. The CEO and the COO reimburse the Company for their non-Company use of the aircraft.
The objective of these benefits is to provide amenities to the CEO and COO that allow them to more efficiently utilize their time and to support them in effectively contributing to the success of the Company.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

2 The option granted will become exercisable equally over three years, starting with the first anniversary of the grant date. The option granted was part of the executive's 2018 long term incentive compensation.  
3 The PSUs will be earned based upon the Company's performance, over a three year period commencing April 1, 2018 and ending March 31, 2021 (the "Performance Period"), measured by increasing average home sale revenues over the Base Period. The "Base Period" for the awards is April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018.

The number of PSUs earned under these grants shall be adjusted to be proportional to the partial performance between the Threshold Goals, Target Goals and Maximum Goals.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich
The Company entered into employment agreements with Mr. Mizel and Mr. Mandarich, which have been amended over time and most recently as of October 18, 2013. The agreements provide for the executives' continued employment with the Company: Mr. Mizel as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Mandarich as President and Chief Operating Officer. The agreements specify a minimum base salary, incentive compensation and medical benefits during the executive's employment as well as medical benefits upon the executive's retirement, disability or termination.
On March 8, 2012, the employment agreements were amended to provide a double trigger on the non-equity vesting portions of the agreements' change-in-control provision and to increase the percentage threshold in the change-in-control definition from 20% to 50%.
On October 18, 2013 the Company reached agreements (collectively, the "Second Amendments") with the CEO and COO for the early termination, as of June 30, 2013, of the non-qualified retirement benefits contained in their respective employment agreements.
Material terms of the employment agreements are summarized below.
Employment Term: The agreements automatically extend for two-year terms unless (1) the Company or the executive elects to terminate by six months written notice, or (2) the executive is terminated earlier. Neither party has given notice of termination.
Base Salaries: Mr. Mizel's base salary may not be less than $1,000,000 per year. Mr. Mandarich's base salary may not be less than $830,000 per year. The base salary for the executive may only be reduced below his prior year's base salary with the consent of the executive and the Company.
Incentive Compensation: Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich participate in the Company's incentive compensation plans ("Performance Plans").
Medical Insurance Benefits: The Company provides medical insurance benefits to Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich for the duration of their lives. This applies to each of them while he is employed and for the rest of his life after employment. The medical insurance coverage and benefits are at least comparable to those provided to the executive at the time the agreement was signed. The medical insurance benefits also provide comparable coverage for the executive's spouse for the duration of the executive's life and, if she survives the executive, for an additional sixty months after his death.
Long-Term Disability Benefits: The Company will provide the executive with long-term disability benefits. Under the benefits, the annual after-tax amount received by the executive would equal the after-tax amount of his base salary for the year in which he becomes disabled. This long-term disability benefit would be paid monthly until the earlier of the end of the executive's disability or prior to his becoming totally disabled. If the executive dies or becomes totally disabled during his employment, he or his estate will be entitled to receive all benefits earned under his Performance Plan and equity plans.
Vacation: The executive is entitled to receive six weeks of vacation each year without carryover from year to year.
Termination for Cause: The executive may be terminated for cause, as defined in their employment agreements. If either is terminated for cause, he will only be entitled to his base salary earned through the date of termination and will not be entitled to any other amounts under his employment agreement.
Termination Without Cause: If the executive is terminated without cause he will be entitled to receive:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● an amount equal to his aggregate base salary during the three years prior to his termination; and  
● an amount equal to 300%, for Mr. Mizel, and 200%, for Mr. Mandarich, of the annual incentive compensation paid for the year prior to termination.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the executive's options and other rights under the equity plans would vest immediately and the executive, his spouse and his dependents would be entitled to continued medical benefits. Under the employment agreements, termination without cause includes the Company's election not to extend the term of the employment agreement and the Company's termination of the Performance Plans.
Change in Control Provisions: If a change in control of the Company occurs, all of the options, dividend equivalents and other rights granted to Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich under the equity plans and other Company plans would accelerate and become exercisable immediately before the occurrence of the transaction that caused the change in control. If the transaction is not completed, the options would remain subject to the restrictions to which they were originally subject.
If a change in control occurs, followed within two years by a material change, the executive can terminate his employment (if he has not already been terminated) within thirty days of the material change. If the executive terminates his employment due to a change in control, then:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● he will receive an amount equal to his aggregate base salary during the three years prior to his termination;  
● he will receive an amount equal to 300%, for Mr. Mizel, and 200%, for Mr. Mandarich, of the annual incentive compensation paid for the year prior to termination;  
● he will be entitled to the accelerated vesting of options and rights; and  
● if the change in control involved a two-tier tender offer, at the executive's election the Company will either: (1) pay the executive the difference between the exercise price of the otherwise unvested options and the price offered in the first tier; or (2) adjust the option terms to provide the executive with an equivalent value.  
[END TABLE]
Excess Parachute Payments: Certain payments that Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich may receive could be subject to an excise tax as an "excess parachute payment" under the Internal Revenue Code. This could occur following a change in control, a material change, or through other payments made to the executives. In their employment agreements, Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich have agreed to be paid those amounts, if any, in annual installments and over the shortest period of time in which they may be paid and not be treated as "excess parachute payments."
Change in Control and Material Change Defined
A "change in control," which is defined more fully in the employment agreements, occurs when:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a report on Schedule 13D is filed with the SEC that discloses that any person is the beneficial owner of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the Company. However, it will not be a change in control if that person is the Company or one of its subsidiaries, an employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company, or any Director as of the date of the employment agreements or his or her affiliate;  
● any person purchases securities through a tender offer or exchange offer if after the offer is completed the person in question is the beneficial owner of fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the Company. However, it will not be a change in control if that person is the Company or one of its subsidiaries, an employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company, or any Director as of the date of the employment agreements or his or her affiliate;  
● the Company's shareholders approve a consolidation or merger after which the Company would not be the continuing or surviving corporation;  
● the Company's shareholders approve a consolidation or merger in which shares of Company's common stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the shareholders approve any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Company; or  
● the majority of the Board of Directors ceases to be composed of Directors who were on the Board at the beginning of any twelve-month period. However, it will not be a change in control if the election or nomination of each new director was approved by the vote of two-thirds of the Directors in office who were directors at the beginning of that twelve-month period.  
[END TABLE]
A "material change," which is defined more fully in the employment agreements, occurs when:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the Company makes certain adverse changes in the executive's reporting relationship, titles, functions or duties;  
● the Company (without the executive's consent) terminates the Performance Plans or amends them to provide for reduced payments to the executive;  
● the Company assigns or reassigns the executive, without his written permission, to another place of employment 50 miles or more from his residence;  
● the Company reduces the executive's base salary, annual incentive compensation, retirement benefits, long-term incentive compensation, or the manner in which the compensation is determined, or breaches the employment agreement; or  
● a purchaser of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or any successor or assignee of the Company fails to assume the employment agreement.  
[END TABLE]
See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below for additional information.
Certain Other Change in Control Agreements
Mr. Martin and Mr. Touff entered into change in control agreements with the Company effective May 23, 2015 and July 30, 2008, respectively. Each agreement will terminate on the earlier of termination of employment or the end of the current one-year term of the agreement. However, unless either party to the agreement elects by notice in writing delivered to the other at least 90 days prior to December 31 of the current term, the term of the agreement will be renewed automatically for successive one-year terms. In addition, if the agreement has not been terminated prior to a change in control (as defined below), upon a change in control, the term of the agreement will extend automatically following such change in control for two years.
The definition of change in control is generally the same as the definition in the description of the employment agreements above.
For purposes of Messrs. Martin's and Touff's agreements, a change in control event occurs if a change in control is followed by a material change within two years. A material change is defined in the agreements to occur if:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the agreements);  
● the Company makes certain adverse changes in the employee's reporting relationship, titles, functions or duties;  
● the Company assigns or reassigns the employee, without his written permission, to another place of employment more than fifty miles from his current place of employment;  
● the Company reduces the employee's base salary, annual or long-term incentive compensation, or the manner in which the compensation is determined unless the reduction applies to other officers of the Company; or  
● a purchaser of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or any successor or assignee of the Company fails to assume the agreement.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to each agreement, if a change in control event occurs, the employee may elect within 90 days after the change in control event to terminate his employment, if not previously terminated by the Company, and to receive a change in control payment. The change in control payment (to be paid upon termination of employment by either the Company or the employee) equals two times the sum of: (i) the employee's annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the change in control event, plus (ii) the amount of the employee's last regular annual bonus, provided that the amount of the annual bonus shall not exceed 50% of the annual base salary in effect immediately prior to the change in control event.
If a change in control event occurs, the employee also would be entitled to continue to participate in the Company's employee benefit plans, policies and arrangements that provide insurance and medical benefits on the same basis as provided prior to the change in control event for a period of twelve months after the date of termination of his employment.
If a change in control as defined above occurs, all options, dividend equivalents and other rights granted to the employee under any Company equity incentive plan will be accelerated and become exercisable immediately prior to the closing of the change in control. If the change in control is not concluded, the election to exercise such options and other rights shall be of no effect and the options shall remain subject to their original restrictions.
Any amounts payable pursuant to the change in control agreement are in addition to any payments otherwise payable to the employee pursuant to any agreement, plan or policy of the Company. Certain payments that the employee may receive could be subject to an excise tax as an "excess parachute payment" under the Internal Revenue Code. This could occur following a change in control or a change in control event, either alone or together with other payments made to the employee. In the agreement, the employee has agreed to be paid those amounts, if any, in annual installments and over the shortest period of time in which they may be paid and not be treated as "excess parachute payments."
See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below for additional information.
The Compensation Committee believes that the potential payments in these limited change in control circumstances fit well within the Company's overall compensation philosophy. The termination and change in control payments are calculated based on the base salaries and the annual bonuses paid to the executives. The Committee believes that the long-term interests of our shareholders are aligned with the executives in that their compensation is, in turn, aligned with the success of the Company. The potential change of control compensation varies with the compensation previously paid to the executive, affords stability to the Company's leadership and is consistent with the philosophy of the Committee to provide compensation that assures retention, incentive and reward to the executive team. 
Amendments to Restricted Stock and Stock Option Agreements Awarded to the Company's Named Executive Officers 
On February 6, 2019, the compensation committee amended the Restricted Stock and Stock Option Agreements previously awarded to the Company's named executive officers under the M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan such that in the event of death or disability the restricted stock and/or stock option awards will fully vest, all restricted stock restrictions will lapse and all options will become fully exercisable.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL
The following table shows potential payments to our named executive officers under existing contracts for various scenarios involving a change in control or termination of employment, assuming a triggering event on the last business day of 2018. Please see the narrative above under "Employment Agreements" and "Certain Other Change in Control Agreements" for a description of payments contemplated by these agreements.

1 Following both a change in control and a material change, Messrs. Mizel, Mandarich, Martin and Touff may elect to terminate employment and receive the identified benefits.
2 Calculated as the aggregate base salary earned by the executive during the prior three years. This amount does not include any amount that may be payable upon a two-tier tender offer that results in a change of control. See footnote 4 below.
3 Under the executive's employment agreement, this is calculated as of December 31, 2018 at 300% for Mr. Mizel and 200% for Mr. Mandarich of the "Annual Incentive Compensation" paid for 2017. 
4 Amount is the value of unvested restricted stock at December 31, 2018 plus an amount representing the difference between MDC's stock price at December 31, 2018 and the exercise price of unvested options, to the extent that the stock price exceeds the exercise price. Under the executive's employment agreement, the vesting of all options, dividend equivalents and other rights granted under equity incentive plans and any other Company plans would be accelerated so as to permit the executive to fully exercise all outstanding options and rights, if any, granted to the executive. In the event a change in control involves a two-tier tender offer, the Company would pay the executive (at the executive's election) the difference between the exercise price of the otherwise unvested options and the price offered in the first tier, or adjust the option terms to provide the executive with an equivalent value. In addition, this amount also includes the value of all unvested performance share units pursuant to the terms of the performance share unit grant agreement. 
5 The amount shown is the total projected medical insurance benefit obligation for the executive, which would provide medical benefits that are at least comparable to those provided to the executive at the time his employment agreement was signed. After the end of his employment term, the date the executive becomes totally disabled, the date of the executive's termination without cause or the executive's election to terminate his employment following a change in control (but not in the event of termination for cause), the Company will pay the medical insurance benefit for the duration of the executive's life. The medical insurance benefit also provides comparable coverage for the executive's spouse for duration of the executive's life and, if she survives him, for an additional 60 months after his death. This amount is estimated based on 2018 costs incurred by the Company.
6 Upon the occurrence of the specified event, Messrs. Martin and Touff shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to 200% of their respective annual base salaries.
7 For each of Messrs. Martin and Touff the amount is calculated as two times the amount equal to each named executive's last regular annual bonus, provided that for these purposes, such regular annual bonus amount shall not exceed 50% of his annual base salary at the rate in effect immediately before the change in control event.
8 Represents the value of all unvested restricted stock and performance share unit awards, which would become fully vested upon a termination by the Company without cause pursuant to the terms of the restricted stock award agreement.
9 Amount is the value of unvested restricted stock at December 31, 2018, plus an amount representing the difference between MDC's stock price at December 31, 2018 and the exercise price of unvested options, to the extent that the stock price exceeds the exercise price. If a change in control occurs, all options, dividend equivalents and other rights granted to the employee under any Company equity incentive plans shall be accelerated and shall become exercisable immediately prior to the closing of the change in control so as to permit the employee fully to exercise all outstanding options and rights. In addition, this amount also includes the value of all unvested performance share units pursuant to the terms of the performance share unit grant agreement. 
10 The employee shall also be entitled to continue to participate in each of the Company's employee benefit plans, policies or arrangements which provide insurance and medical benefits on the same basis as was provided to the employee prior to the change in control event for a period of 12 months after the date of termination of employee's employment. This amount is estimated based on 2018 costs incurred by the Company.
11 These amounts represent the pro rata value of each executive's performance share units at December 31, 2018, upon death or disability, pursuant to the terms of the performance share unit agreements. On February 6, 2019, the compensation committee amended the Restricted Stock and Stock Option Agreements previously awarded to the Company's named executive officers under the M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan such that in the event of death or disability the restricted stock and/or stock option awards will fully vest, all restricted stock restrictions will lapse and all options will become fully exercisable.
2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
We believe that effective corporate governance begins with a diverse, skilled and engaged Board of Directors. We are proud to report that our Board is more diverse, skilled and engaged than ever. In 2018, your directors attended 100% of their Board and committee meetings. The Board is comprised of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Ten directors with extensive financial, senior management and/or operational expertise;  
● Eight directors with extensive real estate and/or homebuilding industry experience;  
● Five directors extensively engaged in philanthropy in support of health, safety, social issues and the general welfare of the community and the nation; and  
● Two highly qualified female directors who have joined the Board over the last two years.  
[END TABLE]
Your Board takes very seriously its responsibility to provide oversight, guidance and support for senior management. For this reason, we have established multiple mechanisms to facilitate frequent communication with senior management including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Robust involvement of the independent Lead Director;  
● Comprehensive oversight of operations, risk-management and business strategy through monthly Board, Audit and Legal Committee meetings.  
● Significant shareholder engagement with over 45% (by shares held) of the non-affiliated investors.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board periodically reviews director compensation in collaboration with the Compensation Committee and its compensation consultant with reference to comparable individual and peer group director fees and prevailing market practices. The Board takes into consideration a number of specific factors attributable to the directors' service on the Board, including the Company's higher-than-usual frequency of Board, Audit and Legal Committee meetings, which are conducted on a regular monthly basis, Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee meetings, which are held periodically, as required, with interim communications arising during the month, as necessary, and significant preparation before each meeting. Our Directors are engaged, active and expected to attend meetings fully prepared to thoughtfully participate and meaningfully contribute.
During 2018, each Director (excluding the Lead Director) who was not an officer of the Company ("Non-Employee Director") earned a retainer in the amount of $5,000 per month and the amount of $3,000 for each Board meeting attended. Committee members (excluding the Lead Director) earned $3,000 for each Audit Committee meeting attended and $2,500 for each Compensation and/or Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee meeting attended. The members of the Legal Committee (also excluding the Lead Director) earned a retainer in the amount of $2,000 per month. In addition, the chairmen of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance/Nominating Committee each received a retainer in the amount of $1,250 per month. Mr. Berman received a retainer of $2,000 per month for his service as a director on the Board of HomeAmerican, which conducted four meetings during the year. The Lead Director earned $32,500 per month for performance of the duties and responsibilities established by the Board and his service as a member on all of the committees. Each Director is also reimbursed for expenses related to their attendance at Board and committee meetings.
Pursuant to the M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. 2011 Director Plan, approved by the shareholders in 2011 and amended with shareholder approval in 2016, each Non-Employee Director is annually granted a vested option to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock. The stock options are not exercisable until six months after the date of the grant. In lieu of acceptance of the stock option, each Non-Employee Director has the opportunity to elect, in advance and instead of the option grant, to receive an award of restricted stock in an amount valued at the equivalent reportable expense to the Company of the option grant. The restricted stock awards vest on March 1st of the following year.
The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation of the Company's Non-Employee Directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The two Directors (Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich) who are executive officers receive no compensation for serving as Directors in addition to the compensation received as executive officers.

[END TABLE]
1 Each Non-Employee Director was granted a vested option to purchase 25,000 shares of common stock or a restricted stock award of equivalent value on August 1, 2018. The dollar amount shown for each Director is the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.  For details on the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted, see Note 21 (Stock Based Compensation) to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Baker, Berman, Buchwald, Reece and Siegel had outstanding option grants of 149,472, 39,247, 61,236, 91,854 and 214,326 shares, respectively. Messrs. Blackford, Buchwald, Reece and Siegel and Mses. Mizel and Fox had unvested restricted stock awards of 5,466 each.   
2 The amounts shown for "Other" represent Incremental Costs incurred by the Company in support of these Board members' service to not-for-profit organizations, consistent with the Company's commitment to sustainability.
CEO PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
Pursuant to SEC rules, to determine our median employee, we used W-2 compensation for our entire employee population, all of whom are located within the United States.  As of December 31, 2017, we identified our median employee (excluding our CEO from the calculation). During the last completed fiscal year there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change to the pay ratio disclosure.  Accordingly, we are using the same median employee in our pay ratio calculation. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we calculated that median employee's total compensation using the same methodology that we used to calculate the total compensation for our CEO.  The 2018 annual total compensation of the median employee and our CEO, respectively, were $100,330 and $11,605,548. The ratio of the 2018 annual total compensation for our CEO to that of our median employee was 116 to 1.
COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND RISK MANAGEMENT
The Company believes that its compensation policies and practices for its employees, including executive officers, do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
The following persons served as members of the Compensation Committee during 2018: Raymond T. Baker and Herbert T. Buchwald. None of the committee members were, during the last fiscal year, officers or employees of the Company, none were formerly officers of the Company and none had a material interest in a "related person" transaction since the beginning of 2018. During 2018, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSAL TWO   ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended and SEC Rule 14a-21(a), we are providing our shareholders the opportunity to vote on a non-binding, advisory resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers (say-on-pay), which is described in this Proxy Statement.
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders hereby approve on an advisory basis the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion."
We have been providing these advisory votes on an annual basis. The 2018 advisory vote resulted in more than 93% of the votes cast in favor of the advisory resolution. Following the 2019 Annual Meeting, the next advisory say-on-pay vote will be held at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
As described above under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," we believe that our ability to retain and motivate named executive officers with the skills, experience and capacity to succeed in our competitive industry has been essential to the success of our Company and a significant factor in creating long-term value for our shareholders. Our compensation philosophy recognizes the value of rewarding our executive officers for their past performance and motivating them to continue to excel in the future. We endeavor to deliver fair and appropriate compensation to our executive officers that is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Board of Directors believes the Company's compensation programs are tailored to retain and motivate key executives in alignment with maintaining and creating long-term value for our shareholders. The Board of Directors urges you to review carefully the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, which describes our compensation philosophy and programs in greater detail.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favor of the Company's executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement by voting FOR this proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSAL THREE   APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE M.D.C. HOLDINGS, INC. 2011 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the approval of the Amendment to the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan.
At our 2011 Annual Meeting, our shareholders approved the M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2011 Equity Plan"). After our 2017 Annual Meeting, at which our shareholders approved a third amendment to the 2011 Equity Plan, a total of 6,488,750 shares of Common Stock were authorized for issuance to our employees under the plan. In December 2017, the Company distributed an 8% stock dividend adding 519,100 shares and, in February 2019, the Company distributed another 8% stock dividend adding 560,628 shares, resulting in a total of 7,568,478 shares available for issuance under the plan. Following all awards made under the plan, approximately 631,216 shares currently remain available to be awarded.
On December 10, 2018, based on the recommendation of our Compensation Committee, our Board approved, subject to shareholder approval, a fourth amendment (the "Amendment") to Section 4.1 of the 2011 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock available under the plan by an additional 2,000,000 shares.
The Amendment revises the first two sentences of Section 4.1 by replacing the number 6,488,750 (now, 7,568,478 following the stock dividends) with the number 9,568,478. With the Amendment, the first two sentences of Section 4.1 are as follows:
4.1 Number of Shares. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14, the maximum number of shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be 9,568,478 shares. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 14, 9,568,478 shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be available for issuance pursuant to Incentive Stock Options.
In addition, the Amendment amends certain provisions related to performance-based awards in connection with recent amendments to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Code") that eliminated the exception to the $1 million deductibility limit for "covered employees" imposed by Section 162(m).
Copies of the Amendment and the 2011 Equity Plan, as amended by the proposed Amendment, are set forth in Appendix A and Appendix B, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference.
Overview and Principles
Attracting, rewarding and retaining highly qualified officers and key employees, and motivating them to serve the Company and its affiliated entities and to expend maximum efforts, is important to our growth and success. Equity awards are an important element of our compensation program because stock options, restricted stock and other equity awards enable our officers and key employees to acquire or increase their proprietary interest in the operations and future success of our Company, thereby promoting a close alignment of interests between such individuals and our shareholders.
Current Awards Outstanding
Set forth below is information regarding awards currently outstanding under the 2011 Equity Plan, the M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. 2011 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors and prior plans. The Company made an annual award grant to employees in January and February 2019, and those awards are included in the data below.
Selected Data as of March 1, 2019:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Stock options outstanding   5,886,179  
 Weighted average exercise price   $23.45  
 Weighted average remaining contractual life   4.8 years  
 Restricted shares outstanding    399,092  
 Shares remaining for grant under the 2011 Equity Plan   631,216  
 Common stock outstanding   61,338,701  
[END TABLE]
Existing 2011 Equity Plan
Approximately 631,216 shares remain available to be awarded under the 2011 Equity Plan. While being judicious in the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards and other equity awards, the amount of shares granted (as indicated in the chart below) can vary from year-to-year and, without the Amendment, the Company will be unduly limited in the structure of the awards that it may grant. Under New York Stock Exchange listing standards, shareholder approval is required for us to increase the authorized shares under the Plan.
The Company's burn rates for 2018 and the prior two years remain at reasonable levels:

[END TABLE]
1 On January 28, 2019, MDC's board of directors approved an 8% stock dividend that was distributed on February 28, 2019 to shareholders of record on February 14, 2019. In accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, share amounts have been restated for any periods or dates prior to the stock dividend record date.
Similarly, our existing dilution level remains reasonable. Following our February 2019 stock dividend, we have a total of 61,338,701 shares outstanding (as of the Record Date), a total of 1,213,340 shares available under our two equity plans and a total of 7,597,871 shares covered by outstanding options and performance share units under both equity plans, resulting in a dilution rate of 12.6%.  With an additional 2,000,000 shares authorized under the requested Amendment, the dilution rate would only modestly increase to 15.0%.  We calculate our existing "dilution" level as follows: "X" [shares available under our equity plans plus shares covered by outstanding options and performance share units] divided by "Y" [shares outstanding plus "X"].
Also, the proposed Amendment updates certain provisions of the current plan that reference, or relate to, Section 162(m) of the Code to comply with the recent elimination of the exception to the $1 million deductibility limit for "covered employees" under Section 162(m).
Accordingly, the Company recommends approval of the Amendment. 
Key Terms and Practices Under the 2011 Equity Plan
[BEGIN TABLE]
   No repricing of stock options without shareholder approval  
   Awards subject to clawback  
   No automatic single-trigger vesting in the event of a change in control  
[END TABLE]
Summary of Material Terms of the 2011 Equity Plan
The following discussion of the material features of the 2011 Equity Plan is qualified by reference to the full text of the plan, which was Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on April 29, 2011, as amended by the First Amendment, which was Exhibit 10.2 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on March 19, 2013, and as amended by the Second Amendment, which was Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on March 24, 2015, and as amended by the Third Amendment, which was Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Form 8-K filed on April 25, 2017.
Administration: The 2011 Equity Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee or any committee designated by our Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee or the Board may designate one or more subcommittees consisting of non-employee directors as defined in Rule 16b-3 under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and outside directors as defined in Treasury Regulation § 1.162-27(e)(3). The proposed Amendment would also provide that the Compensation Committee or the Board may in their discretion designate one or more subcommittees consisting of persons who are not described in the foregoing sentence. For purposes of this summary of the 2011 Equity Plan, the Compensation Committee or other designated committee will be referenced as the "Committee."
Subject to the terms and conditions of the 2011 Equity Plan, the Committee is authorized to select participants who are employees of the Company or its subsidiaries, determine the awards to be made, set terms and conditions of such awards, and determine the form of award agreements. The Committee also has the authority, among other things, to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• adopt rules and regulations relating to the 2011 Equity Plan;  
• correct any defect, supply any omission, or reconcile any inconsistency in the 2011 Equity Plan or any award agreement;  
• interpret the 2011 Equity Plan and award agreements; and  
• make all other determinations which may be necessary or desirable for the administration of the 2011 Equity Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Eligibility: Any employee of the Company or its subsidiaries is eligible to receive awards under the 2011 Equity Plan. There are four executive officers (including two employee directors) and approximately 1,550 non-executive officer employees who are eligible under the 2011 Equity Plan.
Shares Subject to the Plan: If the Amendment is approved by the shareholders, and subject to the adjustments upon changes in capitalization described below 9,568,478 shares of our common stock will be authorized for issuance of awards under the 2011 Equity Plan and the 9,568,478 shares of common stock also will be authorized for issuance pursuant to incentive stock options. As of the Record Date, there were approximately 631,216 shares available for (but not yet subject to) a grant or award, plus an additional 2,000,000 shares authorized by the Amendment (if the Amendment is approved by our shareholders). If our shareholders do not approve the Amendment, the 2011 Equity Plan's total authorized shares will remain at 7,568,478 shares, with a total remaining unused capacity of approximately 631,216 shares.
The maximum number or value of shares of common stock that may be granted to any individual under the 2011 Equity Plan in any calendar year shall not exceed the shares available for issuance under the plan, subject to the adjustments upon changes in capitalization described below. The shares underlying terminated awards and awards that are forfeited will remain available for issuance under the 2011 Equity Plan and shares that are utilized to pay an award's exercise price or tax withholding obligations will not count against the 2011 Equity Plan's share limits.
The closing price of a share of the Company's common stock as reflected on the New York Stock Exchange on the Record Date was $28.15.
Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights: The Committee is authorized to grant stock options, including both incentive stock options ("ISOs"), which can result in potentially favorable tax treatment to the participant, and non-qualified stock options ("NSOs"), and stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). The exercise price per share of common stock subject to an option or SAR must be at least the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant of a stock option or SAR; provided, however, that an ISO granted to a participant who is the holder of record of more than 10% of the Company's stock will have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant. The term of each option and SAR and the times at which each option or SAR shall be exercisable generally will be fixed by the Committee, except no option or SAR will have a term exceeding 10 years. Upon the termination of an option holder's or SAR holder's employment with us, the ability to exercise vested options and SARs will be determined in the discretion of the Committee as set forth in the applicable award agreement. Upon the termination of an option holder's or SAR holder's employment, all of that person's options and SARs will expire in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement; provided, however, that incentive stock options shall not be exercisable for more than three (3) months after the participant ceases to be an employee for any reason other than death or disability, or more than one (1) year after the participant ceases to be an employee due to death or disability. Options may be exercised by payment of the exercise price.
The exercise price of an NSO or ISO shall be payable to the Company in full, in any method permitted under the award agreement, including: (i) in cash or in cash equivalents acceptable to the Company; (ii) by tendering unrestricted shares of stock already owned by the participant (for at least six (6) months or such other period as may be required by the Committee in order to comply with applicable law and to avoid adverse accounting consequences) on the date of exercise to the extent the shares of stock have a fair market value on the date of exercise equal to the aggregate exercise price of the shares as to which such NSO or ISO shall be exercised, provided that, in the case of an ISO, the right to make payment in the form of already owned shares of stock may be authorized only at the time of grant, (iii) any other method approved or accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to a cashless (broker-assisted) exercise (although limitations might apply to certain executive officers), or (iv) any combination of the foregoing.
At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise of an SAR may be in cash, shares of stock or any combination thereof, or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee's determination as to the form of settlement will be set forth in the award agreement.
The exercise of an NSO or SAR is conditioned on the withholding of taxes.
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units: The Committee may grant shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units under the 2011 Equity Plan. The Committee determines in the award agreement the restriction period during which the restricted stock or the restricted stock units are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture based upon the passage of time, the achievement of performance goals or the occurrence of other events determined by the Committee. Except as provided in the 2011 Equity Plan or an award agreement, the restricted stock or the restricted stock units may not be sold, assigned or otherwise transferred until the end of the restriction period as specified by the Committee. The Committee may impose other conditions, including a requirement that the participant pay a specified amount to purchase each share of restricted stock, restrictions based upon the achievement of specific performance goals, time-based restrictions on vesting, or holding requirements or sale restrictions upon vesting. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, participants forfeit any unvested shares of restricted stock or restricted stock units upon termination of service. Participants holding restricted stock generally may vote the shares. The Committee may provide in an award agreement that the holder of restricted stock may receive any dividends paid. Participants holding shares of restricted stock units shall have no rights of stockholders. The Committee may provide in an award agreement that the holder of such restricted stock units shall be entitled to receive dividend equivalents.
Performance Awards: The Committee may condition any award under the 2011 Equity Plan on the fulfillment of conditions and the attainment of performance goals over such periods as the Committee determines in writing and sets forth in the award agreement between the Company and the participant. To the extent compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code is desired with respect to awards granted prior to November 2, 2017 (and not materially modified thereafter), which were intended to constitute performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) (such awards, "Grandfathered Awards"), the "Committee" for this purpose shall be comprised solely of two or more "outside directors" under Section 162(m). Performance goals for Grandfathered Awards would be established by the Committee within 90 days after the beginning of the applicable performance period, and in no event after passage of more than 25% of the period to which the performance goal relates. Performance goals are based on the attainment of specified target levels with respect to one or more selected measures of business or financial performance. Performance goals may include alternate and multiple goals and shall be based on one or more of the following criteria: (a) total shareholder return; (b) return on assets, return on equity, or return on capital employed; (c) measures of profitability such as earnings per share, corporate or business-unit net income, net income before extraordinary or one-time items, earnings before interest and taxes, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (d) cash flow from operations; (e) gross or net revenues or gross or net margins; (f) levels of operating expense or other expense items reported on the income statement; (g) measures of customer satisfaction and customer service; (h) safety; (i) annual or multi-year average production growth; (j) efficiency or productivity measures such as annual or multi-year absolute or per-unit operating and maintenance costs; (k) satisfactory completion of a major project or organizational initiative with specific criteria set in advance by the Committee; (l) debt ratios or other measures of credit quality or liquidity; (m) strategic asset sales or acquisitions in compliance with specific criteria set in advance by the Committee; (n) sales and marketing measures, such as annual or multi-year "net-back" sales or the introduction of new products in accordance with specific goals set in advance by the Committee; (o) staffing and retention and (p) any criteria that are stated in the stockholder approved Executive Officer Performance–Based Compensation Plan (as amended). The Amendment would amend criteria (p) to reference the 2013 Executive Officer Performance–Based Compensation Plan.
Following completion of the applicable performance period, the Committee certifies in writing the extent to which a participant has attained the applicable performance goals and the resulting value of the participant's award. The Committee retains the discretion to eliminate or reduce, but not increase, the amount that would otherwise be payable on a Grandfathered Award; however, no such reduction may increase the amount correspondingly paid to any other participant.
The proposed Amendment also clarifies that the Committee may in its discretion condition the grant, vesting or payment of an award on the attainment of pre-established performance goals which are not intended to qualify as "qualified performance based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code and which are not required to comply with the requirements of Section162(m) and Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 of the 2011 Equity Plan.
The Committee will, in the award agreement, state the results that will transpire if a participant terminates service due to death or disability prior to completion of the applicable performance period. For example, the final award value may be determined at the end of the performance period on the basis of the performance goals attained during the entire performance period, but will then be prorated for the number of months of the participant's service during the performance period. The Committee may also provide that, if a participant's service terminates prior to completion of the applicable performance period for any other reason, the participant forfeits the performance award, unless the Committee determines otherwise. Participants may not sell or transfer a performance award, other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, prior to the end of the applicable performance period. In the event that the performance goals are not satisfied, the award shall not become vested or payable, as applicable.
Other Stock-Based Awards: The Committee may adopt other incentive arrangements under which participants may acquire shares of stock by purchase, grant or otherwise, or receive an award payable in cash or stock, the value of which may be determined in whole or in part based on the value of the stock. Any such arrangements will be subject to the general provisions of the 2011 Equity Plan.
Adjustments Upon Changes in Capitalization: The 2011 Equity Plan provides that, in the event of any change in our capital structure that effects an increase or decrease in the number of shares of our common stock without receipt of consideration, the maximum number of shares of stock for which awards may be made under the plan shall be proportionately increased or decreased, and the number and kind of shares for which awards are outstanding may be proportionately increased or decreased. Any adjustment in outstanding options or SARs will not increase the aggregate exercise price or grant price payable with respect to shares that are subject to the unexercised portion of the option or SAR, in compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Except as otherwise provided in another agreement, upon a change of control the Committee may take any action it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any awards including, among other things, providing that the awards are fully vested or payable. In the event of a reorganization in which the Company is the surviving entity and no change of control occurs, any previous award will generally apply solely to securities to which the holder of the number of securities subject to such award would have been entitled immediately following such reorganization and, in the case of options or SARs, with a corresponding proportionate adjustment of the exercise price or grant price per share. Adjustments to shares of stock will be made by the Committee whose determination will be final and the Committee may provide in award agreements for different provisions to apply to an award. However, any provisions may be modified by the Committee to avoid any tax that would otherwise be due under Section 409A of the Code.
Substitute Awards: Awards may be granted in substitution for, or in assumption of, outstanding awards previously granted by an entity acquired by the Company or an affiliate or with which the Company or an affiliate combines.
Other Terms: The terms of the 2011 Equity Plan will permit the Committee to impose performance conditions with respect to any award. Performance conditions may require that an award be forfeited, in whole or in part, if performance objectives are not met, or require that the time of exercisability of an option be linked to achievement of performance conditions.
Each award agreement may contain other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the 2011 Equity Plan as may be determined by the Committee in its discretion. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee, no consideration is to be received by the Company for the granting of options or other awards.
No awards may be granted under the 2011 Equity Plan ten years after the date the plan is approved by the shareholders.
Our Board of Directors may terminate, amend or modify the 2011 Equity Plan; provided that no such termination, amendment or modification may adversely affect any outstanding award without the consent of the award holder. However, no amendment or modification may become effective without shareholder approval if required by applicable law or regulatory requirement. The listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange require that all equity compensation plans, and any material revisions to the plans, be subject to shareholder approval, with certain limited exemptions.
Awards granted under the 2011 Equity Plan generally are not transferrable other than upon death, in certain family transfers, or pursuant to a court-approved domestic relations order.
The 2011 Equity Plan will be governed by the laws of the state of Delaware except for conflict of law provisions.
Federal Tax Consequences of the 2011 Equity Plan 
The following is a general summary as of January 2019 of the federal income tax consequences to us and to U.S. participants to awards granted under the 2011 Equity Plan and does not attempt to describe all possible federal or other tax consequences of such participation or tax consequences based on particular circumstances. The federal tax laws may change and the federal, state and local tax consequences for any participant will depend upon his or her individual circumstances. Tax consequences for any particular individual may be different. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not discuss the tax consequences of a participant's death or provisions of income tax laws of any municipality, state or other country. Each participant is advised to consult his or her individual tax advisor concerning his or her personal tax consequences.
Incentive Stock Options: For federal income tax purposes, the holder of an ISO has no taxable income at the time of the grant or exercise of the ISO if certain requirements in the Code are satisfied, including the requirement that the holder generally must exercise the ISO no later than three months following termination of employment with the Company (or one year following a termination due to disability or death) and that common stock acquired upon exercise of the ISO is held for the requisite period described below. If such person retains the common stock for a period of at least two years after the stock option is granted and one year after the stock option is exercised, any gain upon the subsequent sale of the common stock will be taxed as a long term capital gain. A participant who disposes of shares acquired by exercise of an ISO prior to the expiration of two years after the stock option is granted or before one year after the stock option is exercised will recognize ordinary income or loss equal to the difference between the exercise price and fair market value of the stock as of the date of exercise. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be short or long term capital gain or loss depending on whether the shares had been held by the participant for more than one year. The difference between the option exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date of an ISO is an adjustment in computing the holder's alternative minimum taxable income and may be subject to an alternative minimum tax which is paid if such tax exceeds the participant's regular income tax for the year.
Non-statutory Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights: A participant who receives an NSO or SAR generally will not recognize taxable income on the grant of such option or SAR but will recognize ordinary income at the time of exercise of the stock option or SAR equal to the difference between the option or SAR exercise price and the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise. Any additional gain or loss recognized upon any later disposition of the shares would be short or long term capital gain or loss depending on whether the shares had been held by the participant for more than one year.
Restricted Stock: A participant acquiring restricted stock generally will recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares on the "determination date." The determination date is the date on which the participant acquires the shares unless the shares are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture and are not freely transferable, in which case the determination date is the earlier of (i) the date on which the shares become freely transferable or (ii) the date on which the shares are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. If the determination date is after the date on which the participant acquires the shares, the participant may elect, pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code, to have the date of acquisition be the determination date by filing an election with the Internal Revenue Service no later than 30 days after the date on which the shares are acquired. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. Upon the sale of shares acquired pursuant to a restricted stock award, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the determination date, will be taxed as capital gain or loss.
Restricted Stock Units: A participant generally will recognize no income upon the receipt of a restricted stock unit award. Upon the settlement of such an award, participants normally will recognize ordinary income in the year of receipt in an amount equal to the cash received and the fair market value of any substantially vested shares received. If the participant is an employee, such ordinary income generally is subject to withholding of income and employment taxes. If the participant receives shares of restricted stock, the participant generally will be taxed in the same manner as described under "Restricted Stock." Upon the sale of any shares received, any gain or loss, based on the difference between the sale price and the fair market value on the determination date (as defined under "Restricted Stock"), will be taxed as capital gain or loss.
Income Tax Effects for our Company: We generally will be entitled to a tax deduction in connection with an award under the 2011 Equity Plan in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by a participant at the time the participant recognizes such income (for example, upon the exercise of an NSO or the vesting of restricted stock), except to the extent such deduction is limited by applicable provisions of the Code.
Internal Revenue Code Section 409A: Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code governs the federal income taxation of certain types of nonqualified deferred compensation arrangements. A violation of section 409A generally results in an acceleration of the recognition of income of amounts intended to be deferred and the imposition of a federal excise tax of 20% on recipients of awards who are our employees over and above the income tax owed plus possible penalties and interest. The types of arrangements covered by section 409A are broad and may apply to certain awards available under the 2011 Equity Plan. As required by section 409A, certain nonqualified deferred compensation payments to specified employees may be delayed to the seventh month after such employee's separation from service.
New Plan Benefits
All awards under the 2011 Equity Plan will be granted at the Committee's discretion. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the 2011 Equity Plan are not presently determinable.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The following Report of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed to be "filed" with the SEC or to be subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP ("independent auditors"), is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and for issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee generally meets monthly, or more often as necessary, to fulfill its responsibility to monitor and oversee these processes, as described in the Audit Committee Charter.
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018 with the Company's management, the independent auditors and the Company's internal audit department. The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding independent auditors' communications with audit committees concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditors their independence status.
Based on the review and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
The Company leases its headquarters office space at 4350 S. Monaco Street, Denver CO 80237. Approximately 5,437 square feet in the Company's office building at 4350 S. Monaco Street is subleased by an entity affiliated with Mr. Mizel, for which it paid rent in 2018 to the Company of $149,952.
During 2018, the Company paid a firm owned by Carol Mizel, Mr. Mizel's spouse, $120,000 for consulting services in connection with corporate and consumer marketing, merchandising, design work, human resources development, product development, and such other matters as were requested by the Company's senior management. The firm, Mizel Design and Decorating Company, provided these services under an Independent Contractor Agreement with the Company, dated as of January 1, 2005. The Company also provides Ms. Mizel with office space in the Company's office building at 4350 S. Monaco Street, which has an estimated annual rental value of approximately $7,500.
Effective as of January 1, 2005, and August 2, 2007, Larry A. Mizel, Chief Executive Officer, and David D. Mandarich, President and Chief Operating Officer, each entered into lease agreements for their non-business use of Company aircraft when the aircraft is not required for Company business. The lease agreements require payment of the Incremental Expenses incurred by the Company for each non-business use, as defined in the lease agreements. The Incremental Expenses represent the maximum reimbursement permitted by the Federal Aviation Administration in Federal Aviation Regulation Part 91.501(d). The executive officers also pay the federal excise tax for the non-business use of the aircraft. Copies of the lease agreements have been filed with the SEC on Form 8-K and Form 10-Q. For their non-business use of the aircraft in 2018, Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich reimbursed the Company for Incremental Expenses of $310,000 and $37,000.
As noted above under Election of Directors, Director Courtney L. Mizel is the daughter of the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Larry A. Mizel.
REVIEW OF TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
Our policies require that full information be disclosed regarding transactions with related persons, without mandating how such transactions are to be addressed, so that they may be considered on their own merits. Specifically, our Corporate Code of Conduct, in addressing conflicts of interest, notes that personal interests of our employees and Directors and their family members could come into conflict, or create the appearance of a conflict, with the Company's interest. Accordingly, the Code of Conduct requires all employees (including our executive officers) and our Directors to immediately report conflicts of interest or transactions that could create the appearance of a conflict of interest. These reports are to be made immediately to a Company compliance officer (as identified in the Code of Conduct), the Company's Asset Management Committees, or, for members of the Company's Board of Directors, to the Audit Committee, for a determination as to compliance with the Code of Conduct.
In addition, the Audit Committee's charter provides for the Committee to be informed of related party transactions. In support of this and the Company's SEC reporting requirements, the following written procedure has been adopted. Specifically, the Directors and executive officers are to report to the Company's legal department all related party transactions between the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) and any of the executive officers and Directors, including any of their family members, which is reported on a monthly basis to the Audit Committee. Also, our CFO reports on a monthly basis to the Audit Committee as to the best of the CFO's, CEO's, and COO's knowledge, whether or not any related party transactions have occurred.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
The Company's executive officers and Directors and certain beneficial owners of more than ten percent of the Company's common stock are required under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock of the Company with the SEC and furnish copies of those reports to the Company. Based solely upon a review of the copies of reports furnished to the Company and, in certain cases, written representations, the Company believes that during the year ended December 31, 2018, all such reports were filed on a timely basis, except for a Form 4 report filed late for each of Messrs. Mizel and Mandarich with respect to one transaction and a Form 4 report filed late for Mr. Siegel with respect to one transaction.

OTHER MATTERS
Management and the Board of Directors of the Company know of no matters to be brought before the Meeting other than the proposals set forth above. If you grant a proxy, each of the persons named as proxy holder, Michael Touff and Joseph H. Fretz, or their nominees or substitutes, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Meeting. If for any unforeseen reason, any of our nominees are not available as a candidate for Director, the proxy holder may vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates nominated by our Board.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
Any proposal a shareholder desires to present at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and to have included in the Company's proxy soliciting materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, must be received in writing by the Secretary of the Company not later than Saturday, November 9, 2019.  However, if the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting changes by more than 30 days from the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, then the deadline is a reasonable time before the Company begins to print and mail its proxy materials as the Company shall inform the shareholders. 
For shareholder proposals submitted outside the Rule 14a-8 process, the Company's By-Laws provide that only business properly brought before a meeting will be conducted. For business to be properly brought before a meeting by a shareholder, the shareholder must give timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Company. To be timely, the notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Company not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the meeting; however, in the event that less than 75 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of such meeting is given or made to shareholders, notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made. A shareholder's notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting, (ii) the name and record address of the shareholder proposing such business, (iii) the class and number of shares of the Company which are beneficially owned by the shareholder and (iv) any material interest of the shareholder in such business.
If notice of a proposal is not submitted in writing and received by the Company at the address appearing on the first page of this proxy statement by the dates described above, then the proposal will be deemed untimely under Rule 14a-4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the persons appointed as the Company's proxies will have the right to exercise discretionary voting authority with respect to the proposal.

[END TABLE]
1.1     Establishment. M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), hereby establishes the M.D.C. Holdings, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"). The Plan permits the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, and other stock-based and cash awards in accordance with the terms hereof.

[END TABLE]
3.1      General.      The Plan shall be administered by the Committee, which shall have full power and authority to take all actions and to make all determinations as are required or permitted under the Plan. In accordance with the provisions of the Plan, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, select the Participants from among the eligible individuals described in Section 5, determine the Awards to be made pursuant to the Plan, or shares of Stock to be issued thereunder and the time at which such Awards are to be made, fix the Option Price (or Grant Price), period and manner in which an Option (or Stock Appreciation Right) becomes exercisable, establish the duration and nature of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit restrictions, establish the terms and conditions applicable to, and establish such other terms and requirements of the various compensation incentives under the Plan as the Committee may deem necessary or desirable and consistent with the terms of the Plan. The Committee shall determine the form of the Award Agreements with Participants that shall evidence the particular provisions, terms, conditions, rights and duties of the Company and the Participants with respect to Awards granted pursuant to the Plan, which provisions need not be identical except as may be provided herein. The Committee may amend, modify, or supplement the terms of any outstanding Award including, but not limited to, amending an Award or exercising discretion under an Award or under the Plan to: (i) accelerate the date on which an Award becomes vested, exercisable, or transferable, (ii) extend the term of any Award, including the period following the termination of the Participant's Service to the Company during which the Award shall remain outstanding, (iii) waive any conditions with regard to vesting, exercisability, or transferability of an Award, and (iv) recognize differences in local law, tax policy, or custom with regard to Awards made to foreign nations or individuals who are employed outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or modification may be made to an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right that (i) causes the Option or Stock Appreciation Right to become subject to Section 409A of the Code, (ii) reduces the Exercise Price or Grant Price, either by lowering the Exercise Price or Grant Price or by canceling the outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right and granting a replacement Option or Stock Appreciation Right with a lower Exercise Price or Grant Price, or (iii) would be treated as a repricing under the rules of the exchange upon which shares of Stock of the Company trade, without, with respect to item (i), the Participant's written prior approval, and with respect to items (ii) and (iii), without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, provided, that appropriate adjustments may be made to outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to Section 14.
As a condition to any Award, the Committee shall have the right, at its discretion, to require Participants to return to the Company Awards previously granted under the Plan. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, any such subsequent Award shall be upon such terms and conditions as are specified by the Committee at the time the new Award is granted. The Company may retain the right in an Award Agreement to cause a forfeiture of the gain realized by a Participant on account of actions taken by the Participant in violation or breach of or in conflict with any non-competition agreement, any agreement prohibiting solicitation of employees or clients of the Company or any Affiliate thereof or any confidentiality obligation with respect to the Company or any Affiliate thereof or otherwise in competition with the Company or any Affiliate thereof, to the extent specified in such Award Agreement applicable to the Participant. Furthermore, the Committee may annul an Award if the Participant is an employee of the Company or an Affiliate thereof and is terminated for Cause as defined in the applicable Award Agreement or the Plan, as applicable.
The Committee may from time to time adopt such rules and regulations for carrying out the purposes of the Plan as it may deem proper and in the best interests of the Company. The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or in any Award Agreement entered into hereunder in the manner and to the extent it shall deem expedient and it shall be the sole and final judge of such expediency. The determinations, interpretations and other actions of the Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Plan shall be binding and conclusive for all purposes and on all persons.
3.2     Delegation by the Committee. The Committee may, from time to time, delegate, to specified officers of the Company, the power and authority to grant or document Awards under the Plan to specified groups of eligible individuals, subject to such restrictions and conditions as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose. The delegation shall be as broad or as narrow as the Committee shall determine. To the extent that the Committee has delegated the authority to determine certain terms and conditions of an Award, all references in the Plan to the Committee's exercise of authority in determining such terms and conditions shall be construed to include the officer or officers to whom the Committee has delegated the power and authority to make such determination. However, any delegation (a) shall not result in the loss of an exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) for Awards granted to Participants subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act in respect of the Company, and there shall be no delegation of authority to grant awards to any Section 16 person, (b) will not cause Awards intended to qualify as "performance-based" compensation under Code Section 162(m) to fail to so qualify, (c) will not result in a related-person transaction with an executive officer required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K (in accordance with Instruction 5.a.ii thereunder) under the Exchange Act and (d) shall be permitted under Section 157 and other applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

3.4     Deferral Arrangement. The Committee may permit or require the deferral of any Award payment into a deferred compensation arrangement, subject to such rules and procedures as it may establish in accordance with Section 409A of the Code, which may include provisions for the payment or crediting of interest or Dividend Equivalents, including converting such credits into deferred Stock units.
3.5     No Liability. No member of the Board or of the Committee shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan, any Award or any Award Agreement.
3.6     Book Entry.

4.3     Share Counting.  The Committee may adopt reasonable counting procedures to ensure appropriate counting, avoid double counting (as, for example, in the case of tandem Awards) and make adjustments in accordance with Section 14. If the Exercise Price of any Option granted under the Plan, or if pursuant to Section 12 the tax withholding obligation of any Participant with respect to an Option or other Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Stock to the Company or by withholding shares of Stock, the number of shares of Stock issued net of the shares of Stock tendered or withheld shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Stock available for delivery under the Plan. To the extent that an Award under the Plan is canceled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash, settled by issuance of fewer shares than the number underlying the Award, or otherwise terminated without delivery of shares to the Participant, the shares of Stock retained or returned to the Company will also be available under the Plan.

6.7          Family Transfers. If authorized in the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant may transfer, not for value, all or part of an Option to any Family Member.

6.8         Rights of Holders of Options. Unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, an individual holding or exercising an Option shall have none of the rights of a stockholder of the Company (for example, the right to receive cash or dividend payments or distributions attributable to the subject shares of Stock or to direct the voting of the shares of Stock) until the shares of Stock covered thereby are fully paid and issued to such individual. Except as provided in Section 14 hereof, no adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for which the record date is prior to the date of such issuance.

 7   STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS  
[END TABLE]
7.1         Grant of Stock Appreciation Rights. Subject to the provisions of this Plan, Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee may grant freestanding Stock Appreciation Rights, Stock Appreciation Rights that are granted in tandem with an Option, or any combination thereof.
7.2         Award Agreement. Each Stock Appreciation Right shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Grant Price, the number of shares of Stock covered by the Stock Appreciation Right, the maximum duration of the Stock Appreciation Right, the conditions upon which the Stock Appreciation Right shall become vested and exercisable and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine, consistent with the terms of the Plan.
(a)       Grant Price. The Grant Price for each Stock Appreciation Right shall be determined by the Committee and shall be specified in the Award Agreement. Other than with respect to Substitute Awards, the Grant Price shall not be less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Grant Date of the Stock Appreciation Right.
(b)       Number of Shares. Each Award Agreement shall state that it covers a specified number of shares of Stock, as determined by the Committee.
(c)       Term. Each Stock Appreciation Right shall terminate and all rights with respect to the Stock Appreciation Right shall expire at such time as the Committee shall determine at the time of grant; provided, however, no Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Grant Date.
(d)       Restrictions on Exercise. The Award Agreement shall set forth any installment or other restrictions on exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right during its term. Each Stock Appreciation Right shall become exercisable and shall vest over such period of time, or upon such events, as determined by the Committee (including based on achievement of performance goals or future service requirements).
7.3        Exercise of Stock Appreciation Right. A Participant desiring to exercise a Stock Appreciation Right shall give written or electronic notice, on a form provided by the Company, of such exercise to the Company with the information the Company deems reasonably necessary to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right. If a Stock Appreciation Right is issued in tandem with an Option, except as may otherwise be provided by the Committee, the Stock Appreciation Right shall be exercisable during the period that its related Option is exercisable. Upon the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying:
(a)       The excess of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the date of exercise over the Grant Price; by
(b)       The number of shares of Stock with respect to which the Stock Appreciation Right is exercised.
At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon exercise may be in cash, shares of Stock or any combination thereof, or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee's determination as to the form of settlement shall be set forth in the Award Agreement.
7.4        Effect of Exercise. If a Stock Appreciation Right is issued in tandem with an Option, the exercise of the Stock Appreciation Right or the related Option will result in an equal reduction in the number of corresponding shares of Stock subject to the Option or Stock Appreciation Right that were granted in tandem with such Stock Appreciation Right and Option.
7.5        Termination of Service. Each Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to exercise the Stock Appreciation Right following termination of the Participant's Service. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, need not be uniform among all Stock Appreciation Rights issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination of Service. Any Stock Appreciation Right issued in tandem with an Option shall be exercisable following termination of the Participant's Service to the same extent that its related Option is exercisable following the Participant's termination of Service.
7.6        Transferability. A Stock Appreciation Right shall only be transferable upon the same terms and conditions with respect to transferability as are specified in Sections 6.6 and 6.7 with respect to Options.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 8   RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS  
[END TABLE]
8.1        Grant of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units. Subject to the provisions of this Plan, the Committee at any time and from time to time, may grant shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units to Participants in such amounts as the Committee shall determine.
8.2        Award Agreement. Each grant of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Restriction Period, the number of shares of Restricted Stock or the number of Restricted Stock Units granted and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine.
8.3        Restrictions on Transfer. Except as provided in this Plan or an Award Agreement, the shares of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until the end of the Restriction Period established by the Committee and specified in the Award Agreement (and in the case of Restricted Stock Units until the date of delivery or other payment), or upon earlier satisfaction or any other conditions, as specified by the Committee, in its sole discretion. All rights with respect to the Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units granted to a Participant shall be available during his or her lifetime only to such Participant, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or at any time by the Committee.
8.4        Forfeiture; Other Restrictions. The Committee shall impose such other conditions and restrictions on any shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units as it may deem advisable including a requirement that the Participant pay a specified amount to purchase each share of Restricted Stock, restrictions based upon the achievement of specific performance goals, time-based restrictions on vesting following the attainment of the performance goals, time-based restrictions or restrictions under applicable laws or under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which shares of Stock are then listed or traded, or holding requirements or sale restrictions placed on the shares of Stock by the Company upon vesting of such Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
8.5       Restricted Stock Units. A holder of Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights other than those of a general creditor of the Company. Restricted Stock Units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Award Agreement. Restricted Stock Units may be settled in cash or Stock, as determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement.
8.6        Termination of Service. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee in the applicable Award Agreement, upon the termination of a Participant's Service with the Company or an Affiliate, any shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units held by such Participant that have not vested, or with respect to which all applicable restrictions and conditions have not lapsed, shall immediately be deemed forfeited, and the Participant shall have no further rights with respect to such Awards, including but not limited to any right to vote Restricted Stock or any right to receive dividends or Dividend Equivalents with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units.
8.7          Stockholder Privileges. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee and set forth in the Award Agreement:
(a)       A Participant holding shares of Restricted Stock shall generally have the rights of stockholder to vote the shares or Restricted Stock during the Restriction Period. The Committee may provide in an Award Agreement that the holder of such Restricted Stock shall be entitled to receive ordinary cash dividends actually paid with respect to the Restricted Stock in accordance with Section 11.
(b)       A Participant holding Restricted Stock Units shall have no rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to the Restricted Stock Units. The Committee may provide in an Award Agreement that the holder of such Restricted Stock Units shall be entitled to receive Dividend Equivalents in accordance with Section 11.

 9   QUALIFIED PERFORMANCE BASED COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
9.1        Grant or Vesting of Award Subject to Objective Performance Goals. The Committee may, in its discretion, condition the grant, vesting, or payment of an Award on the attainment of one or more pre-established objective performance goals, in accordance with the "qualified performance based compensation" exception to Code Section 162(m) and the requirements of Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 of this Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the Committee may also, in its discretion, condition the grant, vesting, or payment of an Award on the attainment of one or more pre-established objective performance goals which are not intended to qualify for the "qualified performance based compensation" exception to Code Section 162(m) and which are not required to comply with the requirements of Sections 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 of this Plan.
9.2        Establishment of Performance Goals. All performance goals established pursuant to this Article 9 shall be objective and shall be established by the Committee within 90 days after the beginning of the period of service to which the performance goal relates (and in no event after passage of more than 25% of the period to which the performance goal relates). Performance goals may include alternate and multiple goals and shall be based on one or more of the following criteria: (a) total shareholder return; (b) return on assets, return on equity, or return on capital employed; (c) measures of profitability such as earnings per share, corporate or business-unit net income, net income before extraordinary or one-time items, earnings before interest and taxes, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; (d) cash flow from operations; (e) gross or net revenues or gross or net margins; (f) levels of operating expense or other expense items reported on the income statement; (g) measures of customer satisfaction and customer service; (h) safety; (i) annual or multi-year average production growth; (j) efficiency or productivity measures such as annual or multi-year absolute or per-unit operating and maintenance costs; (k) satisfactory completion of a major project or organizational initiative with specific criteria set in advance by the Committee; (l) debt ratios or other measures of credit quality or liquidity; (m) strategic asset sales or acquisitions in compliance with specific criteria set in advance by the Committee; (n) sales and marketing measures, such as annual or multi-year "net-back" sales or the introduction of new products in accordance with specific goals set in advance by the Committee; (o) staffing and retention and (p) any criteria stated in the stockholder approved 2013 Executive Officer Performance–Based Compensation Plan (as amended). The performance goals applicable to a particular Award shall be set forth by the Committee in the Award Agreement for such Award.
9.3         Achievement of Performance Goals. The Committee shall certify in writing prior to the grant, vesting, or payment of any Award that the applicable performance goals have been satisfied. Except as may otherwise be provided herein or as may otherwise be contained in the Award Agreement (which provisions shall comply with Section 162(m)), in the event that the performance goals are not satisfied, the Award shall not be granted or become vested or payable, as applicable.
9.4        Committee to Comply with Section 162(m). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the "Committee," for purposes of this Section 9, shall consist solely of two or more persons who qualify as "outside directors" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 10   OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS  
[END TABLE]
From time to time during the duration of this Plan, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, adopt one or more incentive compensation arrangements for Participants pursuant to which the Participants may (i) acquire shares of Stock under the Plan, whether by purchase, outright grant, or otherwise, or (ii) receive an Award, whether payable in cash or in Stock, the value of which is determined, in whole or in part, based on the value of Common Stock. Any such arrangements shall be subject to the general provisions of this Plan and all cash payments or shares of Stock issued pursuant to such arrangements shall be made under this Plan.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 11   DIVIDENDS AND DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS  
[END TABLE]
Subject to the terms of the Plan and any applicable Award Agreement, a Participant shall, if so determined by the Committee, be entitled to receive, currently, or on a deferred basis, dividends or Dividend Equivalents, with respect to the shares of Stock covered by the Award. The Committee may provide that any dividends paid on shares of Stock subject to an Award must be reinvested in additional shares of Stock, which may or may not be subject to the same vesting conditions and restrictions applicable to the Award. Notwithstanding the award of Dividend Equivalents or dividends, a Participant shall not be entitled to receive a special or extraordinary dividend or distribution unless the Committee shall have expressly authorized such receipt. All distributions, if any, received by a Participant with respect to an Award as a result of any split, Stock dividend, combination of shares of Stock, or other similar transaction shall be subject to the restrictions applicable to the original Award.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 12   TAX WITHHOLDING   
[END TABLE]
The Company or any Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to a Participant any federal, state, or local taxes, domestic or foreign, of any kind required by law with respect to the vesting of or other lapse of restrictions applicable to Awards or upon the issuance of any shares of Stock or payment of any kind upon the exercise of any Options or Stock Appreciation Rights. At the time of such vesting, lapse, payment, or exercise, the Participant shall pay to the Company or Affiliate, as the case may be, any amount that the Company or Affiliate may reasonably determine to be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation.
Subject to the prior approval of the Company or the Affiliate, which may be withheld by the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, in its sole discretion, the Participant may elect to have shares of Stock withheld or to deliver shares to satisfy the minimum statutory withholding rates for federal, state and local income taxes and employment taxes that are applicable to supplemental taxable income ("Minimum Statutory Withholding") obligations. The Participant may elect to satisfy Minimum Statutory Withholding obligations, in whole or in part, (i) by causing the Company or the Affiliate to withhold shares of Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant or (ii) by delivering to the Company or the Affiliate shares of Stock already owned by the Participant (for at least six (6) months or such other period as may be required by the Committee in order to comply with applicable law and to avoid adverse accounting consequences). The shares of Stock so delivered or withheld shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value not in excess of such withholding obligations. The Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock used to satisfy such withholding obligation shall be determined by the Committee as of the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. A Participant who has made an election pursuant to this Section 12 may satisfy his or her withholding obligation only with shares of Stock that are not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting, or other similar requirements.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 13   PARACHUTE LIMITATIONS   
[END TABLE]
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or of any other agreement, contract, or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by a Participant with the Company or any Affiliate, except an agreement, contract, or understanding that expressly or impliedly modifies or excludes application of this Section 13 (an "Other Agreement"), and notwithstanding any formal or informal plan or other arrangement for the direct or indirect provision of compensation to the Participant (including groups or classes of participants or beneficiaries of which the Participant is a member), whether or not such compensation is deferred, is in cash, or is in the form of a benefit to or for the Participant (a "Benefit Arrangement"), if the Participant is a "disqualified individual," as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code, any Awards held by that Participant and any right to receive any payment or other benefit under this Plan shall not become exercisable or vested (i) to the extent that such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit, taking into account all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the Participant under this Plan, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements, would cause any payment or benefit to the Participant under this Plan to be considered a "parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code as then in effect (a "Parachute Payment") and (ii) if, as a result of receiving a Parachute Payment, the aggregate after-tax amounts received by the Participant from the Company under this Plan, all Other Agreements, and all Benefit Arrangements would be less than the maximum after-tax amount that could be received by the Participant without causing any such payment or benefit to be considered a Parachute Payment. In the event that the receipt of any such right to exercise, vesting, payment, or benefit under this Plan, in conjunction with all other rights, payments, or benefits to or for the Participant under any Other Agreement or any Benefit Arrangement would cause the Participant to be considered to have received a Parachute Payment under this Plan that would have the effect of decreasing the after-tax amount received by the Participant as described in clause (ii) of the preceding sentence, then the Committee shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to designate those rights, payments, or benefits under this Plan, any Other Agreements, and any Benefit Arrangements to be reduced or eliminated so as to avoid having the payment or benefit to the Participant under this Plan be deemed to be a Parachute Payment.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 14   EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION   
[END TABLE]
14.1       Changes in Stock. The maximum number of shares of Stock for which Awards may be made under the Plan as set forth in Section 4.1 shall be proportionately increased or decreased for any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Stock on account of any recapitalization, reclassification, split, reverse split, combination, exchange, dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Stock, or for any other increase or decrease in such shares of Stock effected without receipt of consideration by the Company occurring after the Effective Date (any such event hereafter referred to as a "Corporate Event"). In addition, subject to the exception set forth in the second sentence of Section 14.4, the number and kind of shares for which Awards are outstanding shall be proportionately increased or decreased for any increase or decrease in the number of shares of Stock on account of any Corporate Event. Any such adjustment in outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall not increase the aggregate Exercise Price or Grant Price payable with respect to shares that are subject to the unexercised portion of an outstanding Option or Stock Appreciation Right, as applicable, and the adjustment shall comply with the requirements under Section 409A of the Code. The conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be treated as an increase in shares effected without receipt of consideration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any distribution to the Company's stockholders of securities of any other entity or other assets (including an extraordinary cash dividend but excluding a non-extraordinary dividend payable in cash or in stock of the Company) without receipt of consideration by the Company, the Company shall proportionately adjust (i) the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards and/or (ii) the Exercise Price per share of outstanding Options and the Grant Price of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights to reflect such distribution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of any event or transaction contemplated in this Section 14.1, any changes contemplated herein shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to avoid any tax that may otherwise become due under Section 409A of the Code.
14.2       Change of Control. Subject to the exception set forth in the second sentence of Section 14.4, and except as otherwise provided in any other agreement, contract, or understanding heretofore or hereafter entered into by a Participant with the Company or any Affiliate, upon a Change of Control, the Committee in its discretion may take any of the following actions with respect to non-vested Awards as of the date of the Change of Control: (i) provide that any or all such outstanding Awards shall be fully vested, exercisable, and/or payable regardless of whether all vesting conditions relating to length of service, attainment of performance goals, or otherwise have been satisfied; (ii) provide that any or all such outstanding Awards shall become fully vested, exercisable, and/or payable if, within a reasonable period of time not to exceed 18 months after the consummation of a Change of Control, a Participant's Service is terminated by either the Company, an Affiliate or a successor in interest to the Company or an Affiliate without Cause or by the Participant for Good Reason; or (iii) take such further actions, if any, as it deems necessary or desirable with respect to any Awards, including, without limitation, providing that such Awards are fully vested, exercisable and/or payable. The Committee need not take the same action with respect to all outstanding Awards or to all outstanding Awards of the same type.
14.3       Reorganization in Which the Company Is the Surviving Entity and in Which No Change of Control Occurs. Subject to the exception set forth in the second sentence of Section 14.4, if the Company shall be the surviving entity in any reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the Company with one or more other entities and in which no Change of Control occurs, any Award theretofore made pursuant to the Plan shall pertain to and apply solely to the securities to which a holder of the number of securities subject to such Award would have been entitled immediately following such reorganization, merger, or consolidation, and, in the case of Options and Stock Appreciation Rights, with a corresponding proportionate adjustment of the Exercise Price or Grant Price per share so that the aggregate Exercise Price or Grant Price thereafter shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price or Grant Price of the shares of Stock remaining subject to the Option or Stock Appreciation Right immediately prior to such reorganization, merger, or consolidation. Subject to any contrary language in an Award Agreement evidencing any other Award, any restrictions applicable to such Award shall apply as well to any replacement shares of Stock received by the Participant as a result of the reorganization, merger or consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of any event or transaction contemplated in this Section 14.3, any changes contemplated herein shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to avoid any tax that may otherwise become due under Section 409A of the Code.
14.4       Adjustment. Adjustments under Section 14 related to shares of Stock or securities of the Company shall be made by the Committee, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. The Committee may provide in the Award Agreements at the time of Award, or any time thereafter with the consent of the Participant, for different provisions to apply to an Award in place of those described in Sections 14.1, 14.2 and 14.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any different provisions or changes to provisions contemplated herein shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary, in the sole discretion of the Committee, to avoid any tax that may otherwise become due under Section 409A of the Code.
14.5       No Limitations on the Company. The making of Awards pursuant to the Plan shall not affect or limit in any way the right or power of the Company to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, or liquidate, or to sell or transfer all or any part of its business or assets.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 15   REQUIREMENTS OF LAW  
[END TABLE]
15.1       General. The Company shall not be required to issue or sell any shares of Stock under any Award if the issuance or sale of such shares would constitute a violation by the Participant, any other individual exercising an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, or the Company of any provisions of any law or regulation of any governmental authority, including without limitation any federal or state securities laws or regulations. If at any time the Company shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of any shares subject to an Award upon any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or purchase of shares of Stock hereunder, no shares of Stock may be issued or sold to the Participant or any other individual exercising an Option or Stock Appreciation Right pursuant to such Award unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company, and any delay caused thereby shall in no way affect the date of termination of the Award. Specifically, in connection with the Securities Act, upon the exercise of any Option or the delivery of any shares of Stock underlying an Award, unless a registration statement under the Securities Act is in effect with respect to the shares of Stock covered by such Award, the Company shall not be required to issue or sell such shares of Stock unless the Committee has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Participant or any other individual exercising an Option may acquire such shares of Stock pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Any determination in this connection by the Committee shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The Company may, but shall in no event be obligated to, register any securities covered hereby pursuant to the Securities Act. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an Option or the issuance or sale of shares of Stock pursuant to the Plan to comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority. As to any jurisdiction that expressly imposes the requirement that an Option shall not be exercisable until the shares of Stock covered by such Option are registered or are exempt from registration, the exercise of such Option (under circumstances in which the laws of such jurisdiction apply) shall be deemed conditioned upon the effectiveness of such registration or the availability of such an exemption.
15.2        Rule 16b-3. During any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that Awards pursuant to the Plan and the exercise of Options granted hereunder will qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent that any provision of the Plan or action by the Committee does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Committee, and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event that Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Committee may exercise its discretion to modify this Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of, or to take advantage of any features of, the revised exemption or its replacement.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
 16   GENERAL PROVISIONS  
[END TABLE]
16.1        Disclaimer of Rights. No provision in the Plan, in any Award or in any Award Agreement shall be construed to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Company either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any individual at any time, or to terminate any employment or other relationship between any individual and the Company or any Affiliate. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described herein, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed herein. The Plan shall in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any participant or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan.
16.2        Nontransferability of Awards. Except as provided in Sections 6.6, 6.7, and 7.6 or otherwise at the time of grant or thereafter, no right or interest of any Participant in an Award granted pursuant to the Plan shall be assignable or transferable during the lifetime of the Participant, either voluntarily or involuntarily, or subjected to any lien, directly or indirectly, by operation of law, or otherwise, including execution, levy, garnishment, attachment, pledge or bankruptcy, except pursuant to a domestic relations order in settlement of marital property rights. In the event of a Participant's death, a Participant's rights and interests in Awards shall only be transferable by will or the laws of descent and distribution to the extent provided under this Plan, and payment of any amounts due thereunder shall be made to, and exercise of any Option or Stock Appreciation Right may be made by, the Participant's legal representatives, heirs or legatees. If in the opinion of the Committee a person entitled to payments or to exercise rights with respect to the Plan is unable to care for his or her affairs because of mental condition, physical condition or age, payment due such person may be made to, and such rights shall be exercised by, such person's guardian, conservator or other legal personal representative upon furnishing the Committee with evidence satisfactory to the Committee of such status.
16.3        Changes in Accounting or Tax Rules. Except as provided otherwise at the time an Award is granted, notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if, during the term of the Plan, any changes in the financial or tax accounting rules applicable to any Award shall occur which, in the sole judgment of the Committee, may have a material adverse effect on the reported earnings, assets or liabilities of the Company, the Committee shall have the right and power to modify as necessary, any then outstanding and unexercised Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and other outstanding Awards as to which the applicable rules or other restrictions have not been satisfied.
16.4        Nonexclusivity of the Plan. The adoption of the Plan shall not be construed as creating any limitations upon the right and authority of the Committee to adopt such other incentive compensation arrangements (which arrangements may be applicable either generally to a class or classes of individuals or specifically to a particular individual or particular individuals) as the Committee in its discretion determines desirable.
16.5        Captions. The use of captions in this Plan or any Award Agreement is for the convenience of reference only and shall not affect the meaning of any provision of the Plan or such Award Agreement.
16.6        Other Award Agreement Provisions. Each Award Agreement may contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.
16.7        Other Employee Benefits. The amount of any compensation deemed to be received by a Participant as a result of the exercise of an Option or Stock Appreciation Right, the sale of Shares received upon such exercise, the vesting of any Restricted Stock, distributions with respect to Restricted Stock Units, or Other Stock-Based Awards shall not constitute "earnings" or "compensation" with respect to which any other employee benefits of such employee are determined, including without limitation, benefits under any pension, profit sharing, 401(k), life insurance or salary continuation plan, except as may be specifically be provided otherwise under the terms of such other employee benefit plan or program.
16.8        Severability. If any provision of the Plan or any Award Agreement shall be determined to be illegal or unenforceable by any court of law in any jurisdiction, the remaining provisions hereof and thereof shall be severable and enforceable in accordance with their terms, and all provisions shall remain enforceable in any other jurisdiction.
16.9       Governing Law. The validity and construction of this Plan and the Award Agreements shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware other than any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Plan and the Award Agreements to the substantive laws of any other jurisdiction.
16.10      Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, the Plan and Awards made under the Plan are intended to comply with the requirements imposed by Section 409A of the Code. If any Plan provision or Award under the Plan would result in the imposition of an additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the Company and the Participant intend that the Plan provision or Award will be reformed to avoid imposition, to the extent possible, of the applicable tax and no action taken to comply with Section 409A of the Code shall be deemed to adversely affect the Participant's rights to an Award. The Participant further agrees that the Committee, in the exercise of its sole discretion and without the consent of the Participant, may amend or modify an Award in any manner and delay the payment of any amounts payable pursuant to an Award to the minimum extent necessary to meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code as the Committee deems appropriate or desirable. Subject to any other restrictions or limitations contained herein, in the event that a "specified employee" (as defined under Section 409A of the Code) becomes entitled to a payment under the Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code on account of a "separation of service" (as defined under Section 409A oft the Code), such payment shall not occur until the date that is six months plus one day from the date of such "separation from service." Any amount that is otherwise payable within the six (6) month period described herein will be aggregated and paid in a lump sum amount without interest.

 17   AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION  
[END TABLE]
17.1        Amendment, Modification, and Termination. Subject to Sections 3.2, 16.10 and 17.2, the Board may at any time terminate, and from time to time may amend or modify the Plan provided, however, that no amendment or modification may become effective without approval of the stockholders of the Company if stockholder approval is required to enable the Plan to satisfy any applicable statutory or regulatory requirements, or if the Company, on the advice of counsel, determines that stockholder approval is otherwise necessary or desirable.
17.2        Awards Previously Granted. Except as otherwise may be required under Section 16.10, notwithstanding Section 17.1 to the contrary, no amendment, modification or termination of the Plan or Award Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way any previously granted Award, without the written consent of the Participant holding such Award.
