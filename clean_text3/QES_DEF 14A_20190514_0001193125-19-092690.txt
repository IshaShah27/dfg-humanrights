About the Annual Meeting 
When and where is the Annual Meeting? 
The Annual Meeting will be a completely virtual meeting. There will be no physical meeting location and the meeting will only be conducted via live webcast. The virtual Annual Meeting will be held on Tuesday, May 14, 2019 at 9:00 A.M., Central Daylight Time. To participate in the Annual Meeting and submit questions during the Annual Meeting, visit www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/qes2019 and, in each case, enter the 16-digit control number included in your Notice of Internet Availability, on the proxy card you received, or in the instructions that accompanied your proxy materials. Online check-in will begin at 8:45 A.M., Central Daylight Time. Please allow time for online check-in procedures. 
Our virtual shareholder meeting format uses technology designed to increase shareholder access, save the Company and our shareholders time and money, and provide our shareholders rights and opportunities to participate in the meeting similar to what they would have at an in-person meeting. In addition to on-line attendance, we provide shareholders with an opportunity to hear all portions of the official meeting as conducted by the Chairman of the Board and the Corporate Secretary, submit written questions and comments during the meeting, and vote on-line during the open poll portion of the meeting. 
References in the Proxy Materials to the "Annual Meeting" also refer to any adjournments, postponements or changes in location of the Annual Meeting, to the extent applicable.  What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will consider and vote upon the following matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Proposal 1: The election of seven directors, each for a term to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  Proposal 2: The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's  independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
We will also consider and take action as appropriate upon such other matters that may be properly presented at the Annual Meeting or at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof. 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Only our stockholders as of close of business on Monday, March 18, 2019, the record date (the "Record Date") established by the Board for purposes of the Annual Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. 
On the Record Date, the Company had 33,889,114 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How many votes can I cast? 
You are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock that you owned on the Record Date on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting. 
What is the difference between a "stockholder of record" and a "street name stockholder"? 
Most stockholders hold their shares through a stockholder of record, such as a bank, broker or other nominee, rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares owned as a stockholder of record and those owned in street name. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with American Stock  Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, our transfer agent, you are considered the stockholder of record of those shares. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly or to vote online during the virtual  Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Street Name Stockholder. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or through a bank, broker  or other nominee, you are considered a "street name stockholder", meaning you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name", that your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or other nominee and such person  (or, Cede & Co., as the case may be) is considered the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote and you are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. If you  hold shares of a Company's common stock through a broker, bank, trustee or nominee and want to participate in the virtual Annual Meeting, you must follow the instructions you receive from your broker, bank, or other nominee.   
[END TABLE]
A list of our stockholders of record will be available and may be inspected during normal business hours for a period of at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting at the Company's headquarters, located at 1415 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900, Houston, Texas 77002. The list of stockholders of record will also be available for review during the Annual Meeting.  How do I vote my shares? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders of Record: Stockholders of record may vote their shares or submit a proxy to have their  shares voted by one of the following methods:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Internet. You may submit a proxy electronically on the Internet by following the instructions  provided on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if you received the Proxy Materials by mail, the enclosed Proxy Card. Please have the Notice of Internet Availability or Proxy Card (as applicable) in hand when you log onto the  website. Internet voting facilities will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, the day before the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone. You may submit a proxy by telephone (from U.S. and Canada only) by using the toll-free  number listed on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if you received the Proxy Materials by mail, the enclosed Proxy Card. Please have the Notice of Internet Availability or Proxy Card (as applicable) in hand when you call.  Telephone voting facilities will be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, the day before the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail. If you received the Proxy Materials by mail, you may indicate your vote by completing, signing  and dating the enclosed Proxy Card and returning it to the Company in the enclosed reply envelope.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During the Annual Meeting. You may vote virtually via the Internet during the Annual Meeting. If you  desire to vote during the meeting, please follow the instructions for attending and voting during the Annual Meeting posted at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/qes2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Street Name Stockholders: As the beneficial owner of QES stock held in street name (that is, in the  name of your broker, bank or other nominee), our Proxy Materials will be forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other nominee, who is considered the stockholder of record. As the street name stockholder, you have the right to direct the  stockholder of record how to vote. Street name stockholders may generally vote their shares or submit a proxy to have their shares voted by one of the following methods:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Referring to the voting instruction form or other information provided by the stockholder of record. Please  refer to the voting instruction form or other information provided by the stockholder of record to determine whether you may submit your vote by mail, telephone or electronically on the Internet before or during the Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
What is discretionary authority? 
If you are a stockholder of record and you properly submit your proxy without making any specific selections, your shares will be voted on each matter before the Annual Meeting in the manner recommended by the Board. If other matters not included in this proxy statement properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named on the proxy card, or otherwise designated, will have the authority to vote on those matters for you in their discretion. At this time, we are not aware of any matters that will come before the Annual Meeting other than those disclosed in this proxy statement. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, please see the discussion below regarding broker non-votes and the rules related to voting by nominees. 
Can I change my vote or revoke my proxy? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submitting written notice of revocation to Quintana Energy Services Inc., 1415 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900,  Houston, Texas 77002, Attn: Corporate Secretary, so long as such notice is timely received before the Annual Meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submitting a later dated proxy with new voting instructions by mail or through the telephone or Internet  voting systems; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attending the Annual Meeting online and voting your shares online during the Annual Meeting (attending the  Annual Meeting will not by itself have the effect of revoking a previously submitted proxy).  
[END TABLE]
If you are a street name stockholder and you vote by proxy, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to the stockholder of record for your shares in accordance with such stockholder of record's procedures. 
What is the effect of broker non-votes and abstentions and what vote is required to approve each proposal? 
If you are a street name stockholder, you will receive instructions from your bank, broker or other nominee describing how to vote your shares. If you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote your shares, such person may vote your shares as they decide as to each matter for which they have discretionary authority under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). 
There are also non-discretionary matters for which banks, brokers and other nominees do not have discretionary authority to vote unless they receive timely instructions from the street name stockholder. If you are a street name stockholder and you have not given timely instructions to the stockholder of record for your shares, and such stockholder of record does not have discretionary authority to vote your shares, a "broker non-vote" results. Although any broker non-vote would be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, it would be treated as not entitled to vote with respect to non-discretionary matters. 
Abstentions occur when stockholders are present at the Annual Meeting but fail to vote or voluntarily withhold their vote for any of the matters upon which the stockholders are voting. 
If you are a street name stockholder, and you do not give voting instructions, pursuant to NYSE Rule 452, the stockholder of record will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to Proposal 1—Election of Directors, and your shares will be considered "broker non-votes" with respect to that proposal. If you are a street name stockholder, and you do not give voting instructions, the stockholder of record will nevertheless be entitled to vote your shares in its discretion with respect to Proposal 2—Ratification of the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1—Election of Directors: To be elected as a director, each nominee must receive the  affirmative vote of a plurality of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company that are present in person or represented by proxy that are entitled to vote generally on the election of directors at the Annual Meeting,  which means that director nominees with the most votes are elected. Votes may be cast in favor of or withheld from the election of each nominee. Because there is no minimum vote required, abstentions and broker  non-votes will have no effect on the outcome.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2—Ratification of the Appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP: Ratification of the  appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common  stock of the Company that are present in person or represented by proxy that are entitled to vote. Votes may be cast for or against the proposal, or the holder may abstain. Broker non-votes will have no effect  on the outcome.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board has appointed D. Rogers Herndon, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Max L. Bouthillette, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary, as the "Proxy Holders" for the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record and you submit your Proxy Card (whether submitted by mail, telephone or Internet), unless you give other instructions on your Proxy Card, your shares will be voted by the Proxy Holders in accordance with the recommendations of the Board.  What are the Board's recommendations? 
The recommendations of the Board are set forth together with the description of each item in this Proxy Statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR each of the seven persons named in this Proxy Statement as director nominees for election  to the Board as directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's  independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

What is a quorum for purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
A quorum is the presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of all issued and outstanding common shares of the Company generally entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. There must be a quorum for the Annual Meeting to be held. The chairman of the meeting may recess or adjourn the meeting, for any reasonable reason, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, whether or not there is such a quorum. Proxies received but marked as abstentions or broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of votes considered to be present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. 
Who bears the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting? 
The Company will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies, including the cost of the preparation, assembly, printing, mailing and posting of the Proxy Materials and any additional information furnished to our stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting. In addition to this solicitation by mail, our directors, officers and other employees may solicit proxies by use of mail, telephone, facsimile, electronic means, in person or otherwise. These persons will not receive any additional compensation for assisting in the solicitation but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. We have retained Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") to aid in the distribution of Proxy Materials and to provide voting and tabulation services for the Annual Meeting. For these services, we will pay Broadridge a fee of approximately $12,000 and reimburse it for certain expenses. In addition, we will reimburse brokerage firms, nominees, fiduciaries, custodians and other agents, for their expenses in distributing the Proxy Materials to the beneficial owners of our common shares.

Vote Required 
To be elected as a director, each nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a plurality of the voting power of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company that are present in person or represented by proxy that are entitled to vote generally on the election of directors at the Annual Meeting, which means that director nominees with the most votes are elected.

Director Biographies 
Described below are the principal occupations, positions and directorships for at least the past five years of our director nominees, as well as certain additional information regarding their individual experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the Board to conclude that each of our director nominees should serve on the Board. 
D. Rogers Herndon Mr. Herndon has served as Chief Executive Officer and President and member of our Board since the Company's formation, and has served as Chief Executive Officer and President of QES LP since November 2014.

Corbin J. Robertson, Jr.    Mr. Robertson has served as chairman of the Board since our formation and has served as chairman of the board of directors of the general partner of QES LP since the board was established.

Mr. Boutté also currently serves as an independent director of Seitel Inc. Mr. Boutté has a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering from University of New Orleans and was a Visiting Fellow at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We believe that Mr. Boutté's extensive oilfield services background and his experience as an independent director of companies in the oil and natural gas industry qualify him for continued service on the Board and the Audit Committee. 
Rocky L. Duckworth Mr. Duckworth has served on Board since February 2018.

Mr. Duckworth has served on the board of directors of three public companies; Glori Energy, Inc., Northern Tier Energy GP LLC and Magnum Hunter Resources Corp. Mr. Duckworth has a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Oklahoma State University and he holds a Certified Public Accountant license in Texas and Oklahoma.

We are committed to adhering to sound principles of ethical conduct and good corporate governance. We have adopted corporate governance policies and practices that are consistent with our core values, reflect prevailing governance standards and many "best practices" features, promote the effective functioning of our Company and ensure that it is managed with integrity and in the best interest of our stockholders. 
Status as a Controlled Company 
Upon the completion of our initial public offering in February 2018 (the "IPO"), investment funds managed by Quintana Capital Group, L.P. ("Quintana"), Archer Well Company Inc. ("Archer"), Geveran Investments Limited and its affiliates ("Geveran"), Robertson QES Investment LLC ("Robertson QES") and Corbin J. Robertson, Jr. ("Mr Robertson" and, together with Quintana, Archer, Geveran, and Robertson QES, the "Principal Stockholders") owned, on a combined basis, 25,654,384 shares of our common stock, representing, on a combined basis, approximately 75.7% of the voting power of the Company as of March 18, 2019. The Principal Stockholders are deemed a group pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Equity Rights Agreement entered into in connection with our IPO (the "Equity Rights Agreement"). As a result, we are considered a "controlled company" under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley") and the rules of the NYSE. A controlled company does not need its board of directors to have a majority of independent directors or to form an independent compensation or nominating and corporate governance committee; however, as a controlled company, we remain subject to the rules of Sarbanes-Oxley and the NYSE that require us to have an audit committee composed of at least three independent directors. 
If at any time we cease to be a controlled company, we will take all action necessary to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley and the NYSE corporate governance standards, including by appointing a majority of independent directors to our Board and ensuring we have a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each composed entirely of independent directors, subject to a permitted "phase-in" period. While not currently mandatory given our controlled company status, we have voluntarily established a compensation committee that is composed of both independent and non-independent directors. The Board currently consists of a single class of directors, each serving one-year terms. After we cease to be a controlled company, the Board will be divided into three classes of directors, with each class as equal in number as possible, serving staggered three-year terms, and such directors will be removable only for "cause." 
Director Independence 
After reviewing all relationships each director has with the Company, including the nature and extent of any business relationships between the Company and such person, the Board has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Duckworth, Boutté and Shackouls has no material relationships with the Company and, is "independent" under the applicable rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the NYSE. In addition to the board-level standards for director independence, each member of the Audit Committee meets the heightened independence standards required for Audit Committee members under the NYSE and SEC rules. 
Code of Conduct 
The Board adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics Manual ("Code of Conduct") applicable to our employees, directors and officers, in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws and the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. The Code of Conduct can be found on our website located at www.quintanaenergyservices.com. Any stockholder may request a printed copy of the Code of Conduct by submitting a written request to Quintana Energy Services Inc. at 1415 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900, Houston, Texas 77002, Attn: Corporate Secretary. 
Any amendment to, or waiver from, the Code of Conduct may be made only by the Board, and any amendment or waiver that apply to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal   accounting officer or controller and are required to be disclosed will be promptly disclosed on our website as required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws and the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. There were no waivers of the Code of Conduct during 2018 or in 2019 to date. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines in accordance with the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. These guidelines should be interpreted in accordance with any requirements imposed by federal or state laws or regulations, the NYSE, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on our website located at www.quintanaenergyservices.com. 
Director Nominees and Board Membership Criteria 
We believe that our directors should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity and values and be committed to representing the long-term interests of our stockholders. They also should be intelligent, inquisitive and objective in thought and have practical wisdom, mature judgment and a willingness to gain an understanding of the Company, its competitive position in its industry and our business strategy. Directors must be willing to devote sufficient time to carrying out their duties and responsibilities effectively and should be committed to serving on the Board for an extended period of time. Along with the selection criteria described above, some of the other qualifications that the Board considers include, without limitation, independence, diversity, skills, education, expertise, business acumen, length of service, understanding of the Company and industry and other commitments. We discuss each of our continuing directors' qualifications and other characteristics under the heading "Board of Directors." 
The Equity Rights Agreement provides the Principal Stockholders with certain nomination rights. See "Status as a Controlled Company" above for more information. 
The Board will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders using the same criteria set forth above. Stockholders wishing to present a potential nominee to the Board for consideration for election at a future annual meeting of stockholders must provide the Board with notice of the recommendation and certain information regarding the candidate as described in our amended and restated bylaws and within the time periods set forth in this proxy statement under the caption "Stockholder Proposals." 
Communications with the Board 
Our Board welcomes communications from our stockholders and other interested parties. The Board has established a process for all interested parties to send communications, other than sales-related communications, to one or more of its members, including to the independent or non-management directors as a group. Interested parties may contact the Board, any Board committee, or any Board member (including the chairman of the Board), by writing to them at the following address: 
Quintana Energy Services Inc. 
1415 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900 
Houston, Texas 77002 
Attn: Corporate Secretary 
The envelope containing each communication should be clearly marked as "Shareholder Communication with Directors" and clearly identify the intended recipient(s) of the communication so that the communication can be forwarded to the specified parties. 
Our General Counsel will review and forward, as expeditiously as reasonably practicable, each communication received to the addressees if (1) the communication complies with the requirements of any applicable policy adopted by the Board relating to the subject matter of the communication and (2) the   communication falls within the scope of matters generally considered by the Board. To the extent the subject matter of a communication relates to matters that have been delegated by the Board to a committee or to an executive officer of the Company, then the Company's General Counsel may forward the communication to the executive officer or chairman of the committee to which the matter has been delegated.  INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES 
Overview 
Our Board currently consists of seven members. Pursuant to the Equity Rights Agreement, Quintana has the right to appoint two directors to our Board, Archer has the right to appoint two directors to our Board and Geveran has the right to appoint one director to our Board. The current board representative appointed by Quintana is Corbin J. Robertson, Jr. The current board representatives appointed by Archer are Dag Skindlo and Gunnar Eliassen. 
In accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, until we cease to be a controlled company, all directors are to be elected annually. After we cease to be a controlled company, the Board will be divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. 
The Board has two standing committees to assist in discharging its responsibilities: the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Among other actions, the Board reviews its structure and appoints members to its various committees on an annual basis. Additional information about each committee is set forth below under "Committees of the Board." 
Directors are elected by our stockholders, and we have a plurality vote standard for director elections. Upon our formation, the current directors were appointed to the Board, with two of the seven directors newly joining the Board upon the closing of the IPO. Additionally, Bobby S. Shackouls was appointed to the Board in January 2019. 
The following table identifies the current members of the Board, the standing committees of the Board on which they serve and the chairman of each committee as of the date of this Proxy Statement.

Meetings of the Board and its Committees 
During 2018, the Board held 10 meetings and met in executive session on 4 of those occasions. Generally executive sessions are held without management present. Committee meetings were held in 2018 as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Committee    6 
 Compensation Committee    4 
[END TABLE]
All members of the Board attended, on average, at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board and the total number of meetings held by each committee on which he served in 2018.  From time to time between meetings, Board and committee members confer with each other and with management and independent consultants regarding relevant issues, and representatives of management may meet with such consultants on behalf of the relevant committee. 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors are expected to attend meetings of the Board and of committees on which they serve and to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities. Directors are encouraged but not required to attend our annual stockholder meetings. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine an appropriate board leadership structure to provide for independent oversight of management. The Board believes that there is no single, generally accepted board leadership structure that is appropriate for all companies, and that the right structure may vary for a single company as circumstances change. As such, the Board evaluates its leadership structure at least annually, and may modify this structure from time to time to best address the Company's unique circumstances and advance the best interests of all stockholders, as and when appropriate. 
The Board believes it is important to retain its flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the "CEO") in any way that is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Board will from time to time make a determination as to whether the offices of the chairman of the Board and the CEO should be separated and review the appropriateness of its current policies in connection with the recruitment and succession of the chairman of the Board and/or the CEO. The Board has determined that the roles of chairman of the Board and CEO should continue to remain separate and that Mr. Robertson should continue to serve as the chairman of the Board. The Board believes that this governance structure will allow Mr. Herndon to focus his time and energy on managing the Company and Mr. Robertson to lead the Board in its fundamental role of providing guidance, advice and counsel regarding our business, operations and strategy, and that having a separate chairman of the Board will better position the Board in evaluating the performance of management and our overall corporate performance. The Board believes that Mr. Robertson's deep knowledge and understanding of our industry, along with his past experience as our Board chairman, puts him in the best position to lead our Board. 
The non-management directors have regularly scheduled meetings in executive session, to be held as determined necessary and appropriate by the chairman of the Board or any director, and which are held at a minimum following each regularly scheduled quarterly board meeting. In the event that the non-management directors include directors who are not independent under the listing requirements of the NYSE, then at least once a year, there is an executive session including only independent directors. Mr. Duckworth currently serves at the presiding director at executive sessions of our Board. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board believes that risk management is an integral part of setting and implementing our strategic plan, which includes, among other things, identifying and assessing the major risks and opportunities facing the Company. This oversight function is conducted primarily through the standing committees of the Board, but the full Board retains responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Audit Committee is charged with oversight of our system of internal controls and risks relating to financial reporting, legal, regulatory and accounting compliance. Our Board continues to satisfy its oversight responsibility through full reports from the Audit Committee chair regarding the committee's considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within our Company. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management generally, and also specifically with respect to financial reporting, internal controls and accounting matters, legal, tax and regulatory compliance, cyber and data matters,   and the internal audit function. The Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that an effective risk assessment process is in place, and quarterly reports are made to the Audit Committee on material risks facing the Company. Upon request, both the full Board and Audit Committee may receive reports from those executive officers who are deemed responsible for particular risks due to being in a position that makes them most likely to be able to impact the effects of such risks. The Audit Committee also oversees our internal audit function, which is responsible for monitoring the Company's adherence to our significant corporate policies and internal controls. Our Compensation Committee assists our Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation and health and welfare benefits policies and programs. 
Committees of the Board 
As noted above, our Board has two standing committees: the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. Each committee has a charter, which is available on our website at http://www.quintanaenergyservices.com/governance-docs under "Governance—Governance Documents." Stockholders may obtain printed copies of any charter, free of charge, by sending a written request to Quintana Energy Services Inc. at 1415 Louisiana Street, Suite 2900, Houston, Texas 77002, Attn: Corporate Secretary, or by emailing IR@quintanaenergyservices.com. 
A description of each committee, its function and its charter, are provided below: 
Audit Committee 
Our Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks relating to financial reporting, internal controls and accounting matters, as well as legal, tax and regulatory compliance, and our internal audit systems. Pursuant to its charter, the purposes of the Audit Committee are to:

In connection with these purposes and to satisfy its oversight responsibilities, our Audit Committee annually selects, engages and evaluates the performance and ongoing qualifications of, and determines the compensation for, our independent registered public accounting firm, reviews our annual and quarterly financial statements, and confirms the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Audit Committee meets regularly with our management, internal auditors and our independent registered public accounting firm   regarding the adequacy of our financial controls and our compliance with legal, tax and regulatory matters and our significant corporate policies. Our Audit Committee separately meets regularly with our independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer and other members of senior management. Our Audit Committee chairman routinely meets between formal committee meetings with our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, internal auditors and our independent registered public accounting firm. Our Audit Committee also receives regular reports regarding issues such as the status and findings of audits being conducted by the internal and independent auditors, accounting changes that could affect our financial statements and proposed audit adjustments. 
The current members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Boutté, Duckworth (chairman) and Shackouls. Our Board has determined that (i) all members of our Audit Committee are independent as that term is defined by the listing requirements of the NYSE and by Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), (ii) each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate, and (iii) Mr. Duckworth has the necessary accounting and financial expertise to serve as chairman of the Audit Committee. In making this determination, our Board considered the current and prior relationships that each director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence. Our Board has also determined that Mr. Duckworth is an "audit committee financial expert" following a determination that he has met the criteria for such designation under the rules and regulations of the SEC. For information regarding Messrs. Boutté, Duckworth and Shackouls' business experience please read 
"Board of Directors." 
The Audit Committee held six meetings during 2018. 
Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for the oversight of risks relating to the compensation of our executive officers and directors, as well as our compensation and benefit plans, policies and programs. Pursuant to its charter, the purposes of the Compensation Committee are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review, evaluate and approve the agreements, plans, policies and programs of the Company to compensate the  Company's executive officers and directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and discuss with the Company's management the executive compensation disclosures included in the  Company's Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as applicable, and determine whether to recommend to the Board that such disclosure be included in the Proxy  Statement or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as applicable, in accordance with applicable rules and regulations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Otherwise discharge the Board's responsibilities relating to compensation of the Company's executive  officers and directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Perform such other functions as our Board may assign to our Compensation Committee from time to time.   
[END TABLE]
In connection with these purposes, our Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee the overall responsibility for establishing, implementing and monitoring compensation for our executive officers. Together with management (with the exception of compensation matters related to our CEO), and any counsel or other advisors it deems appropriate, the Compensation Committee reviews and discusses each particular executive compensation matter presented and makes a final determination. For example, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation of our executive officers and makes appropriate adjustments based on Company performance, achievement of predetermined goals and changes in an executive officer's duties and responsibilities. The Compensation Committee may delegate to its chairman, any member or to a sub-committee the responsibility and authority for any particular matter, as it deems appropriate from time to time under the circumstances.  Under its charter, the Compensation Committee also has the authority to retain, compensate, direct, oversee and terminate outside counsel, compensation consultants and other advisors hired to assist the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee currently retains Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") as its independent compensation consultant for matters related to executive and director compensation. In selecting FW Cook as its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of FW Cook pursuant to SEC rules and requested an independence letter from FW Cook, as well as other documentation addressing the firm's independence. FW Cook reports exclusively to the Compensation Committee and does not provide any additional services to the Company. Compensation Committee discussed these considerations and concluded that FW Cook is independent and that no conflicts of interest exist with FW Cook. 
As a controlled company we are not required to have a fully independent compensation committee. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Boutté (chairman), Duckworth, Robertson, and Skindlo. The Board has determined that each of Messrs. Boutté, and Duckworth is "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards. In making this determination, the Board considered the current and prior relationships that each such director has with our Company and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence. For each independent member of the compensation committee, our Board considered all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to the Company that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a compensation committee member, including the sources of such director's compensation, such as any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees paid by the Company, and whether the director has an affiliate relationship with the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the Company. 
The Compensation Committee held four meetings during 2018. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During 2018, no person who served as a member of the Compensation Committee served as an officer or employee of the Company. Additionally, none of our executive officers (including any person who served as an executive officer at any point in 2018) has served as a director or member of a compensation committee (or other committee performing similar functions) of any other entity of which an executive officer served on our Board or our Compensation Committee. 
Please see "Transactions with Related Persons" for a description of certain related party transactions with the Principal Stockholders and Mr. Robertson. Mr. Robertson is a Principal of Quintana and Mr. Skindlo is a member of the board of directors and the Chief Financial Officer of Archer. 
Director Search Process 
In 2017 and 2018, the Company conducted a director search for its initial two independent directors leading to the appointment of Messrs. Boutte and Duckworth, who were recommended to us by the Company's security holders, directors and executive officers. In 2018 and 2019, the Company leveraged its security holders, directors and executive officers to identify potential candidates for its third independent director. The Company retained Spencer Stuart, Inc. ("Spencer Stuart"), an independent third-party executive search firm, to provide additional background information and assessments of qualifications on the potential candidates, including Mr. Shackouls. The Board then reviewed the results of Spencer Stuart's evaluation and screening, discussed potential nominees, and appointed Mr. Shackouls to the Board.  PROPOSAL 2—RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work of the principal independent public accountants retained to audit our financial statements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") has been selected by the Audit Committee, and approved by the Board, as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the Company's annual financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers at the Annual Meeting. The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the shares of our common stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Although ratification is not required by our amended and restated bylaws or otherwise, as a matter of good corporate governance, we are asking our stockholders to approve the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent registered public accounting firm. If the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers is not approved, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers is ratified, our Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our best interest and in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since our formation in 2017 (and for our predecessor companies since 2010). The Audit Committee considers PricewaterhouseCoopers to be well qualified and recommends that the stockholders vote for ratification of this appointment. 
A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so. It is also expected that such representative will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.

The Audit Committee is also responsible for confirming the independence and objectivity of our independent registered public accounting firm. Our independent registered public accounting firm is given unrestricted access to the Audit Committee and our management, as necessary.

Additional Narrative Disclosures 
Base Salary 
Each named executive officer's base salary is a fixed component of compensation that does not vary depending on the level of performance achieved. Base salaries are determined for each named executive officer based on his position and responsibility. Our Board reviews the base salaries for each named executive officer annually as well as at the time of any promotion or significant change in job responsibilities and, in connection with each review, such Board has considered individual and company performance over the course of the applicable year. Pursuant to the employment agreements between us and each named executive officer, a named executive officer's base salary may be increased but not decreased without the named executive officer's written consent.  In March 2018, our Board determined that an increase in the base salary of our named executive officers was warranted following the successful completion of our IPO. The following table sets forth the base salaries of our named executive officers before such increase and after such increase: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name     Base Salary (January to March 2018)       Base Salary (March to December 2018)   
Name     Base Salary (January to March 2018)       Base Salary (March to December 2018)

 Keefer M. Lehner    $ 280,000      $ 375,000   
[END TABLE]
Incentive Compensation Programs 
In March 2018, our Board established the 2018 Incentive Compensation Program for certain key personnel, including our named executive officers, in order to recognize their contribution to our business. Under the 2018 Incentive Compensation Program, we provided our named executive officers with the opportunity to earn a cash incentive bonus for fiscal year 2018 based on our financial performance as measured by adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures, adjusted EBITDA, absolute stock price, safety measures and discretionary metrics. Our named executive officers were eligible to earn a target incentive bonus in the following amounts: (i) Mr. Herndon, $550,000, (ii) Mr. Baker, $300,000 and (iii) Mr. Lehner, $281,250. Subject to the satisfaction of the applicable performance goal and each named executive officer's continuous employment by us through the applicable payment date, our named executive officers were eligible to earn between 0% and 200% of the target incentive bonus. For fiscal year 2018, our Board determined that Mr. Herndon earned $435,050, Mr. Baker earned $261,300 and Mr. Lehner earned $222,469 under the 2018 Incentive Compensation Program. 
Equity Awards 
Phantom Units 
Pursuant to the Quintana Energy Services LP Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Prior Plan"), our named executive officers were previously granted awards of phantom units in QES LP. Each phantom unit represented the right to receive one common unit of QES LP (or, if elected by the board of directors of the general partner of QES LP, an amount in cash equal to fair market value of one common unit of QES LP) upon full vesting of such phantom unit. In addition, upon full vesting of a named executive officer's phantom units, the named executive officer would have been entitled to receive the accrued value of any distributions that would have been paid had the named executive officer been a holder of the number of common units subject to the award from the date of grant. In connection with our IPO, all outstanding phantom units were equitably adjusted and converted into rights to receive shares of our common stock (or, if elected by our Board, cash equal to the fair market value thereof). 
Such phantom units are subject to (i) time vesting in four equal installments on the first four anniversaries of the applicable date of grant as set forth in each named executive officer's phantom unit agreement (or, if earlier, become 100% time vested upon the consummation of a change in control) and (ii) event vesting, which requires the consummation of a change in control or a specified transaction. On the seventh anniversary of the grant date of an award of phantom units, any phantom units that have not fully vested will be automatically terminated and forfeited. The phantom unit agreements also include certain restrictive covenants, including provisions that generally prohibit our named executive officers from soliciting customers, officers or employees of us or our affiliates during the term of each named executive officer's employment with us and for a period of one year following the termination of such employment. 
Our IPO constituted a specified transaction under the phantom unit agreements and, as a result, phantom units held by our named executive officers became event vested upon the consummation of our IPO. However, in order to become fully vested, the phantom units must also become time vested. In February 2018, one-fourth of the phantom units held by our named executive officers became time vested and, hence, fully vested. Such   phantom units were settled in March 2018 and our named executive officers received shares of our common stock upon settlement. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Herndon held 205,594 unvested phantom units, Mr. Baker held 162,761 unvested phantom units and Mr. Lehner held 111,363 unvested phantom units 
Restricted Stock Units 
Pursuant to the 2018 Plan, our named executive officers were granted awards of restricted stock units ("RSUs") in April 2018. Mr. Herndon was granted 52,250 RSUs, Mr. Baker was granted 38,000 RSUs and Mr. Lehner was granted 35,625 RSUs. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock upon vesting of such RSU. Such RSUs are subject to time-based vesting in three equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the applicable date of grant as set forth in each named executive officer's RSU agreement. 
Any unvested RSUs will immediately become vested upon the termination of a named executive officer's employment (i) due to disability, (ii) due to death or (iii) by us without cause or by such named executive officer for good reason during the protection period. In addition, all unvested RSUs that would have vested on the next applicable vesting date and 50% of all remaining unvested RSUs will immediately become vested upon the termination of a named executive officer's employment by us without cause or by such named executive officer for good reason outside of the protection period. The RSU agreements also include certain restrictive covenants, including provisions that generally prohibit our named executive officers from soliciting customers, officers or employees of us or our affiliates during the term of each named executive officer's employment with us and for a period of one year following the termination of such employment. 
Performance Share Units 
Pursuant to the 2018 Plan, our named executive officers were granted awards of performance share units ("PSUs") in April 2018. Mr. Herndon was granted 104,500 target PSUs, Mr. Baker was granted 76,000 target PSUs and Mr. Lehner was granted 71,250 target PSUs. Each award of PSUs represents the right to receive shares of our common stock in an amount between 0% and 150% of the target PSUs granted to each named executive officer based on the level of achievement with respect to certain performance goals and satisfaction of certain time-based vesting requirements. One-half of the target PSUs were subject to a relative total stockholder return ("Relative TSR") performance goal and one-half of the target PSUs were subject to an absolute total stockholder return ("Absolute TSR") performance goal, in each case, that was measured during a performance period that commenced on February 9, 2018 and ended on December 31, 2018. Based on achievement with respect to the Relative TSR and Absolute TSR performance goals during the performance period, it was determined that Mr. Herndon earned 31,350 PSUs, Mr. Baker earned 22,800 PSUs and Mr. Lehner earned 21,375 PSUs. In order to receive settlement of the earned PSUs, such earned PSUs must also become time vested in three equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the performance period commencement date. Any earned PSUs that have not become time vested will immediately become time vested upon the termination of a named executive officer's employment by us without cause, by such named executive officer for good reason or due to disability or death. 
Other Benefits 
We offer participation in broad-based retirement, health and welfare plans to all of our employees. We maintain a plan intended to provide benefits under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "401(k) Plan"), where employees are allowed to contribute portions of their base compensation into a retirement account in order to encourage all employees, including any participating named executive officers, to save for the future. 
Employment Agreements 
Effective July 1, 2017, we entered into employment agreements with our named executive officers (the "Employment Agreements"). Each Employment Agreement generally provides for a three-year term, which   commenced on July 1, 2017, with automatic renewals for successive one-year periods thereafter. Each Employment Agreement generally outlines the named executive officer's duties and positions and provides for (i) an annualized base salary, (ii) a discretionary annual cash incentive bonus with a target amount equal to 100% of base salary for Mr. Herndon, as Chief Executive Officer and 75% of base salary for each of Mr. Baker and Mr. Lehner, respectively as the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer and (iii) eligibility to participate in any equity compensation arrangements or plans offered by us to senior executives. 
Each Employment Agreement provides for the following benefits upon a termination of a named executive officer's employment by us without cause, resignation by a named executive officer for good reason or due to disability: (i) a lump sum payment equal to (A) for Mr. Herndon, two times Mr. Herndon's base salary or (B) for Messrs. Baker and Lehner, one and one-half times the named executive officer's base salary, (ii) an amount equal to (A) for Mr. Herndon, two times Mr. Herndon's target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs or (B) for Messrs. Baker and Lehner, one and one-half times the named executive officer's target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs, in each case, payable in four equal installments with the first installment paid on the Company's first regular pay date on or after the 60th day following such termination and the remaining three installments paid in each of the three calendar quarters immediately following the quarter in which the termination occurs and (iii) for a period of 18 months following such termination, reimbursement of premiums paid by the executive pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and/or sections 601 through 608 of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974 to continue coverage in our health, dental and vision insurance plans in which the executive and/or his dependents participated immediately prior to the termination (the "COBRA Premium"), provided that such reimbursement does not subject us or our affiliates to sanctions imposed pursuant to Section 2716 of the Public Health Service Act and related regulations and guidance (collectively, the "PHSA"). If a named executive officer's employment is terminated due to death, the named executive officer's estate will be entitled to receive (i) a pro-rata share of the named executive officer's target bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs and (ii) continued payments of the named executive officer's base salary for a period of 12 months. 
Under each Employment Agreement, if a named executive officer's employment is terminated for good reason or without cause within 12 months of a change in control, then the named executive officer will be entitled to receive: (i) a lump sum payment equal to two times the named executive officer's base salary, (ii) an amount equal to the named executive officer's target bonus for two years, payable in four equal installments with the first installment on the Company's first regular pay date on or after the 60th day following such termination and the remaining three installments paid in each of the three calendar quarters immediately following the quarter in which the termination occurs and (iii) for a period of 18 months following such termination, reimbursement of the COBRA Premium, provided that such reimbursement does not subject us or our affiliates to sanctions imposed pursuant to Section 2716 of the PHSA. 
If a named executive officer is terminated for any reason other than those described above, no further compensation or benefits will be provided pursuant to the Employment Agreements. The Employment Agreements also contain certain restrictive covenants, including provisions that generally prohibit a named executive officer from competing with the Company and its affiliates or soliciting clients, executives, officers, directors or other employees of the Company and its affiliates. These restrictions generally apply during the term of the named executive officer's employment and for a period of one year following the termination of such employment. 
The Employment Agreements do not provide a tax gross-up provision for federal excise taxes that may be imposed under Section 4999 of the Code. Instead, each Employment Agreement includes a modified cutback provision, which states that, if amounts payable to a named executive officer under the Employment Agreement, together with any other amounts that are payable by us as a result of a change in control (the "Payments"), exceed the amount allowed under Section 280G of the Code for such named executive officer, thereby subjecting the named executive officer to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Payments will either be: (i) reduced to the level at which no excise tax applies, such that the full amount of the Payments would be equal   to $1 less than three times the named executive officer's "base amount," which is generally the average W-2 earnings for the five calendar years immediately preceding the date of termination, or (ii) paid in full, which would subject the named executive officer to the excise tax. We will determine, in good faith, which alternative produces the best net after tax position for a named executive officer. 
Indemnification Agreements 
We entered into indemnification agreements with each of the directors and executive officers effective upon the closing of our IPO and upon the addition of our new director. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding in which they are involved by reason of their service to us and, if requested, to advance expenses incurred as a result of any such proceeding.

The Section 16 Reporting Persons are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. 
Based solely on a review of the reports furnished to the Company by, or written representations from, the Section 16 Reporting Persons that all reportable transactions were reported, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Section 16 Reporting Persons timely filed all reports that such persons were required to file under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act.

Procedures for Review, Approval and Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
A "Related Party Transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship in which we or any of our subsidiaries was, is or will be a participant, the amount of which involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A "Related Person" means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any person who is, or at any time during the applicable period was, one of our executive officers or one of  our directors;  
• any person who is known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of our common stock;   
• any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, which means any child, stepchild, parent,  stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of a director, executive officer or a beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of our common stock,  and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such director, executive officer or beneficial owner of more than 5.0% of our common stock; and  
• any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is a partner or principal or in a  similar position or in which such person has a 10.0% or greater beneficial ownership interest.  
[END TABLE]
In connection with the IPO, the Board adopted a written Related Party Transaction Policy. Pursuant to this policy, our Audit Committee will review all material facts of all Related Party Transactions and either approve or disapprove entry into the Related Party Transaction, subject to certain limited exceptions. In determining whether to approve or disapprove entry into a Related Party Transaction, our Audit Committee shall take into account, among other factors, the following: (i) whether the Related Party Transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and (ii) the extent of the Related Person's interest in the transaction. Any member of the Audit Committee who is a Related Person with respect to the transaction will be recused from the review and approval process. If a Related Party Transaction will be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for the Company's management   team to follow in its ongoing dealings with the Related Person. Therefore, the Audit Committee annually reviews and assesses ongoing relationships with the Related Persons to confirm they are in compliance with the Audit Committee's guidelines and that the Related Party Transaction remains appropriate. Furthermore, the policy requires that all Related Party Transactions required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC be so disclosed in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
All of the transactions described above, except for participation in our IPO, have been approved pursuant to the Related Party Transaction Policy. The Audit Committee separately ratified the IPO Purchases, which were entered into prior to the adoption of the Related Party Transaction Policy.  OTHER MATTERS 
Other Business That May Occur 
As of the date of filing this Proxy Statement, the Board is not aware of any other business or matter (including any other director nominee) to be presented or voted upon at the Annual Meeting. If any other matter is properly presented at the meeting, the proxies solicited by the Board will provide the proxy holders named in the proxy with the authority to vote on those matters in accordance with such persons' discretion. Where a stockholder has appropriately specified how a proxy is to be voted, it will be voted by the proxy holders in accordance with the specification. 
Stockholder Proposals 
Any stockholder interested in submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials and for presentation at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders who wishes to have such proposal (a "Rule 14a-8 Proposal") included in the Company's proxy materials, must submit such Rule 14a-8 Proposal to the Company at its principal executive offices no later than November 30, 2019, or otherwise as permitted by applicable law. The form and substance of these proposals must satisfy the requirements established by the Company's amended and restated bylaws and the SEC. 
In addition to the requirements of Rule 14a-8, and as more specifically provided for in our amended and restated bylaws, any stockholders seeking to recommend a director candidate or who intend to present a stockholder proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting not intended to be included in the proxy materials must give timely and proper notice to our Corporate Secretary at least 90 days but not more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In other words, for a stockholder nomination for election to our Board to be considered at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, it should be properly submitted to our Corporate Secretary no earlier than January 15, 2020 and no later than February 14, 2020 (provided, however, that in the event that the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the notice must be given at least 120 days but not more than 100 days prior to the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or not later than 10 days following the date on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is made). Notice must be tendered in the proper form prescribed by our amended and restated bylaws. Proposals not meeting the requirements set forth in our amended and restated bylaws will not be entertained at the annual meeting. 
Any stockholder seeking to recommend a director candidate or any director candidate who wishes to be considered by the Board must provide our Corporate Secretary with the information required by our amended and restated bylaws, which includes: (a) all information relating to such nominee that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement for the election of such nominee as a director and such nominee's written consent to serve as a director if elected and (b) such other information as the Company may reasonably require to determine the eligibility of the proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company or that the Company believes could be material to a reasonable stockholder's understanding of the independence (both from management and from the stockholders or, if the proposal is made on behalf of a beneficial owner other than the stockholder of record, from such beneficial owner), or qualifications of such nominee. The Board is not required to consider director candidates received after the applicable date or without the required information. The Board will consider all director candidates who comply with these requirements and will evaluate these candidates using the criteria described above under the caption "Corporate Governance—Director Nominees and Board Membership Criteria." Director candidates who are then nominated by the Board will be included in the Company's proxy statement for that annual meeting. 
2018 Annual Report 
A copy of our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (including the financial statements and the financial statement   schedules, if any, but not including exhibits), will be furnished at no charge to each person to whom a Proxy Statement is delivered upon the written request of such person.

Householding 
We may send a single set of Proxy Materials and other stockholder communications to any household at which two or more stockholders reside unless we have received contrary instructions from those stockholders. This process is called "householding." This reduces duplicate mailings and saves printing and postage costs as well as natural resources.
