JOINT PROXY STATEMENT 
February 20, 2019 
This joint Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by and on behalf of the Board of Trustees of each of the Goldman Sachs MLP Income Opportunities Fund ("GMZ") and the Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund ("GER") (each, a "Fund" and together, the "Funds") for use at the Funds' joint Annual Meeting to be held at the offices of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. ("GSAM" or "Investment Adviser"), located at 30 Hudson Street, 21st Floor—Room 21L, Jersey City, New Jersey, 07302, on March 28, 2019, at 9:30 a.m. (Eastern time), or any postponement or adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Joint Annual Meeting. Such meeting and any postponement or adjournment thereof is referred to as the "Meeting." Please note that if you plan to attend the Meeting, photographic identification as well as proof of ownership of Fund shares, such as a copy of your proxy voting card, voting instruction form or brokerage statement showing your holdings of Fund shares, will be required for admission. This joint Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Joint Annual Meeting, and the accompanying proxy card and voting instruction form (or, if applicable, the appropriate notice of where to access these materials) are being mailed to Shareholders on or about February 22, 2019. 
The Trustees have fixed the close of business on February 4, 2019 as the record date for the determination of Shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting (the "Record Date"). Shareholders of record of a Fund on the Record Date are entitled to one vote per share at the Meeting. As of the Record Date, the number of outstanding shares of beneficial interest of each Fund was: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Fund    Ticker Symbol      Shares Outstanding   
 Goldman Sachs MLP Income Opportunities Fund      GMZ        44,422,444   
 Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund      GER        79,468,351   
[END TABLE]
It is expected that the solicitation of proxies will be primarily by mail. The Funds' officers, and personnel of the Funds' investment adviser and transfer agent and any authorized proxy solicitation agent, may also solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, Internet or in person. If a Fund records votes through the Internet or by telephone, it will use procedures designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their instructions, and to confirm that their identities have been properly recorded. 
The Funds will pay all expenses associated with this joint Proxy Statement and solicitation, in a manner agreed upon by the Boards of Trustees. The Funds have engaged Computershare Fund Services ("CFS"), an independent proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the proxy solicitation. The cost of proxy solicitation services (which include printing, distribution, solicitation and tabulation services) with respect to GMZ and GER is estimated to be approximately $32,000 and $50,000, respectively, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.  To vote by mail, sign, date and promptly return the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form in the accompanying postage pre-paid envelope. To vote by Internet or telephone, please use the control number on your proxy card or voting instruction form and follow the instructions as described on your proxy card or voting instruction form. If you have any questions regarding the proxy materials, please contact your Fund at 1-877-632-0899. If the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form is properly executed and received prior to the Meeting and has not been revoked, the shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked on the returned proxy card or voting instruction form or, if no instructions are marked on the returned proxy card or voting instruction form, the proxy card or voting instruction form will be voted "FOR" the election of the Nominees described in this joint Proxy Statement, and in the discretion of the persons named as proxies in connection with any other matter that may properly come before the Meeting or any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof. 
Any person giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by submitting to the Secretary of the Funds, c/o Goldman Sachs Funds, P.O. Box 06050, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6306, a written notice of revocation or subsequently executed proxy or voting instruction form or by attending the Meeting and electing to vote in person. 
If (i) you are a member of a household in which multiple Shareholders of a Fund share the same address, (ii) your shares are held in "street name" and (iii) your broker or bank has received consent to household material, then your broker or bank may have sent to your household only one copy of this joint Proxy Statement, unless your broker or bank previously received contrary instructions from a Shareholder in your household. If you are part of a household that has received only one copy of this joint Proxy Statement, your Fund will deliver promptly a separate copy of this joint Proxy Statement to you upon written or oral request. To receive a separate copy of this joint Proxy Statement, please contact your Fund by calling toll free 1-877-632-0899 or by mail at such Fund, c/o Goldman Sachs Funds, P.O. Box 06050, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6306. If your shares are held with certain banks, trust companies, brokers, dealers, investment advisers and other financial intermediaries (each, an "Authorized Institution") and you would like to receive a separate copy of future proxy statements, prospectuses or annual reports or you are now receiving multiple copies of these documents and would like to receive a single copy in the future, please contact your Authorized Institution. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE JOINT ANNUAL MEETING TO BE HELD ON MARCH 28, 2019 
This joint Proxy Statement is available online at https://www.proxy-direct.com/gld-30406 (please have the control number found on your proxy card or voting instruction form ready when you visit this website). 
In addition, copies of each Fund's most recent annual and semi-annual report, including financial statements, have previously been mailed to Shareholders. Each Fund will furnish to any Shareholder upon request, without charge, an additional copy of such Fund's most recent annual report and semi-annual report to Shareholders. Annual reports and semi-annual reports to Shareholders may be obtained by writing to: the Fund, c/o Goldman Sachs Funds, P.O. Box 06050, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6306; or by telephone toll-free at 1-800-621-2550.  PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF TRUSTEES 
Proposal 1 relates to the election of Trustees to the Board of Trustees of each Fund (each, a "Board" and together, the "Boards"). Shareholders of the Goldman Sachs MLP Income Opportunities Fund ("GMZ") are being asked to elect two Class II Trustees, Linda A. Lang and James A. McNamara. Shareholders of the Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund ("GER") are being asked to elect one Class I Trustee, Michael Latham (each, a "Nominee" and together, the "Nominees"). 
Each Board is divided into three classes. For every class, a Trustee holds office for a three-year term (or for an initial period that is consistent with the election schedule of his or her respective classes) and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, removal or disqualification. Shareholders of GMZ are being asked to elect two Class II Trustees (Linda A. Lang and James A. McNamara). Shareholders of GER are being asked to elect one Class I Trustee (Michael Latham). Each Nominee has indicated his or her willingness to serve if elected. 
Information concerning the Nominees and other relevant factors is provided below. Using the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form or voting by the Internet or by telephone, a Shareholder may authorize proxies to vote his or her shares for the Nominees or may withhold from the proxies authority to vote his or her shares for the Nominees. If the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form is properly executed and received prior to the Meeting (and has not been revoked) but no instructions are marked, the proxies will vote "FOR" the Nominees. Each Nominee has consented to his or her nomination and has agreed to serve if elected. If, at the time of the Meeting, for any reason, any Nominee is not available for election or able to serve as a Trustee, the proxies will exercise their voting power in favor of such substitute Nominee, if any, as the Trustees may designate. The Funds have no reason to believe that it will be necessary to designate a substitute Nominee. 
Each Fund's Governance and Nominating Committee, which is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Boards with respect to the composition of the Board, reviewed the requisite skills of the Nominees and criteria for new Trustees. Each Board believes that this proposal is in the best interests of the Fund and its Shareholders, and unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the election of all Nominees. 
The following table sets forth the names of the Nominees and the current Trustees and their addresses, ages, terms of office (including length of time served as a Trustee, as applicable), principal occupations for at least the past five years, any other directorships they hold in companies which are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), and the number of portfolios in the Goldman Sachs Fund Complex (as defined below) that they oversee (or will oversee if elected). The Nominees and Trustees who are not deemed to be "interested persons" of the Funds are referred to as   "Independent Trustees." The Nominee who is deemed to be an "interested person" of the Funds is referred to as "Interested Trustee."

No Trustee or Nominee who is not an interested person of the Funds, or any immediate family member of such person, owns securities in the Investment Adviser, or a person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Investment Adviser. 
The significance or relevance of a Trustee's particular experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills is considered by each Board on an individual basis. Experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills common to all Trustees include the ability to critically review, evaluate and discuss information provided to them and to interact effectively with the other Trustees and with representatives of the Investment Adviser and its affiliates, other service providers, legal counsel and the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, the capacity to address financial and legal issues and exercise reasonable business judgment, and a commitment to the representation of the interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Each Governance and Nominating Committee's charter contains certain other factors that are considered by the Governance and Nominating Committee in identifying and evaluating potential nominees to serve as Independent Trustees. Based on the Nominees' experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills, considered individually and with respect to the experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills of the current Trustees, each Board has concluded that the Nominees should serve as Trustees. Below is a brief discussion of the experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills of the Nominees and each of the current Trustees as of February 20, 2019 that led each Board to conclude that such individual should serve as a Trustee.

The Trustees held seven meetings during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. No Trustee attended fewer than seventy-five percent of the meetings held by the Board or by any committee of which he or she was a member while he or she was a Trustee during such year. 
Each Board has established four standing committees in connection with their governance of its Fund – Audit, Governance and Nominating, Compliance and Contract Review. 
Audit Committee 
Each Audit Committee oversees the audit process and provides assistance to its Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in overseeing financial reporting. Each Audit Committee also assists its Board with the oversight of the Fund's compliance with regulatory requirements that relate to the Fund's accounting and financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting and independent audits. Each Committee has been established by and among the Trustees for the purpose of, among other things, assisting the applicable Board with oversight of (1) the integrity of the Fund's financial statements, (2) the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) the independent auditor's qualifications and independence (in connection with evaluation and selection of the independent auditor), (4) the performance of the Fund's internal audit function and independent auditor, and (5) preparation of the Audit Committee report required to be included in the Fund's proxy statement. All of the Independent Trustees serve on each Audit Committee. None of the members of the Audit Committees has any relationship to the Funds that may interfere with the exercise of his or her independence from management or the Funds, and each is independent as defined under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") applicable to closed-end funds. Caroline Dorsa has been designated as each Board's "audit committee financial expert." Ms. Dorsa simultaneously serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies and the Board has determined that her simultaneous service on the audit committees of other public companies does not impair her ability to effectively serve on each Audit Committee. Each Audit Committee held seven meetings during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. Each Audit Committee acts according to the Audit Committee charter, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A. 
Audit Committee Report 
Each Audit Committee has: (a) reviewed and discussed the Fund's audited financial statements with the management of the Fund; (b) discussed with the independent auditor the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Standard No. 16, as modified or supplemented; and (c) received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditor required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526 regarding the independent auditor's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent auditor the auditor's independence. 
The members of each Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management or internal control purposes. Moreover, each Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the Fund's independent auditor. Accordingly, each Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, each Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and the Fund's independent auditor, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of   the Audit Committee set forth in the charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee of each Fund recommended to the applicable Board that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018.

Governance and Nominating Committee 
Each Governance and Nominating Committee has been established to: (i) assist the applicable Board in matters involving fund governance and industry best practices; (ii) with respect to the selection and nomination of Independent Trustees, satisfying certain regulatory requirements adopted by the SEC; and (iii) advise the applicable Board from time to time on ways to improve its effectiveness. All of the Independent Trustees serve on each Governance and Nominating Committee. Each Governance and Nominating Committee held five meetings during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. Each Governance and Nominating Committee acts pursuant to a written charter, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B. 
In connection with the selection and nomination of candidates to each Board, each Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates the qualifications of candidates for Board membership and their independence from the Fund's investment adviser and other principal service providers. Persons selected as Independent Trustee candidates must be independent under the provisions of the 1940 Act. In this regard, with respect to the Independent Trustee Nominee, each Governance and Nominating Committee considers the effect of any relationships beyond those delineated in the 1940 Act that might impair independence (for example, business, financial or family relationships with the investment adviser or other service providers). Without limiting the foregoing, each Governance and Nominating Committee considers, among other criteria, a candidate's: (i) experience in business, financial or investment matters or in other fields of endeavor; (ii) financial literacy and/or whether he or she is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 3 of Form N-CSR; (iii) reputation; (iv) ability to attend scheduled Board and committee meetings; (v) general availability to attend to Board business on short notice; (vi) actual or potential business, family or other conflicts bearing on either the candidate's independence or the business of the Fund; (vii) length of potential service; (viii) commitment to the representation of the interests of the Funds and their shareholders; (ix) commitment to maintaining and improving Trustee skills and education; and (x) experience in corporate governance and best business practices. Each Governance and Nominating Committee will also consider the diversity of the applicable Board's composition as part of the selection and nomination process. In considering the selection and nomination of the Independent Trustee candidate, it is expected that each Governance and Nominating Committee will consult with the Interested Trustee of the Fund and such other persons as the Governance and Nominating Committee deems appropriate. 
While each Governance and Nominating Committee is solely responsible for the selection and nomination of the applicable Fund's Trustees, each Governance and Nominating Committee shall review and consider nominations for the office of Trustee made by management and by Fund shareholders who have sent nominations (which includes the information required by the Fund's By-Laws) to the Secretary of the Funds, as the Trustees deem appropriate. Nominee recommendations should be submitted to the Fund at its mailing address stated in the Fund's prospectus and should be directed to the attention of such Fund's Governance and Nominating Committee. Each Fund will furnish, without charge, a copy of its By-Laws to any Shareholder requesting such By-Laws. Requests for the Fund's By-Laws should be made in writing to the Fund, c/o Goldman Sachs Funds, P.O. Box 06050, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6306.  Compliance Committee 
Each Compliance Committee has been established for the purpose of overseeing the compliance processes: (i) of the applicable Fund; and (ii) insofar as they relate to services provided to the applicable Fund, of the Fund's investment adviser, principal underwriter, administrator (if any), and transfer agent, except that compliance processes relating to the accounting and financial reporting processes, and certain related matters, are overseen by such Fund's Audit Committee. In addition, each Compliance Committee provides assistance to the full Board with respect to compliance matters. All of the Independent Trustees serve on the Compliance Committee. Each Compliance Committee met five times during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. 
Contract Review Committee 
Each Contract Review Committee has been established for the purpose of overseeing the processes of the applicable Board for reviewing and monitoring performance under such Fund's investment management, transfer agency, and certain other agreements with the Fund's Investment Adviser and its affiliates. Each Contract Review Committee is also responsible for overseeing such Board's processes for considering and reviewing performance under the operation of the Fund's service, shareholder administration and other plans, and any agreements related to the plans. Each Contract Review Committee also provides appropriate assistance to such Board in connection with the Board's approval, oversight and review of the Fund's other service providers including, without limitation, the Fund's custodian/accounting agent, sub-transfer agents, professional (legal and accounting) firms and printing firms. All of the Independent Trustees serve on the Contract Review Committee. The Contract Review Committee met one time during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018. 
Shareholder Communications 
Shareholders may send communications to each Board. Shareholders should send written communications intended for a Board by addressing the communication to the individual Trustee, c/o Goldman Sachs Funds, P.O. Box 06050, Chicago, Illinois 60606-6306. 
Risk Oversight 
The Boards are responsible for the oversight of the activities of their respective Funds, including oversight of risk management. Day-to-day risk management with respect to the Funds is the responsibility of GSAM, or other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk) subject to supervision by GSAM. The risks of the Funds include, but are not limited to, investment risk, compliance risk, operational risk, reputational risk, credit risk and counterparty risk. Each of GSAM and the other service providers have their own independent interest in risk management and their policies and methods of risk management may differ from the Funds and each other's in the setting of priorities, the resources available or the effectiveness of relevant controls. As a result, the Boards recognize that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Funds or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects, and that some risks are simply beyond the control of the Fund or GSAM, its affiliates or other service providers. 
Each Board effectuates its oversight role primarily through regular and special meetings of the Board and Board committees. In certain cases, risk management issues are specifically addressed in presentations and discussions. For example, GSAM has an independent dedicated Market Risk Group that assists GSAM in managing investment risk. Representatives from the Market Risk Group regularly meet with the Boards to discuss their analysis and methodologies. In addition, investment risk is discussed in the context of regular presentations to each Board on Fund strategy and performance. Other types of risk are addressed as part of presentations on related topics (e.g. compliance policies) or in the context of presentations focused specifically on one or more risks. Each Board also receives reports from GSAM management on operational risks, reputational risks and counterparty risks relating to the Fund.  Board oversight of risk management is also performed by various Board committees. For example, each Audit Committee meets with both the applicable Fund's Management and GSAM's internal audit group to review risk controls in place that support the Fund as well as test results, and each Compliance Committee meets with the Chief Compliance Officer and representatives of GSAM's compliance group to review testing results of the Fund's compliance policies and procedures and other compliance issues. Board oversight of risk is also performed as needed between meetings through communications between GSAM and the Boards. Each Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. Each Board's oversight role does not make the Board a guarantor of such Fund's investments or activities. 
Board Compensation 
Each Independent Trustee is compensated with an annual fee for his or her services as a Trustee of a Fund and as a member of such Fund's Governance and Nominating Committee, Compliance Committee, Contract Review Committee and Audit Committee. The Chairman and "audit committee financial expert" receive additional compensation for their services. The Independent Trustees are also reimbursed for travel expenses incurred in connection with attending meetings. Each Fund may also pay the incidental costs of a Trustee to attend training or other types of conferences relating to the investment company industry. 
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the compensation of each Trustee of the Funds for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2018:

 INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
At a meeting of each Board of Trustees held on November 28, 2018, each Audit Committee selected and recommended, and the Boards, including a majority of the Independent Trustees, approved, the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to act as independent registered public accountant for each Fund for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2019. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP determined that, as of the Record Date, there were certain borrowing relationships between "covered persons" of the auditor (as that term is defined in Rule 2-01(f)(11) of Regulation S-X) and certain lenders who are record owners of more than 10% of the shares of each Fund, and that these relationships implicate Rule 2-01(c)(1)(ii)(A) of Regulation S-X (the "Loan Rule"). The Loan Rule provides, in relevant part, that an accounting firm generally would not be independent if it or its covered persons receive a loan from a lender that is a "record or beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the audit client's equity securities." PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has represented that, after evaluating the facts and circumstances and the applicable independence rules, the independent auditor has concluded that these lending relationships do not and will not impair the independent auditor's ability to exercise objective and impartial judgment in connection with the audits of the financial statements for the Funds, and a reasonable investor with knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances would conclude that the independent auditor has been and is capable of objective and impartial judgment on all issues encompassed within its audit engagements with regard to the Funds. If a subsequent determination is made that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's objectivity and impartiality has been impaired with respect to the planning for and execution of the Fund's audit, then the Fund may no longer be able to continue to utilize PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Fund's auditor and would need to obtain audit services from a different independent registered public accounting firm. 
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are not expected to be present at the Meeting but will be available by telephone to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders if necessary. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be given the opportunity to make statements at the Meeting, if they so desire.

This includes any non-audit services required to be pre-approved or non-audit services that did not require pre-approval since they did not directly relate to the Funds' operations or financial reporting. 
Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services Provided to the Funds 
The Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the "Policy") adopted by each Audit Committee of the Boards of Trustees of the Funds sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which services performed by an independent auditor for the Funds may be pre-approved. Services may be pre-approved specifically by each Audit Committee as a whole or, in certain circumstances, by the Audit Committee Chairman or the person designated as the audit committee financial expert. In addition, subject to specified cost limitations,   certain services may be pre-approved under the provisions of the Policy. The Policy provides that each Audit Committee will consider whether the services provided by an independent auditor are consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on auditor independence. The Policy provides for periodic review and pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the services that may be provided by the independent auditor. 
De Minimis Waiver. The pre-approval requirements of the Policy may be waived with respect to the provision of non-audit services that are permissible for an independent auditor to perform, provided (1) the aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues subject to pre-approval that was paid to the independent auditors during the fiscal year in which the services are provided; (2) such services were not recognized by the Funds at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (3) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Audit Committee or by one or more members of the Audit Committee to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the Audit Committee, pursuant to the pre-approval provisions of the Policy. 
Pre-Approval of Non-Audit Services Provided to the Funds' Investment Advisers. The Policy provides that, in addition to requiring pre-approval of audit and non-audit services provided to the Funds, the Audit Committee will pre-approve those non-audit services provided to the Fund's investment adviser (and entities controlling, controlled by or under common control with the investment adviser that provide ongoing services to the Funds) where the engagement relates directly to the operations or financial reporting of the Funds. 
Each Audit Committee has considered these fees and the nature of the services rendered, and has concluded that they are compatible with maintaining the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Each Audit Committee did not approve any of the audit-related, tax, or other non-audit fees described above pursuant to the "de minimis exceptions" set forth in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) and Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP did not provide any audit-related services, tax services or other non-audit services to GSAM or any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with GSAM that provides ongoing services to the Funds that the Audit Committee was required to approve pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X. Each Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit services rendered to GSAM and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with GSAM that provides ongoing services to the Funds that were not pre-approved by the Audit Committee because the engagement did not relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Funds is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence. 
VOTE REQUIRED FOR THE ELECTION OF THE TRUSTEES AND 
APPROVAL OF OTHER MATTERS AT THE MEETING 
A quorum for the transaction of business at the Meeting is established by the presence, in person or by proxy, of holders representing a majority or more of the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting, but any lesser number will be sufficient to attain a quorum for the purpose of voting on adjournment (as further detailed below). 
Provided a quorum is present, the election of the Nominees of the Funds (Proposal 1) shall be decided by a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote thereon present in person or by proxy. Cumulative voting is not permitted. If a proxy card is properly executed and returned accompanied by instructions to withhold authority, the shares represented thereby will be considered to be present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but will not be counted in favor of Proposal 1. 
Brokers who hold shares in street name for customers generally have discretionary authority to vote on "routine" proposals, such as the election of Trustees, when they have not received instructions from the beneficial owners of those shares. Broker "non-votes" are shares held in an account with an Authorized Institution for which the broker indicates that instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or   other persons entitled to vote, and for which the broker does not have discretionary voting authority. Both abstentions and broker non-votes will be treated as shares that are present, and thereby included for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Meeting, but will not be treated as a vote cast. Broker non-votes (which are treated as shares present but not entitled to vote) will have no effect on Proposal 1. Abstentions (which are treated as shares present and entitled to vote) will have the same effect as a vote "against" Proposal 1. 
If at the time the Meeting is called to order a quorum is not present in person or by proxy, or if a quorum is present but sufficient votes in favor of a Proposal have not been received, the Meeting may be adjourned to a later date by the chairman of the meeting, or by a vote of shareholders. In the event of a shareholder vote on adjournment, any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of a Fund present in person or by proxy at the session of the Meeting to be adjourned. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies which they are entitled to vote in favor of such Proposal in favor of such an adjournment, and will vote those proxies required to be voted against such Proposal against any such adjournment. Broker non-votes will have no effect on adjournment, but abstentions effectively will be a vote "against" adjournment. Subject to the foregoing, the Meeting may be adjourned and re-adjourned without further notice to shareholders. However, if, after adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to Shareholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting.

Goldman Sachs Listed Closed-End Funds1 Audit Committee Charter 
Organization and Purpose 
The Board of Trustees (the "Board") of the Fund has established an Audit Committee (the "Committee"), comprised of each of the Fund's Independent Trustees. Independent Trustees are those Trustees who meet the independence standards set forth in the Fund's Governance and Nominating Committee Charter and who do not receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Fund except compensation for service as a member of the Board or a committee of the Board. 
The Committee has been established by and among the Trustees for the purpose of, among other things as set forth below, assisting the Board with oversight of (1) the integrity of the Fund's financial statements, (2) the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (3) the independent auditor's qualifications and independence, (4) the performance of the Fund's internal audit function and independent auditor, and (5) preparation of the Audit Committee report required to be included in the Fund's proxy statement. 
Each member of the Committee must be financially literate, or become financially literate within a reasonable period of time after his or her appointment to the Committee, as such qualification is interpreted by the Fund's Board in its business judgment. The Committee's composition shall meet such other regulatory requirements relating to audit committees established from time to time by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and any other applicable governmental entity or self-regulatory organization or law to which the Fund is subject. The Board, with the assistance of the Committee, shall determine whether any member of the Committee is an "audit committee financial expert" ("ACFE") as defined by the applicable regulations of the SEC, and the Board may presume that the ACFE satisfies the financial literacy requirement. The Committee will select one of its members to be its chair. If a member simultaneously serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies, the Board must determine that such simultaneous service will not impair the ability of such member to effectively serve on the Committee, and must disclose such determination either on or through the Fund's website, in its annual proxy statement, or in the Fund's annual report.2 
The Committee will set its agenda and the places and times of its meetings. The greater of one-third or two members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum. Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the Committee shall act by a vote of a majority of the Committee members at a Committee meeting, including a meeting held by conference telephone, teleconference or other electronic media or communication equipment, or by written consent of a majority of the Committee members without a meeting. Any written consent or waiver may be provided and delivered to the Committee chair by e-mail, facsimile or other similar electronic mechanism. 
Statement of Policy 
The Committee shall oversee the audit process and provide assistance to the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities in overseeing financial reporting. The Committee will also assist the Board with the oversight of the Fund's compliance with regulatory requirements that relate to the fund accounting and financial reporting, internal control over financial reporting and independent audits. In so doing, the Committee will endeavor to facilitate free and open means of communication among the Fund's Trustees, independent registered public

 accounting firm (the "independent auditor"), and management. A primary objective of the Committee is to help set the "tone at the top" for quality financial reporting and a sound system of internal controls over financial reporting. The Committee will regularly report its activities, observations, and recommendations to the Board. The Committee's activities and effectiveness will be assessed periodically and reviewed with the Board. 
Summary of Responsibilities 
The function of the Committee is oversight. Management of the Fund ("Management") is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Fund's financial statements. Management draws upon different parts of the Goldman Sachs corporate structure in fulfilling this role — the Controllers department (within the Finance Division) and the Operations Division (working in conjunction with GSAM Global Fund Services) are responsible for applying appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and maintaining policies and internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and applicable laws and regulations. In fulfilling its role under this Charter, Management also delegates certain functions to the Fund's accounting agents, but remains responsible for those functions. The independent auditor for the Fund is responsible for planning and executing audits consistent with applicable professional standards and in accordance with the terms of the engagement letter(s). The independent auditor will report directly to the Committee. The Committee shall provide for appropriate funding for the payment of compensation to the independent auditor, any other counsel or advisors engaged by the Committee at its discretion, and the ordinary administrative expenses of the Committee as necessary or appropriate in carrying out its duties. 
The Committee performs its functions under this Audit Committee Charter on the basis of information provided or representations made to it by the Fund's independent auditor, Management, and/or other service providers, and/or by legal counsel and/or other experts or consultants. Nothing in this Charter is intended to impose, or should be interpreted as imposing, on any member of the Committee (including any member designated as an ACFE) any additional duties or responsibilities over and above those placed on the member in his or her capacity as a Board member of the Fund under applicable federal and state law. 
Subject to regulatory mandates, the policies and procedures of the Committee should remain flexible in order to react to changing conditions and to assist the Committee in providing assurance to the Board and shareholders that the Fund's accounting and reporting practices are in accordance with applicable requirements. 
The following are the duties and responsibilities of the Committee: 
Primarily Related to the Independent Auditor 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Evaluate and select (subject to ratification by the Board) the Fund's independent auditor.

As part  of its evaluation of the independence of the auditor, the Committee may inquire into and consider the opinions of Management and Internal Audit (or other personnel responsible for the internal audit function), and may consider such items as:  (1) the audit and non-audit services performed by the auditor and related fees; (2) the hiring of partners or employees or former partners or employees of the auditor by the Fund and its affiliates;  (3) whether any non-audit services provided by the auditor to the Fund investment adviser(s) or any adviser affiliate that provides ongoing services to the Fund are compatible with maintaining the  auditors' independence; (4) the rotation of the auditor(s') partners who participate in providing auditing services to the Fund and (5) other relationships, if any, between the Fund and the auditor that may bear on the  independence or objectivity of the auditor.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    7.  Set policies governing the hiring by entities within the Fund's Investment Company Complex3 of any current or former employee of the Fund's independent auditors, and to assess compliance with these policies.

EXHIBIT B 
Governance and Nominating Committee Charter 
Goldman Sachs Closed-End Funds1 
Organization and Purpose 
The Board of Trustees (the "Board") of each of Goldman Sachs Closed-End Funds (all such funds, the "Closed-End Funds" or the "Funds") has established a Governance and Nominating Committee (the "Committee"), comprising all of the Funds' Independent Trustees. "Independent Trustees" are those Trustees who: (a) are independent of the management of Goldman, Sachs & Co.; (b) are not "interested persons" of the Funds or any investment adviser or principal underwriter of the Funds within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"); and (c) do not accept any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the Funds except in their capacities as members of the Board or committees thereof (Board and committee members serving the Funds in additional capacities, e.g., as Chairman of the Board or as Audit Committee Financial Expert, may receive additional compensation). The Committee has been established for the following purposes: (1) assisting the Board in matters involving fund governance and industry best practices; (2) with respect to the selection and nomination of Independent Trustees, satisfying certain regulatory requirements adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); and (3) advising the Board from time to time on ways to improve its effectiveness. 
Statement of Policy 
The mission of the Board is to represent and protect the interests of the Funds and their shareholders. In doing so, the Board has the legal responsibility for overseeing the affairs of the Funds. It is the policy of the Board that in fulfilling its mission and meeting its responsibilities, the Trustees will seek high standards of integrity, commitment and independence of thought and judgment in a manner that is consistent with best practices of mutual fund governance. 
Summary of Responsibilities 
The Committee will have the following responsibilities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Making recommendations to the Board with respect to the effectiveness of the Board in carrying out its  responsibilities in governing the Funds and overseeing their management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Monitoring the governance policies set forth in the Trustee Charter adopted by the Board, and recommending such  changes to those policies as the Committee deems appropriate from time to time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Making recommendations to the Board regarding its size, structure and composition as well as qualifications for  Board membership.

[BEGIN TABLE]
1   This charter shall apply to any listed closed-end management investment company (a "Fund") managed by  Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (the "Adviser") or an affiliated person of GSAM, as listed in Schedule A of this charter.  
[END TABLE]
B-1

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  10.  Selecting and nominating candidates for election or appointment as  non-interested members of the Board as discussed below.  
[END TABLE]
In carrying out its responsibilities under this Charter, the policies and procedures of the Committee should remain flexible in order to best react to changing conditions and to provide assurance to the full Board and shareholders that the Funds' governance practices are in accordance with applicable requirements and are of the highest quality. 
The Committee performs its functions under this Governance and Nominating Committee Charter (the "Charter") on the basis of information or advice provided or representations made to it by the management of the Funds, or by service providers, or by legal counsel or other experts or consultants, without independent verification. Nothing in this Charter is intended to impose, or should be interpreted as imposing, on any member of the Committee any additional duties or responsibilities over and above those placed on the member in his or her capacity as a Trustee of the Funds under applicable federal and state law. 
Selection and Nomination of Independent Trustees 
The Committee will be responsible for the selection and nomination of the candidates for election or appointment as independent Trustees of the Funds. In connection with the selection and nomination of candidates to the Board, the Committee will evaluate the qualifications of candidates for Board membership and their independence from each Fund's respective investment adviser, principal underwriter(s), and other principal service providers. Persons selected must be independent under the provisions of the 1940 Act. The Committee will also consider the effect of any relationships beyond those delineated in the 1940 Act that might impair independence (for example, business, financial or family relationships with the investment adviser or other service providers). Candidates should have the capacity to address financial and legal issues and to exercise reasonable business judgment. Without limiting the foregoing, the Committee will also consider, among other criteria, a candidate's: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  experience in business, financial or investment matters or in other fields of endeavor;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  financial literacy and/or whether he or she is an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in  Item 3 of Form N-CSR (for the Closed-End Fund only);

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (h)  commitment to the representation of the interests of the Funds and their shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  commitment to maintaining and improving Trustee skills and education; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (j)  experience in corporate governance and best business practices.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee will also consider the diversity of the Board's composition as part of the selection and nomination process. 
In considering the selection and nomination of independent Trustee candidates, it is expected that the Committee will consult with the interested Trustees and Officers of the Funds and such other persons as the Committee deems appropriate. 
B-2 
While the Committee is solely responsible for the selection and nomination of the Funds' Trustees, the Committee shall review and consider nominations for the office of Trustee made by management and by Trust shareholders who have sent nominations (which include, in the case of the Closed-End Funds, the information required by the Closed-End Funds' By-Laws, and, in the case of GST II, the biographical information and qualifications of the proposed nominee) to the Secretary of the Funds, as the Trustees deem appropriate. 
Additional Matters
