MSCI Inc. 
(Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter) 
(Name of Person(s) Filing Proxy Statement, if Other Than the Registrant) 
Payment of Filing Fee (Check the appropriate box): 
Dear Fellow Shareholders, 
Our directors work together to continually assess whether the Board of Directors (the "Board") of MSCI Inc. ("MSCI" or the "Company") is performing effectively and efficiently, and evolving its culture and practices to have the greatest impact on long-term value creation. As we approach the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders (the "2019 Annual Meeting"), we would like to share with you, on behalf of our fellow directors, some of the Board's priorities and actions during this past year. 
Driving Sound Business Strategy 
During a year of volatility in international markets and a heightened level of uncertainty in the U.S. markets over the last several months, the Company continued to deliver strong financial results reflecting the resiliency of MSCI's franchise. Through such times, it is more important than ever for the Board to be informed, active and constructively engaged with management. In 2018, the Board provided critical insights on executing and developing a sound strategy by, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• engaging in robust discussion of long-term strategic objectives at our annual multi-day strategy session, which focused on growth opportunities and risks that could challenge the successful execution of our strategic objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• receiving regular updates on, and discussing, key strategic initiatives at quarterly Board meetings,  including those related to innovation, product development and our technology transformation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• inviting clients and shareholders to present at quarterly Board meetings to give directors access to  the perspectives that are vital to MSCI's success and engaging in discussions focused on trends in the investment industry, the competitive landscape, our shareholders' investment theses and client needs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing our capital allocation strategy to ensure that it generates sufficient shareholder value  through internal investments accompanied by the return of excess capital through share repurchases and dividends. In 2018, the Company divested two non-core product lines and returned $1.1 billion to  shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  
[END TABLE]
Building a Board with Diverse Perspectives 
The Board, through its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Governance Committee"), is continuously evaluating potential director candidates to ensure that we have strong leaders who bring diverse perspectives, skills and experiences and balance new perspectives and ideas with institutional knowledge. In addition to rotating the chairs of all of its NYSE-mandated committees and its Lead Director in 2018, in the past few years, the Company has seen a number of changes to our Board's composition. 
In 2017, Jacques P. Perold and Marcus L. Smith were appointed to the Board. Each of them bring valuable experience from long careers in the investment industry, and their insights into our competitive landscape and clients made them strong candidates for our Strategy and Finance Committee (the "Strategy Committee") where they currently provide valuable advice on the Company's long-term strategy. 
In 2018, we said farewell to two of our fellow directors— Rodolphe M. Vallee ("Skip") and Patrick Tierney. Skip served on the Board for over 10 years and as the Lead Director for over eight of those years. Having joined the Board shortly after MSCI's IPO and in his role as Lead Director, Skip was integral to building a Board with a diverse and broad set of skills and experiences, strengthening our risk management program and developing the Board's operating framework, including forging an effective collaboration between the Board and senior management. During Pat's nearly eight-year tenure, the Board benefitted from his valuable expertise and counsel on various aspects of managing a complex and global business, including with respect to M&A transactions, and from his service on the Compensation & Talent Management Committee ("Compensation Committee"), where he has advised management on fostering the performance culture that has been central to the successful execution of our strategy and helped position MSCI for the next phase of its transformation. In addition, Wendy E. Lane, who has served as a director since 2015, has chosen not to stand for re-election in 2019. We thank Wendy for her service, and for her valuable contributions to the development of our business strategy and performance-aligned compensation plans. 
Creating Value Through Our Executive Compensation Program 
Ensuring that the Company has an executive compensation program that appropriately attracts, retains and incentivizes our management is one of the Board's most critical responsibilities. In 2016, the Compensation Committee designed and adopted a pay-for-performance program that has helped deliver $7.9 billion1 in value creation to shareholders. In anticipation of the conclusion of the performance period for the 2016 executive compensation program, during 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Compensation Committee undertook a comprehensive process, including engaging with shareholders, to refine the Company's executive compensation program. In response to shareholder feedback, the structure of the equity award program adopted in 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued to focus on the alignment of long-term executive pay outcomes with shareholder returns  through the use of absolute total shareholder return compound annual growth rate ("TSR CAGR") as a performance metric for performance stock units;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued to structure the equity component of Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") pay to be  100% performance-based;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• eliminated the relative TSR CAGR performance metric for performance stock units; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• eliminated the "re-test" or extended performance period for performance stock units.   
[END TABLE]
Additionally, we strengthened our Clawback Policy to cover a broader range of detrimental conduct that results in a negative financial impact to the Company and/or reputational harm and financial restatements (even in the absence of detrimental conduct). We also increased our minimum stock ownership requirements for the members of our Executive Committee. 
We believe these changes effectively cultivate an "owner-operator" mindset among our senior executives, reward performance and drive long-term value creation for our shareholders, and are aligned with our strategic objectives. You can read more about these changes starting on page 47 of this proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement"). 
Strengthening Our Commitment to Corporate Responsibility 
The Board supports MSCI in the pursuit of its mission to power better investment decisions for a better world. The belief that sound environmental, social and governance ("ESG") practices are linked to better business results not only underpins a key element of our business strategy, but also reflects how MSCI operates. To ensure guidance and support of MSCI's corporate responsibility initiatives at the highest levels, the Governance Committee is now responsible for overseeing the Company's ESG practices and policies and receives a periodic update from the Company's Chief Responsibility Officer ("CRO"), a position that was created in 2018. The CRO leads a Corporate Responsibility Committee comprised of a cross-functional team of senior leaders at the Company who will work together to formalize the Company's ESG disclosure processes and reevaluate and make recommendations for evolving the Company's ESG practices. Additionally, the Compensation Committee helps to develop and oversee many of MSCI's social programs and practices, including talent management, employee engagement and diversity and inclusion. The Board is dedicated to ensuring transparency and integrity when it comes to the policies and practices that are meaningful to MSCI's customers, shareholders and employees. You can learn more about our commitment to ESG by visiting our corporate responsibility page (www.msci.com/corporate-responsibility) and corporate governance page (http://ir.msci.com/corporate-governance).

Your vote is very important to us. We strongly encourage you to read both our Proxy Statement and annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K") in their entirety, and ask that you vote with our recommendations. You can communicate with the Board at any time (see page A-7 of this Proxy Statement for instructions).

I cordially invite you to attend the MSCI 2019 Annual Meeting to be held via the internet through a virtual web conference at www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/MSCI2019 on April 25, 2019 at 2:30 P.M. Eastern Time, and any adjournments or postponements thereof. You will be able to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting online, vote your shares electronically and submit questions online during the meeting by logging in to the website listed above using the 16-digit control number included in your Notice of Internet Availability of the proxy materials, on your proxy card or on any additional voting instructions form accompanying these proxy materials. 
We have adopted this technology to expand access to the meeting, improve communications and lower the cost to our shareholders, the Company and the environment. In the past, in-person shareholders' meetings were only attended by a few shareholders. We believe virtual meetings enable increased shareholder participation from locations around the world. Additionally, the online format allows us to communicate more effectively via a pre-meeting forum that you can enter by visiting www.proxyvote.com with your control number. We recommend that you log in a few minutes before the meeting to ensure you are logged in when the meeting starts. 
The meeting is being convened for the following purposes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  To elect 10 members to our Board;  
2.  To approve, by non-binding vote, our executive compensation, as described  in these proxy materials;  
3.  To ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent registered public  accounting firm ("independent auditor"); and  
4.  To transact such other business as may properly come before our 2019 Annual Meeting and any adjournments or  postponements thereof.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the election of the directors, the approval, on an advisory basis, of our executive compensation and the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditor. 
We are once again pleased to furnish our proxy materials over the internet pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules. As a result, we are mailing to many of our shareholders the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials contains instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement (including the proxy card) and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K over the internet, how to request a paper or email copy of these materials and how to vote by mail or via the internet. We believe that posting the proxy materials on the internet expedites shareholders' receipt of the information that they need, while lowering our costs of printing and delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our annual meeting of shareholders. 
Our Board has fixed the close of business on February 27, 2019 as the record date for determining the shareholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, our 2019 Annual Meeting. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will be mailed to our shareholders of record beginning on or about March 11, 2019. These proxy materials are being made available beginning on or about March 11, 2019. 
As a shareholder of MSCI, your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend our 2019 Annual Meeting, it is important that you vote as soon as possible to ensure that your shares are represented. For information on how to vote by mail, telephone, or via the internet, please refer to the question "How do I vote my shares?" in Annex A, or instructions in the Proxy Statement Summary, the proxy card, or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials distributed to you on or about March 11, 2019. 
Thank you for your support of MSCI. 
Sincerely, 
Henry A. Fernandez 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY              
[END TABLE]
Aligning Executive Compensation with Company Strategy and Performance 
We believe our executive compensation program was integral to our successful financial performance in 2018. To align the interests and compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs") with the long-term interests of our shareholders and to further drive the performance culture that is key to successfully delivering on our corporate strategy, MSCI's executive compensation program emphasizes performance-based compensation in the form of equity grants under our Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") and the payment of cash incentives under our Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP"). 
LTIP 
In 2016, we granted multi-year performance stock units ("PSUs") to each of our NEOs employed at that time that covered a three-year performance cycle that ended on February 8, 2019 (the "2016 Multi-Year PSUs"). Because the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs operated on an end-to-end basis without overlapping cycles or additional grants of PSUs during the performance cycle, no additional PSUs were awarded to our NEOs in 2017 or 2018. The 2016 Multi-Year PSUs were subject to a challenging multi-year absolute TSR CAGR performance metric. 
Our NEOs, other than our CEO, continued to receive annual grants of restricted stock units ("RSUs") in 2017 and 2018. Mr. Fernandez's LTIP award was granted entirely in the form of PSUs and, as such, he did not receive any additional equity awards in 2016, 2017 and 2018. The awards granted under the LTIP in 2018 for each of our NEOs are further detailed in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 on page 74. See the table on page 45 of this Proxy Statement, which reflects the annualized portion of the target value of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs attributable to 2018 (i.e., one-third of the total target value of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs). 
In 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted enhancements to the Company's LTIP which are designed to (i) prioritize shareholder value creation and (ii) facilitate an "owner-operator" mindset among our senior executives, both of which were also primary goals of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs. The 2019 LTIP comprises a mix of the following:

 Annual grant of RSUs to our NEOs (other than our CEO) that will service-vest in three  equal installments in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022.   Our CEO was  not granted any RSUs in 2019 and received all of his long-term incentive equity in the form of PSUs.    Annual grant of PSUs which will cover a three-year  performance cycle (the "3-Year PSUs") from February 6, 2019 to February 5, 2022.   The 3-Year PSUs are subject to vest between 0% and 300% based on the achievement of an absolute TSR CAGR  performance metric.    Annual grant of PSUs which will cover a five-year performance cycle (the "5-Year PSUs") from February 6, 2019 to February 5, 2024.   The 5-Year PSUs are subject to vest between 0% and 200% based on the achievement of an absolute TSR CAGR  performance metric.

In addition, in response to feedback from shareholders in the meetings described below, the Compensation Committee determined that, under the 2019 LTIP, it would no longer consider relative TSR CAGR or use an extended performance assessment period when determining actual achievement of the absolute TSR CAGR goals in the 3- and 5-year PSUs. These changes provide for an even more rigorous performance assessment and increase the "at-risk" element of the LTIP.

             PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
[END TABLE]
In 2019, our CEO received 100% of his equity compensation in the form of 3-Year PSUs and 5-Year PSUs. Granting a majority of our CEO's LTIP in the form of PSUs has been previously viewed favorably by our shareholders. 
For additional information about the 2019 LTIP program, please see page 63 of this Proxy Statement. 
AIP 
The AIP closely aligns the interests of our NEOs with those of shareholders by using a formulaic approach based on specific annual financial criteria and individual key performance indicators ("KPIs") when determining annual cash incentives. The Compensation Committee regularly assesses the metrics and weighting of those metrics, in addition to shareholder feedback, to ensure that the AIP reflects the appropriate metrics and proper balance of those metrics necessary to deliver the annual growth that will serve as the foundation for longer-term value creation. In 2018, in response to shareholder feedback, the Compensation Committee expanded the inclusion of Adjusted EPS to the product-level grids, rather than only including it in the corporate-level grid, because Adjusted EPS is a primary measure used by many of our shareholders in assessing our ongoing performance. 
Actual cash incentives paid to our NEOs for 2018 were higher than their target values based on actual performance against the applicable financial metrics and their KPIs due to our strong financial performance and the performance of our NEOs in 2018. See the table on page 63 of this Proxy Statement for the actual amounts paid. 
CEO COMPENSATION 
Since our 2018 "Say-on-Pay" proposal to approve our executive compensation program (the "Say-on-Pay Vote") (for which 98.9% of the votes cast were voted in support of the compensation of our NEOs), the Compensation Committee's actions with respect to our CEO's compensation were solely to (i) pay Mr. Fernandez an annual cash bonus in respect of 2018 of $1.8 million under our AIP, based on actual performance against the applicable financial metrics and his KPIs and (ii) increase his LTIP target for 2019 by 10.1% (based on an annualized value of his LTIP target in 2018). The increase took into account the fact that Mr. Fernandez's LTIP awards will continue to be granted solely in the form of PSUs and the fact that his LTIP contained the greatest "at-risk" component as a result of receiving a higher percentage of 5-Year PSUs than any other NEO. As reflected in the table on page 46 of this Proxy Statement, on an annualized basis, Mr. Fernandez's 2018 compensation (which, along with the compensation of the other NEOs, is the subject of this year's Say-on-Pay vote) increased by only 4.2% relative to 2017. Such increase was attributable to the increased payout of his annual cash bonus for 2018 based on actual performance against the applicable financial metrics and KPIs due to our strong financial performance and his performance in 2018 and an increase in base salary. Mr. Fernandez had not received an increase in base salary since 2014 and did not receive an increase in base salary in 2019. 
ENHANCED CLAWBACK POLICY 
Effective February 7, 2019, the Company's Clawback Policy was enhanced to be more rigorous and cover a broader range of detrimental conduct and financial restatements. Under the enhanced Clawback Policy, the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, recoup any incentive compensation (cash and equity) received by members of the Executive Committee and the Company's Principal Accounting Officer, in the event of (1) a restatement of the Company's financial statements, (2) a restatement or adjustment of the achievement of applicable performance metrics, (3) detrimental conduct that has impacted the achievement of applicable performance metrics and (4) detrimental conduct that causes material financial or reputational harm. For additional details regarding our enhanced Clawback Policy, see page 71 of this Proxy Statement.

INCREASED STOCK OWNERSHIP REQUIREMENTS 
As part of the Compensation Committee's ongoing assessment of the Company's compensation policies and practices to ensure furtherance of the goals identified above and for alignment with best practices, effective January 1, 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted more rigorous stock ownership guidelines. The ownership requirements for the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer ("COO") were increased from 3x base salary to 4x base salary and the ownership requirements for the rest of the Company's Executive Committee members (other than our CEO) increased from 2x base salary to 3x base salary. Our CEO's ownership requirements remained at 6x base salary. For more information on the changes to the stock ownership guidelines, refer to page 70 of this Proxy Statement. 
SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
As noted above, in 2018, 98.9% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay Vote were voted in support of the compensation of our NEOs. Due to the structure of the executive compensation program in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Compensation Committee was not in a position in 2017 or 2018 to incorporate feedback we received from our shareholders regarding the PSU component of our LTIP program until early 2019 (when the performance period applicable to the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs concluded). 
While none of the shareholders we spoke with expressed any significant concerns regarding the Compensation Committee's compensation decisions in 2018, which are the subject of this year's Say-on-Pay Vote, the conclusion of the performance period for the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs presented the Compensation Committee with the opportunity to incorporate feedback received from our shareholders on our LTIP when designing our 2019 LTIP (as described above), which will be the subject of the 2020 Say-on-Pay Vote. 
The Company will continue to maintain an active dialogue with shareholders and evaluate feedback on issues of importance to them, including the metrics that drive each of our NEO's long-term incentive compensation. Our engagement with shareholders on executive compensation is further described on page 51 of this Proxy Statement.

12• MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT 
Proposal No. 1 - Election of Directors 
Our Board currently has 11 directors. Each director stands for election at each annual meeting of shareholders and holds office until his or her successor has been duly elected and qualified or the director's earlier resignation, death or removal. All of the nominees presented below are directors of MSCI as of March 11, 2019. All directors were elected at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. The Board believes that each of the nominees brings strong skills and experience to the Board, giving the Board, as a group, the appropriate skills needed to exercise its oversight responsibilities and advise management with respect to the Company's strategic initiatives. 
On March 5, 2019, Wendy E. Lane informed the Company of her decision to not stand for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Her term as a director will end when her current term expires at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Concurrent with the 2019 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be decreased from 11 to 10.

We believe that it is in the best interests of MSCI and its shareholders to combine the roles of Chairman and CEO at this time because it provides the Company with continued unified leadership and direction. We believe Mr. Fernandez is best situated to serve as Chairman because he is the director most knowledgeable about the Company's products, services and industry, and is in a position to effectively identify strategic priorities, recommend appropriate agendas and lead the execution of our strategy. While the Company's independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from

[END TABLE]
 various perspectives and disciplines, Mr. Fernandez's historical knowledge and in-depth understanding of the Company and its products and services enable him to identify areas of focus for the Board while effectively executing the Company's strategy. We also believe that combining the role of Chairman and CEO facilitates the flow of information between management and the Board, provides clear accountability and promotes efficient decision making, all of which are essential to effective governance. 
Additionally, our Board leadership structure is enhanced by the independent leadership provided by our Lead Director who provides effective independent oversight through his expansive list of enumerated duties. 
While we believe that continuing to combine the roles of Chairman and CEO is the most effective leadership structure for our Board and the Company at this time, our Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws") and Corporate Governance Policies also permit a structure where the CEO would not serve contemporaneously as the Chairman of the Board should the separation of such roles be deemed appropriate and in the best interests of MSCI and its shareholders in the future. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE         
Our Corporate Governance Policies provide that the Board should have a significant majority of independent directors meeting the independence requirements of the NYSE. Our Board has determined that each of Messrs. Ashe, duPont, Edmunds, Perold, Siguler and Smith, Mmes. Handy, Kinney and Riefler and Ms. Lane (who is not standing for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting but will remain on the Board through that date) is independent in accordance with the requirements of our Corporate Governance Policies, which follow the NYSE rules and guidelines. In making such determinations, there were no material transactions, relationships or arrangements not disclosed herein under "Other Matters—Certain Transactions" to be considered by the Board in determining whether the director was independent. Therefore, 10 of our 11 current directors are independent. Only Mr. Fernandez is not independent because of his position as CEO of MSCI. 
All members of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance Committee satisfy the independence requirements of the NYSE. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee meets the heightened independence standards of the NYSE required for audit committee and compensation committee members, respectively.

BOARD AND INDIVIDUAL DIRECTOR EVALUATIONS         
In addition to the ongoing assessment of the functioning of the Board, each year, our directors formally evaluate the effectiveness of the Board and its committees through a self-assessment administered by Board members and management. Directors respond to questions designed to elicit information that will be useful in improving Board and committee effectiveness. Such feedback is discussed during executive session and where appropriate, addressed with management. 
DIRECTOR EDUCATION         
All new directors participate in a director orientation program that includes in-person briefings by senior management representing the heads of the product lines and key functional areas, and topics include, among others: the Company's strategic plans, capital structure, historical financial performance and key policies and practices, including compliance and trading policies. New directors are also encouraged to attend all Committee meetings during their first year. Directors are encouraged and provided with opportunities to attend educational sessions on subjects that could assist them in discharging their duties. Pursuant to its Director Education Policy, the Company will reimburse directors for reasonable costs incurred from attending these sessions. In addition to external educational opportunities, directors participate in onsite educational sessions, including an annual review of leading corporate governance practices by corporate governance experts, briefing sessions on topics that present special risks and opportunities, updates on accounting topics, and product line reviews presented by the heads of each of our product segments.

SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT         
We believe that engaging with our shareholders is the best way to address the issues that matter most to them. Dialogue with our shareholders helps us understand their perspectives on the Company and its goals and expectations for performance and identify issues that might affect our long-term strategy, corporate governance and compensation practices. As such, we provide our shareholders with many opportunities to provide feedback to our Board and senior management, including by inviting certain shareholders to address the Board and present their views on the Company. We also engage with shareholders before, during and after the proxy season to present new governance practices or design features in our executive compensation program and receive feedback. 
In 2018 and early 2019, we held over 200 meetings with our shareholders, and in February 2019, hosted our first Investor Day in four years to provide existing and prospective shareholders with a deeper understanding of our key strategic initiatives, highlight the achievement of our financial performance over the last several years and provide an update to our long-term financial outlook. 
During these shareholder engagements, we typically discuss topics such as market trends affecting our industry, the competitive environment, our go-to-market strategy, financial performance and our overall outlook for the Company. 
Below are the highlights from our engagement efforts: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Participation by our CEO, President, Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), other members of  senior management and/or our Head of Investor Relations at 10 investor conferences and participation in seven non-deal related shareholder roadshows.

• Outreach to over 100 shareholders representing over 49% of our outstanding shares as of February 27,  2019, including direct calls and in-person meetings.

• Attendance by 40 shareholders (representing a total of 28% of our outstanding shares as of February  27, 2019) at our 2019 Investor Day where shareholders had the opportunity to hear senior management discuss important aspects of our business, financial performance and long-term strategy.  
[END TABLE]
Additionally, in response to shareholder interest in ESG practices, we enhanced the disclosures on our Corporate Responsibility webpage to provide additional information on the framework within which MSCI manages its ESG practices and initiatives, career development practices, employee management programs, compliance policies, and environmental and sustainability practices. Multiple corporate ESG objectives were also incorporated into our CEO's key performance indicators for 2019. 
Our directors and management recognize the benefits that come from providing our shareholders with visibility and transparency into our business, as well as knowing our shareholders' positions on issues that are important to them. We are committed to continuing to maintain an active dialogue with our shareholders. Please see pages 8 and 51 of this Proxy Statement for additional information on our shareholder engagement efforts specific to compensation matters. 
ATTENDANCE AT BOARD MEETINGS AND ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS         
Our Board met nine times, held independent director executive sessions following eight of those meetings and took action by unanimous written consent on one occasion during 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the total meetings of the Board and Committees on which the director served that were held while the director was a member.

Discussions between the Board and management on strategic direction, new business opportunities and the scope and mix of the Company's products were held at each quarterly Board meeting. In addition to formal meetings, members of our Board informally interact with senior management on a periodic basis. 
Our Corporate Governance Policies state that directors are expected to attend the annual meetings of shareholders. In 2018, all of our directors who were on the Board at the time attended our annual meeting of shareholders.

Cybersecurity 
On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee is updated on the Company's information security program and its related priorities and controls. As part of this update, the Audit Committee is provided with a written report on such topics that is also made available to the full Board. The Chair of the Audit Committee informs the Board of any key updates during his quarterly reports to the Board. 
DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS         
The Governance Committee's charter requires it to review candidates' qualifications for membership on the Board or a committee of the Board, including making a specific determination as to the independence of each candidate, based on the criteria approved by the Board (and taking into account the enhanced independence, financial literacy and financial expertise standards that may be required under applicable law or NYSE rules for audit committee membership purposes, and heightened independence standards that may be required under law for compensation committee membership purposes). If the Governance Committee determines that adding a new director is advisable, it will recommend such individual to the Board for appointment as a member of the Board and any Committees. 
Consistent with our Corporate Governance Policies, when appointing directors, the Board takes into account the diversity of a candidate's perspectives, background, and other demographics. Our diversity objectives are also implemented and monitored through periodic reviews by the Governance Committee of the composition of the Board and its Committees in light of the then-current challenges and needs of the Board, the Company and each Committee, which result in determinations as to whether it may be appropriate to make changes after considering issues of judgment, diversity, age, skills, background and experience. The composition of our current Board demonstrates the Board's commitment to diversity in a number of areas. Women represent approximately 30% of our current director nominees. Our directors also have differing backgrounds, educations, professional experiences, skills, ages, national origins and viewpoints. See "Proposal No. 1—Election of Directors." 
Pursuant to the authority granted in its charter, the Governance Committee retains professional search firms to assist in the process of identifying, evaluating and conducting due diligence on potential director candidates. Using a search firm provides additional assurance to the Governance Committee that it is conducting a broad search and looking at a diverse pool of potential candidates. 
TENURE AND BOARD REFRESHMENT         
Our Board has shown an ongoing commitment to Board refreshment and to having highly qualified, independent perspectives in the boardroom. Three of the Company's director nominees have been added to the Board since the beginning of 2015. The average tenure of the director nominees is currently 7.56 years. Also, under our Corporate Governance Policies, directors should not stand for re-election following their 72nd birthday.

SUCCESSION PLANNING         
One of the Board's primary responsibilities is to oversee the development and retention of executive talent and to ensure an appropriate succession plan is in place for our CEO and other members of senior management. The Compensation Committee oversees the process for succession planning for senior management positions from a talent management perspective. This includes ongoing reviews of our leadership bench and succession plans globally, with a focus on developing and retaining top talent at the senior management level, including the CEO. Additionally, high potential leaders are given exposure to Board members through formal presentations at Board or Committee meetings, one-on-one meetings with individual directors and participation in other Board activities. 
During 2018, the Board and the Compensation Committee met on several occasions, including from time to time with outside consultants, in furtherance of its succession planning and executive development initiatives, which are considered in the context of our strategic goals. In addition to an annual review of the CEO led by the Lead Director, the Compensation Committee holds a formal succession planning and talent review session annually, which includes succession planning for all senior management positions, including the CEO. All members of the Board are invited to attend this meeting and provide their input on the pipeline of qualified talent for critical roles. These talent review and succession planning discussions take into account desired leadership skills and experience in light of our current business and long-term strategy. For example, the Company is increasingly focused on technology, client services and the Asia Pacific ("APAC") region as part of its long-term strategic plan. In furtherance of its strategy, in 2018, the Company appointed Jigar Thakkar to serve as the Chief Technology Officer and Head of Engineering, Russell Read to serve as Global Head of Client Solutions and Jack Lin to serve as Head of APAC Client Coverage. Each of them was also appointed to the Executive Committee.

             CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[END TABLE]
An important part of cultivating talent at MSCI is ensuring that employees remain engaged. As such, the Compensation Committee is provided with updates on employee engagement. In 2018, the Company saw improved engagement of employees across the Company based on the Company's annual employee engagement survey. 
INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR MEETINGS         
Our Corporate Governance Policies provide that our Lead Director will preside over non-employee director sessions. The Lead Director presided over eight (8) independent director sessions during 2018. The Board's standing committees also have a practice of holding executive sessions after their quarterly meetings. Our Corporate Governance Policies further provide that if any non-employee directors are not independent, then the independent directors will meet at least once a year in an independent director session and the Lead Director will preside over such independent director sessions. During 2018, all non-employee directors were independent. 
COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE         
The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. As noted above, the Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving annually all compensation awarded to the Executives, including the CEO and the other NEOs presented in the Summary Compensation Table on page 74 of this Proxy Statement. Information on the Compensation Committee's processes, procedures and analysis of executive officer compensation for 2018 is provided in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section included herein. 
The Compensation Committee actively engages in its duties and follows procedures intended to ensure good compensation governance. See page 26 for additional information on the Compensation Committee's responsibilities. 
The principal compensation plans and arrangements applicable to our executive officers are described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and the executive compensation tables included herein. The Compensation Committee may delegate the administration of these plans as appropriate, including to one or more officers of the Company, subcommittees or to the Chair of the Compensation Committee, in each case, when it deems doing so to be appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and consistent with applicable law and NYSE requirements. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultant assisting the Compensation Committee in the evaluation of CEO or other executive officer compensation, including authority to approve such compensation consultant's fees and other retention terms. As further described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section included herein, during 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") as its own external compensation consultant to review CEO and other executive officer compensation. All of the services provided by Semler Brossy to the Compensation Committee during 2018 were to provide advice or recommendations on the amount or form of executive officer and director compensation, and Semler Brossy did not provide any additional services to the Company during 2018. The Compensation Committee has considered, among other things, the factors delineated in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act ("Rule 10C-1"), including the NYSE listing rules implementing Rule 10C-1 and Semler Brossy's conflict of interest policies, and determined that the engagement of Semler Brossy does not raise any conflict of interest or other factors that compromise the independence of its relationship with the Compensation Committee. In developing its views on compensation matters and determining the compensation awarded to our CEO and other executive officers, the Human Resources Department provides data and analyses to aid the Compensation Committee in its decisions. The CEO also makes recommendations on compensation 
MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT• 31 
[BEGIN TABLE]
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE              
[END TABLE]
 for executive officers other than himself and the Compensation Committee takes these recommendations into account in reaching its compensation decisions. From time to time, the Compensation Committee may obtain input from Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP ("Davis Polk") on compensation award documentation and other compensation-related practices, which in 2018 was communicated to the Compensation Committee via management, the Legal Department or the Human Resources Department. In light of this relationship, the Compensation Committee has considered, among other things, the factors delineated in Rule 10C-1, including the NYSE listing rules implementing Rule 10C-1 and Davis Polk's conflict of interest policies.

In addition to the annual retainer, non-employee directors were also entitled to the following cash retainers for serving as chairs and/or non-chair members of the Board's standing committees. Directors do not receive meeting fees and employee directors do not receive any separate compensation for their Board activities.

 Strategy and Finance Committee    $ 10,000   
 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee    $ 10,000   
[END TABLE]
Each non-employee director was also entitled to receive an annual equity award payable in RSUs having an aggregate fair market value of $160,000 for non-employee directors and $210,000 for the Lead Director based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by the NYSE on the date prior to grant. 
Directors may elect under the terms of the MSCI Inc. 2016 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (the "Directors Plan") to receive their cash retainer in the form of shares of our common stock. Under the Directors Plan, non-employee directors are subject to annual limits on their cash and equity compensation, as follows: non-employee directors may not receive in any calendar year (i) options, restricted stock, RSUs and other stock-based awards with a grant date fair value of more than $1,000,000 (as determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards) and (ii) retainers and other cash-based awards in excess of $1,000,000. 
MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT• 33 
[BEGIN TABLE]
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AND STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES              
[END TABLE]
RSUs granted to non-employee directors are granted on May 1st of each year and vest on the first anniversary of the grant date. Cash retainers and RSU awards are prorated when a director joins the Board and/or a committee at any time other than May 1st. RSUs not granted on May 1st vest on the next May 1st following the grant date. For example, if a director joins the Board on February 1, 2019, his or her prorated RSUs will vest on May 1, 2019. If a director joins the Board on May 31, 2019, his or her prorated RSUs will vest on May 1, 2020. 
RSUs are recognized as an expense in the Company's financial statements for financial reporting purposes with respect to 2018 in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 718-10. 
Holders of these RSUs are entitled to participate in dividend equivalent payments and such payments may be settled in cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, to be decided by the Company in its sole discretion. Prior to the conversion to shares, RSU holders do not have any rights as an MSCI shareholder with respect to such RSUs, including the right to vote the underlying shares. The RSUs are generally non-transferable; however, our Board may, in its discretion, specify circumstances under which an award may become immediately transferable and nonforfeitable or under which the award will be forfeited. The RSUs vest and convert to shares immediately upon termination of service for reasons of death, disability or a change in control. If service as a director terminates for any other reason, all unvested RSUs will be cancelled and forfeited unless determined otherwise by the Board or the Compensation Committee. 
Non-employee directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with attending Board meetings. 
Director Deferral Plan 
On August 2, 2011, the Board adopted the MSCI Inc. Independent Directors Deferral Plan and subsequently amended and restated the plan in 2016 as the MSCI Inc. Non-Employee Directors Deferral Plan (the "Deferral Plan"). The Deferral Plan permits directors to defer receipt of shares of our common stock payable in lieu of cash retainers and/or upon conversion of RSUs granted to the director following the year for which an election has been submitted; provided that an election made by a director within 30 days after the director becomes eligible to receive a cash retainer or RSUs shall apply to any common stock payable in lieu of such a cash retainer and/or upon conversion of such RSUs granted to the director following the date on which the director makes the election. Receipt of shares of our common stock may be deferred until a future date specified by the director, a separation from service (as defined by Treasury regulations), or the earlier of the two. While the Deferral Plan allows for it, the Board has not yet implemented a process for the deferral of cash payments.

(1) Pursuant to MSCI's Third Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, directors hold office for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The Board term beginning on May 10, 2018 and ending on April 25, 2019 (the "2018 Board Term") and the Board term beginning on May 11, 2017 and ending on May 10, 2018 (the "2017 Board Term") do not coincide with MSCI's January through December fiscal year. Amounts included in the table above represent cash earned or paid, or stock awards granted, as applicable, during the year ended December 31, 2018. Because directors are paid for service from May 1 to April 30, prorated amounts are calculated from the applicable date to May 1st of the relevant Board term. 
(2) Cash amounts in this column include the annual retainers and Committee fees paid during the year ended December 31, 2018. Four of our directors elected to receive all or a portion of their annual cash retainers in stock as set forth below. The number of shares issued was determined by dividing the aggregate value of the elected portion of the cash retainer by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date ($150.66) and rounding down to the next whole share. Each of Mr. duPont and Mmes. Handy and Kinney elected to defer receipt of such shares until the 60th day after his or her "separation from service" as a director under the Deferral Plan.

(3) Represents the aggregate grant date fair value of RSUs granted in 2018 in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 718-10. The fair value is calculated by multiplying the closing price of our common stock on the date prior to the grant date by the number of units awarded. For assumptions regarding these calculations, please see notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2019. However, the values in this column may not correspond to the actual value that will be realized by the non-employee directors at the time the RSUs vest. The number of RSUs awarded is determined by dividing the aggregate value of the RSU award by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the trading day prior to the grant date ($149.83) and rounding down to the next whole RSU. For the 2018 Board term, each of Messrs.

Mr. duPont and Mmes. Handy and Kinney elected to defer receipt of such shares issuable upon vesting until the 60th day after their respective "separation from service" as a director under the Deferral Plan.

(5) Cash amounts in this column include dividend equivalents paid during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the Company's payment of its quarterly cash dividend. Each of Mr. duPont and Mmes. Handy and Kinney received shares of our common stock and a cash payment for fractional shares received as a dividend equivalent payment for outstanding RSUs and in lieu of receiving a cash dividend payment for shares subject to his/her deferral election.

(6) Ms. Lane is not standing for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting but will remain on the Board through that date. 
(7) Mr. Smith was appointed to the Audit Committee, effective January 30, 2018 and received a $2,493.15 pro-rated cash retainer for his service as a member of the Audit Committee for the 2017 Board Term.

(9) Mr. Vallee retired from the Board at our 2018 annual meeting of shareholders (May 10, 2018) and received a pro-rated cash retainer for his service on the Board for the 2018 Board Term, which included a cash amount in lieu of receiving a pro-rated RSU award. 
Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Under the Company's stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors, commencing on the date of our 2016 annual meeting of shareholders, each non-employee director has been required to own a target number of shares of stock of the Company equal to the sum of the "net shares" resulting from the vesting of the RSUs granted to such director for each of the last five years, with such aggregate share ownership to be achieved within five years of initially being elected or appointed to the Board and maintained thereafter. "Net shares" means the number of shares that would remain if the shares resulting from the vesting of the RSUs are sold to satisfy any tax obligations (assuming a tax rate of 40%) upon either (i) the conversion of such RSUs into shares or (ii) the cessation of any tax deferral period with respect to such RSUs. 
Shares that count towards satisfaction of the target level of stock ownership under these stock ownership guidelines consist of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Shares beneficially owned individually, either directly or indirectly (including any shares  beneficially owned as a result of an election to receive a retainer (or any portion thereof), in shares);

Handy, Kinney, Lane and Riefler each had 1,067 RSUs outstanding, and Mr. Ashe had 1,401 RSUs outstanding. Such RSUs are scheduled to vest on May 1, 2019.
(3) Except as indicated in the footnotes to this table, to our knowledge each executive officer and director, as of February 27, 2019, had sole voting and investment power with respect to his or her shares of our common stock. Beneficial Ownership Totals may differ from those set forth in Statements of Changes in Beneficial Ownership reported on Form 4 filed with the SEC due to the exclusion herein of RSUs granted by the Company, as described in footnote (1) to this table. 
(4) All executive officers and directors (other than Mr. Fernandez) each beneficially owned less than 1.0% of the shares of our outstanding common stock. Percentages for each beneficial owner are calculated in accordance with Rule 13d-3(d)(1) under the Exchange Act. Percentages for each named executive officer, executive officer and director as of February 27, 2019 and collectively as a group are based on the number of our shares outstanding as of February 27, 2019, which excludes shares of our common stock that can be acquired through vesting of RSUs and the exercise of stock options within 60 days of the date of this table (i.e., through April 28, 2019).

Wiechmann, who has been serving as the Company's Head of Strategy, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, to serve as Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, effective as of March 5, 2019. 
(7) Mr. Thakkar joined the Company in July 2018. 
(8) Ms. Lane is not standing for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting but will remain on the Board through that date.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (referred to as the "CD&A") section summarizes our general philosophy with regard to the compensation of our CEO, our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and our three next most highly paid executive officers in 2018 (collectively referred to as "named executive officers" or "NEOs"). The CD&A provides context for the executive compensation disclosures presented below in both tabular and narrative form. Under its charter, the Compensation Committee reviews the Company's compensation strategy and reviews and approves executive officer compensation as well as the Company's compensation and benefits policies generally. The Compensation Committee approved the compensation structure and amounts for each of our NEOs for 2018 and also approved changes to the long-term equity incentive component of our executive compensation program that became effective for equity grants in 2019. 
On March 1, 2019, Ms. Winters notified the Company of her decision to resign. The Board appointed Andrew C. Wiechmann, who has been serving as the Company's Head of Strategy, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, to serve as Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, effective as of March 5, 2019. 
Highlights 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY         
Our executive compensation program is designed to link pay to performance, encourage prudent decision-making and risk management, and create a balanced focus on short-term and long-term performance and value creation. In the dynamic and competitive environment in which we operate, it is imperative that we maintain a responsible executive compensation program that encourages and rewards our leaders for achieving short-term and long-term results.

The following table sets forth the key components of our target-based compensation program in effect in 2018 and 2019. The Compensation Committee approved certain enhancements to the 2019 long-term equity incentive program in response to shareholder feedback. These enhancements are described in greater detail beginning on page 51 of this Proxy Statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
ELEMENTS       Fixed Component: Base  salary   Variable Components:    Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)    Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP)

ELEMENTS       Fixed Component: Base  salary   Variable Components:    Annual Incentive Plan (AIP)    Long Term Incentive Program (LTIP) 
PHILOSOPHY       Each of the three  components has a different purpose. The sum of the base salary, target annual cash incentive and annualized target equity incentive creates a target total compensation. Actual cash incentive and equity incentive payouts are dependent upon the  achievement of the relevant AIP and LTIP goals tied directly to the performance of the Company, the product/functional unit and the individual. 
[END TABLE]
We believe that this target-based incentive structure fosters a culture of high performance and accountability and promotes long-term sustainable shareholder value creation by closely aligning executive compensation with objectively measured Company performance and strategic goal attainment as further described below. 
HOW PAY SUPPORTS OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY         
Our overriding objective is to create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. To accomplish this objective, we are focused on the following five strategic pillars: 
(i) expand leadership in research-enhanced content, (ii) strengthen existing and new client relationships by providing solutions, (iii) improve access to our solutions through cutting-edge technology and platforms, (iv) expand value-added service offerings and (v) execute strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies. 
The variable components of our compensation program (AIP and LTIP) are directly tied to the Company's strategy and performance.

KEY 2018 COMPENSATION DECISIONS         
We believe our executive compensation program encourages our NEOs to deliver strong financial results that position the Company for future growth and success. With the help of its external independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, the Compensation Committee carefully considered relevant internal and external economic and business factors affecting NEO pay for 2018. The Compensation Committee considered shareholder feedback, reviewed peer compensation analyses, kept apprised of the changing legal and regulatory framework affecting pay practices and reviewed the performance of our NEOs and the Company as a whole. 
As previously disclosed in our 2016, 2017 and 2018 proxy statements, we granted the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs to our NEOs in 2016, other than Mr. Thakkar, who joined the Company in July 2018, in order to further align our executive compensation program with our long-term strategic plan for fiscal years 2016 through 2018. The 2016 Multi-Year PSUs covered three years of the annual PSU component of long-term incentive compensation (i.e., for 2016, 2017 and 2018). As such, consistent with our previous commitment to our shareholders, (i) Mr. Fernandez was not granted equity awards in 2017 and 2018 and (ii) our other NEOs only received grants of RSUs (no PSUs) in 2017 and 2018. 
SEC disclosure rules require us to report the total three-year value of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs as 2016 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for 2016, rather than reporting the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs on an annualized basis for the years they cover (i.e., reporting one-third of the awards in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018). The table below illustrates an alternative way to view the compensation paid for 2018 to our NEOs who received 2016 Multi-Year PSUs (which reflects the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs (at their target value) on an annualized basis—i.e., one-third of the total three-year target value) relative to the total 2018 compensation that is required to be reported for such NEOs in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 pursuant to SEC rules. The table below is not a substitute for the tables and disclosure required by the SEC's rules, as set forth on page 74 of this Proxy Statement.

The table below illustrates an alternative way to view our CEO's year-over-year total compensation for each of 2018, 2017 and 2016, which similar to the table above, reflects the annualized target value (i.e., one-third of the target value) of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs for each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. As reflected in the table below, on an annualized basis, Mr. Fernandez's 2018 compensation (which is the subject of this year's Say-on-Pay Vote) increased by only 4.2% relative to 2017 and only 5.7% relative to 2016. Such increase was attributable to the increased payout of his annual cash bonus for 2018 based on actual performance against the applicable financial metrics and KPIs due to our strong financial performance and his performance in 2018 and an increase in his base salary. Mr. Fernandez had not received an increase in base salary since 2014 and did not receive an increase in his base salary for 2019.

[END TABLE]
As we committed to our shareholders and disclosed in 2018, no equity awards were granted to Mr. Fernandez in 2018, and our other NEOs were only granted RSUs (and no PSUs) in 2018. Since our 2018 Say-on-Pay vote, the Compensation Committee's actions with respect to Mr. Fernandez's compensation were solely to (i) pay him an annual cash bonus in respect of 2018 of $1.8 million under our AIP, based on actual performance against the applicable financial metrics and his KPIs and (ii) increase his LTIP target for 2019 by 10.1% (based on an annualized value of his LTIP target in 2018). The increase took into account the fact that Mr. Fernandez's LTIP awards will continue to be granted solely in the form of PSUs and the fact that his LTIP contained the greatest "at-risk" component as a result of receiving a higher percentage of 5-Year PSUs (as described below) than any other NEO.

KEY 2019 COMPENSATION DECISIONS         
During 2018, the Compensation Committee researched and evaluated an appropriate design for our 2019 LTIP since we were in the final performance year for the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs. After a thorough review and evaluation of the Company's and its peers' equity grant practices and taking into account shareholder feedback, the Compensation Committee implemented enhancements to the Company's long-term equity incentive program and continued to employ absolute TSR CAGR as the overarching measure of performance. The Company's 2019 equity compensation consists of grants of annual RSUs and PSUs with a mix based on position, as further detailed on page 66 of this Proxy Statement. Notably, the Company will not grant "multi-year" equity awards in 2019. The key features of the 2019 RSUs and PSUs are as follows: 
RSUs: "Granted to NEOs other than the CEO "Service-vest in three equal installments in each of 2020, 2021 and 2022 "The structure of this component remained unchanged from prior years)."Tied to long-term share price appreciation3-Year TSR PSUs: "Granted to all NEOs "Cliff-vest at the end of a three-year performance cycle from February 6, 2019 to February 5, 2022, based on achievement of rigorous absolute TSR CAGR performance metrics (see page [XX] below)"Realize meaningful value only to the extent that shareholders also realize value5-Year TSR PSUs: "Granted to all NEOs to facilitate an owner-operator mindset "Cliff-vest at the end of a five-year performance cycle from February 6, 2019 to February 5, 2024, based on achievement of rigorous absolute TSR CAGR performance metrics (see page [XX] below)"Provide stretch opportunity to reward for exceptional long-term value creation over a longer-than-typical performance period In response to shareholder feedback, the 3-Year PSUs and 5-Year PSUs granted in 2019:" do not include an alternative relative TSR performance metric; and "Are subject to only one performance period (i.e., there will be no re-test or extended performance period).

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND GOALS         
We evaluate our executive compensation structure on an annual basis to ensure alignment with our compensation philosophy and business strategy. Our compensation philosophy centers around maintaining a compensation program for our NEOs that is designed to promote the achievement of our short-term and long-term financial and strategic goals. The goals of the Company include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• driving long-term sustainable growth, profitability and shareholder value creation by protecting and  building our existing businesses;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• developing innovative and competitive products;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• pursuing organic and inorganic growth opportunities;

• strengthening our technology platform;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• focusing on client-centricity; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• developing our talent pipeline.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to those principles described in the "Executive Summary" on page 41 of this Proxy Statement, our executive compensation program is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• promote achievement of the Company's financial and strategic goals and provide alignment with  the strategic objectives of our multi-year strategic plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a framework to advance our strategic goals and encourage our NEOs to make a long-term  commitment to the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base compensation on the performance of the Company, the product/functional unit and the individual;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, retain and engage top-level talent and provide each  NEO with compensation opportunities that are competitive with market practices and within our cost structure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appropriately manage compensation risk in light of our business strategy; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align the long-term interests of our senior executives with those of our shareholders by promoting  actions that will allow for sustainable top- and bottom-line growth opportunities and capital returns to shareholders and maintain a culture of ownership and strong corporate governance practices.   
[END TABLE]
Our executive compensation philosophy provides a compensation structure which pays base salaries to our NEOs that represent a relatively small percentage of their total compensation, while offering them the opportunity to earn a significant portion of their compensation in the form of variable compensation (i.e., annual cash bonuses and long-term incentive awards). This emphasis on variable compensation is illustrated in our pay mix charts on the next page, which reflect 2018 compensation based on 2018 base salary, the actual annual cash incentives paid to our NEOs in respect of 2018 and the annualized target value of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs attributable to 2018 (i.e., one-third of the target value) for the CEO and the average of the other NEOs who received 2016 Multi-Year PSUs.

DETERMINATION OF EXECUTIVE  COMPENSATION—CONSIDERATIONS & PROCESS         
The Company does not have any individual employment, severance, or similar agreements with its NEOs, and therefore, our NEOs are employees "at will." As a result, the Company is not contractually bound to compensate the NEOs in a specific manner or amount and has the flexibility to alter or revise its compensation programs as circumstances dictate. The CEO makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee on compensation for NEOs other than himself, and the Compensation Committee takes these recommendations into consideration in reaching its compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee has sole authority to make final compensation decisions relating to the NEOs. 
The Compensation Committee selected and engaged Semler Brossy as its independent compensation consultant to assist with a range of executive compensation matters, including the overall design of our executive compensation program, evaluation and selection of peer group companies, provision of competitive market data and other matters related to our NEO compensation program. During 2018, Semler Brossy was present at all Compensation Committee meetings and consulted on executive compensation matters. The Compensation Committee recognizes that it is important to receive objective advice from its outside advisor. Therefore, Semler Brossy reports directly to the Compensation Committee, and the Compensation Committee, pursuant to its charter, maintains sole responsibility for retaining or terminating the compensation consultant. Semler Brossy did not provide any other services to MSCI during 2018. 
The Compensation Committee takes into account a range of factors in determining compensation components and setting compensation amounts. Among others, these factors include peer group analyses provided by Semler Brossy (used as a reference without benchmarking to a specified target), NEO performance against annual goals, various financial and operational metrics and KPIs. The weight attributed to each individual factor may change from time to time, depending on the circumstances of such decisions. We believe this continues to be the best approach for the Company, as it enables the Compensation Committee to balance competing interests, address evolving concerns and meet Company objectives.

2018 SAY-ON-PAY VOTE RESULTS AND SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT         
In 2018, 98.9% of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay Vote were voted in support of the compensation of our NEOs. 
While none of the shareholders we spoke with expressed any significant concerns regarding the Compensation Committee's compensation decisions in 2018, which are the subject of this year's Say-on-Pay Vote, the Compensation Committee carefully considers any feedback we do receive in order to determine whether any changes or enhancements to our executive compensation program will be made going forward. 
As discussed above, due to the grant of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs to our NEOs in 2016, as well as our adherence to our commitment that we would not grant our NEOs any PSUs in 2017 or 2018, the Compensation Committee was not in a position in 2017 or 2018 to incorporate feedback we received from our shareholders regarding the PSU component of our LTIP program until early 2019 (when the performance period applicable to the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs concluded). 
In connection with the design of our 2019 LTIP program, which will be the subject of the 2020 Say-on-Pay Vote, the Compensation Committee incorporated feedback we received from our shareholders, as described in the table below.

 Our shareholders indicated they prefer that a majority of our CEO's long-term incentive awards be  performance-based    100% PSUs in 2016 and in 2019 (no equity grants in 2017 or 2018)    We believe our CEO should be primarily rewarded for increasing absolute shareholder value which reinforces our "owner-operator" philosophy and is aligned with executing our strategic  plan 
[END TABLE]
The Company will continue to maintain an active dialogue with shareholders and evaluate feedback on issues of importance to them, including the metrics that drive each of our NEO's long-term incentive compensation.

Fixed Compensation 
Annual Base Salary 
Base salary is the only fixed component of our executive compensation program. The annual base salary element offers our NEOs a measure of certainty and predictability to meet ongoing living and other financial commitments. In setting base salaries for our NEOs, the Compensation Committee has sought to establish base salary rates that are competitive with those provided for similar positions at companies in our peer group that recognize the experience and performance of the NEO. The Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries of our NEOs on an annual basis. 
Effective January 1, 2019, Ms. Winters, our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, received an increase in base salary from $525,000 to $550,000. The increase was made as part of the Compensation Committee's annual review of the NEOs' base salaries and was intended to align her base salary with competitive market practice. No other changes to NEO base salaries were made.

[END TABLE]
Variable Compensation 
The variable compensation actually paid to our NEOs is subject to complementary performance metrics which are designed to emphasize pay for performance and balance short-term and long-term incentives and take into account input from our shareholders. The variable elements of our target-based incentive compensation program include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  an annual cash incentive component; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  a long-term equity incentive component  
[END TABLE]
In determining target cash and equity incentive compensation amounts for each NEO, the Compensation Committee takes into account a number of factors, including: the differences in relative responsibilities; the ability to impact overall Company performance; Company, product segment and individual performance; and historical compensation and peer group analyses (used as a reference without benchmarking to a specified target). 
There is no minimum amount of variable compensation payable to the NEOs. The Compensation Committee makes determinations, in its discretion, as to the amounts of variable compensation awarded based on program metrics and individual performance, subject to the terms of any applicable plan or arrangement.

[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Incentives 
The Company awards annual cash incentives pursuant to the Company's AIP, which closely aligns management's interests with those of shareholders by employing a formulaic approach that takes into account specific financial criteria and individual KPIs when determining cash incentives. The Compensation Committee believes that subjecting a portion of the cash incentive to pre-established performance targets further promotes shareholder value creation by more directly aligning executive compensation with Company performance and strategic goal attainment. Each NEO is eligible to earn an annual target cash incentive under the AIP. 
Under the AIP, participants may receive between 0% and 150% of their target cash incentive opportunity based on attainment of the level of financial performance metrics (weighted at 70%) and individual KPIs (weighted at 30%). For 2018, the target cash incentive opportunity, metrics, and corresponding weightings for our NEOs are included in the table set forth below:

(1) The actual cash incentive bonus paid to Mr. Thakkar in respect of fiscal 2018 was prorated from his start date of July 16, 2018. His annualized target cash incentive award is $700,000. 
For fiscal 2019, Mr. Pettit's target cash incentive opportunity under the AIP was increased to $1,201,919 to reflect competitive market practice for his role. 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation Program (LTIP) 
The Compensation Committee believes that MSCI's executive compensation program should reinforce a pay for performance culture that aligns the interests of our senior executives with those of our shareholders by incorporating the achievement of multi-year stock price performance metrics into variable compensation awards (in addition to the annual financial metrics applicable to cash incentive awards under the AIP). In 2018, we followed our typical practice of granting annual LTIP awards (i.e., granting RSUs to Messrs. Pettit and Seyer and Ms. Winters) following the regularly scheduled annual meeting of the Compensation Committee in January 2018. As was the case with Mr. Thakkar, we also periodically grant off-cycle LTIP awards (e.g., for new hire grants, replacement grants, retention grants, etc.). The grant date for such awards is determined on an individual basis, typically based on the applicable start date or the date of the event which triggered the award. 
RSUs 
RSUs are inherently aligned with the interest of our shareholders because they are linked to share price appreciation. They also increase the retentive value of our overall compensation program. Messrs. Pettit and Seyer and Ms. Winters, received service-vesting RSUs for their long-term incentive awards in 2018. These RSUs vest in equal annual installments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date. While these RSU awards do not have explicit performance-vesting conditions, the ultimate value that may be delivered to our NEOs from these awards depends on our future stock price performance. The table on the next page shows the value on the grant date of the RSU awards granted to our NEOs in 2018. 
Mr. Fernandez did not receive any RSUs in 2018 because 100% of his long-term incentive compensation is granted in the form of PSUs. Certain one-time RSU awards granted to Mr. Thakkar in connection with the commencement of his

2016 Multi-Year PSU Payout 
In light of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs that were granted in 2016 to the members of the Company's Executive Committee, including each of our current NEOs (other than Mr. Thakkar) none of our NEOs were granted PSU awards in 2018. The 2016 Multi-Year PSUs were granted to provide greater incentives for the execution of the Company's three-year strategic plan, the creation of additional long-term value-enhancing corporate development initiatives and closer alignment of our senior executives' interests with those of the Company's shareholders. 
The 2016 Multi-Year PSUs cliff-vested on February 8, 2019. The combined Multi-Year PSU payout percentage for the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs was 300% based on the achievement of an absolute TSR CAGR of 35.14%, well above the maximum performance level of 30% absolute TSR CAGR applicable to the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs. For information regarding the actual number of PSUs that Messrs. Fernandez, Pettit and Seyer and Ms. Winters received following the performance adjustment, please refer to page 78 of this Proxy Statement. 
When the Compensation Committee granted the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs, it established rigorous Absolute TSR performance metrics such that any above-target payout of the awards would need to be the result of significant value creation for our shareholders over the three-year performance period. As highlighted in the table below, the payout of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs at the maximum performance level was driven by our management team delivering market-leading returns for our shareholders, as illustrated by our cumulative total shareholder return and compound annual growth rate for the three-year performance period beginning on February 9, 2016 and ending on February 8, 2019, and an increase in our market capitalization of $7.9 billion.

Special 2015 PSU Award Payout

[END TABLE]
The payout percentage for the second tranche of this award based on the above level of ROIC achievement was 110% based on a target ROIC of 12.95% and achievement of 16.01%. The PSU payout percentage reflects adjustments to the target ROIC performance goals for the sale of the Real Estate occupiers business and the acquisition of the business of Insignis, Inc. For information regarding the actual number of PSUs that Mr. Pettit received following the performance adjustment, please refer to our 2018 proxy statement. 
2019 Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation Program 
In order to continue to promote the alignment of executive compensation and long-term shareholder value creation, and in response to shareholder feedback, the Compensation Committee adopted enhancements to the Company's long-term equity incentive compensation program for 2019. 
While the Compensation Committee made certain changes to equity incentive awards in 2019, the Compensation Committee's overall approach to equity incentive compensation in 2019 continues to place a strong emphasis on pay for performance by granting a significant portion of equity incentive awards in the form of PSUs that are subject to multi-year TSR-based performance metrics, which the Compensation Committee believes more closely align the Executive Committee's interests with those of the Company's shareholders and complement the annual financial metrics applicable to cash incentive awards under the AIP. 
Under its updated approach, on January 29, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of two types of 2019 PSU awards to the members of the Company's Executive Committee (including the NEOs)—3-Year PSUs and 5-Year PSUs (together, the "2019 PSUs"). 
The Compensation Committee introduced the 5-Year PSUs with a five-year performance period to further align our senior executives' pay opportunities with the long-term experience of our shareholders. The Compensation Committee believes that the longer performance time horizon will encourage senior executives to manage the business with an "owner-operator" mindset. 
The 2019 PSUs were granted on an annual basis—i.e., unlike the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs (which were intended to cover three-years of the PSU component of equity compensation), the 2019 PSU grants are intended to cover one year of the PSU component of equity compensation. The Compensation Committee believes that the grant of the annual PSUs to the Executive Committee members will provide greater incentives for the execution of the Company's strategic plan and the creation of additional value-enhancing corporate development initiatives. The Compensation Committee also granted service-vesting RSU awards to members of the Executive Committee (other than our CEO) on terms consistent with prior year RSU grants.

The 3-Year PSUs and 5-Year PSUs granted in 2019 will cliff-vest on February 5, 2022 and February 5, 2024, respectively, subject generally to the Executive's continued employment with the Company and the Company's level of achievement of the applicable absolute TSR CAGR performance metric measured over a three-year performance period and five-year performance period, respectively. 
In determining the target value of and appropriate mix for the 2019 PSUs, the Compensation Committee took into consideration the Executive's performance and potential future contributions, the Executive's overall career experience, peer group analyses, and the increased risk profile of the compensation program in relation to the Executive (i.e., the introduction of a longer-term performance measurement horizon). 
The table below sets forth the target value for each NEO's equity awards.

We generally received positive feedback from shareholders on the rigor of the TSR CAGR goals for the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs and thus carried forward the absolute TSR CAGR performance metric for the 2019 PSUs. Additionally, we added a long-term "stretch" vehicle that further encourages an "owner-operator" mindset and truly rewards exceptional shareholder value creation. The 5-Year PSUs carry the additional risk inherent in achieving longer-term, sustained performance and are discounted accordingly. 
The 3-Year PSUs and 5-Year PSUs reflect the right to receive between 0% and 300% and 0% and 200%, respectively, of the target number of shares based on achievement of the TSR CAGR performance metric over the applicable performance period.

We believe that a payout on the 3-Year PSUs and/or 5-Year PSUs at or above-target performance would benefit our shareholders due to significant increases in our share value over the applicable performance period, as illustrated by the table below. 
The 2019 PSUs contain current and post-employment restrictive covenants, including restrictions against competition, the solicitation of clients, vendors and employees of the Company and the use or disclosure of confidential information. 
The grant date fair value of the 2019 RSU and PSU awards will be included in our "Summary Compensation" Table and "Grants of Plan Based Awards" Table for 2019 in our 2020 proxy statement. SEC disclosure rules require that we report, in the year of grant, the total accounting value of equity grants on the grant date rather than over the life of the award. 
Former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Equity Awards 
As a result of Ms. Winters's resignation on March 1, 2019, all outstanding and unvested equity awards held by her as of such date were forfeited in their entirety pursuant to their terms. 
Benefits 
The Company provides health, welfare and other benefits to remain competitive in hiring and retaining its employees. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in these benefit plans on the same terms and conditions as all other employees. We do not provide any special or enhanced benefits to our NEOs.

In the United States and the United Kingdom, the Company has established defined contribution plans for all eligible employees. Contributions by the Company to these defined contribution plans for our NEOs for the applicable period are disclosed in the "All Other Compensation" column in the Summary Compensation Table below. 
Employment Agreements and Perquisites 
The NEOs are employed "at will." Based on the Company's philosophy that its executive compensation program should be straightforward and directly linked to performance, the compensation program for the NEOs does not include any of the following pay practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Employment agreements;

Information on post-termination and change in control payments to our NEOs as of December 31, 2018 is provided in the section titled "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control," on page 79 of this Proxy Statement. 
In connection with the commencement of his employment in 2018, Mr. Thakkar entered into an offer letter agreement with the Company. According to the terms of the offer letter, Mr. Thakkar's base salary was set at $500,000 per year and he became eligible to receive (i) an annual cash bonus award with a target opportunity of $700,000 and (ii) an annual long-term incentive award with a target opportunity of $1,300,000, granted with a mix of equity awards to be determined by the Compensation Committee in a manner consistent with our other NEOs for equity grants beginning in 2019. Mr. Thakkar's offer letter included a one-time $500,000 sign-on cash bonus and a one-time $1,350,000 sign-on cash bonus to compensate him for cash incentive awards and equity incentive awards, respectively, which were forfeited at his previous employer as a result of his resignation. Each of these one-time sign-on cash bonuses were paid to him on July 31, 2018 and require Mr. Thakkar to reimburse 100% of the cash bonus should he resign within 12 months of his hire date. He also received (i) a one-time sign-on RSU award with a grant date value of $1,760,000, which will vest in three equal installments on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, to compensate him for equity incentive awards that he forfeited at his previous employer as a result of his resignation and (ii) three special sign-on RSU awards with an aggregate value of $3,000,000. The first special RSU award was granted on July 16, 2018 and had a grant date fair value of $1,500,000. The second special RSU award will be granted on July 16, 2019 and will have a grant date fair value of $1,000,000. The third special RSU award will be granted on July 16, 2020 and will have a grant date fair value of $500,000. Each of the special RSU awards will vest in four equal installments on the first, second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. Mr. Thakkar also received $516,139.40 in the form of a relocation allowance, executive destination services and spousal job hunting assistance in connection with his relocation from Seattle to New York. Such amounts are disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES         
The Compensation Committee believes that significant stock ownership at the senior most levels of MSCI's leadership (e.g., the Executive Committee), which includes our executive officers, aligns management's interests with those of our shareholders and encourages an "owner-operator" mindset. As part of the Compensation Committee's ongoing assessment of the Company's compensation policies and practices to ensure furtherance of the goals identified above and for alignment with best practices, effective January 1, 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted the more rigorous stock ownership guidelines detailed below. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all Executive Committee members, including our NEOs, are in compliance with both the pre-2019 Stock Ownership Guidelines and the current Stock Ownership Guidelines. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   POSITION           STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES (EFFECTIVE 2019)    STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES (PRE-2019) 
   POSITION           STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES (EFFECTIVE 2019)    STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES (PRE-2019)

 President       4x base salary    3x base salary 
 Chief Operating Officer       4x base salary    3x base salary 
 Executive Officer       3x base salary    3x base salary 
 Executive Committee       3x base salary    2x base salary 
[END TABLE]
All Executive Committee members are required to meet the applicable ownership guidelines under the current Stock Ownership Guidelines within five years following the date of such executive's appointment to the Executive Committee (or, if later, five years from January 1, 2019). For the purpose of determining whether each individual is in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines and requirements, the following are counted towards satisfaction of the minimum ownership requirements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  shares beneficially owned individually, directly or indirectly;  
  (2)  shares beneficially owned jointly with, or separately by, immediate family members residing in the  same household, either directly or indirectly; and  
  (3)  "Net Shares" underlying unvested RSUs, unvested PSUs (solely to the extent of any award  minimum—i.e., any unvested PSUs that are subject to achievement of outstanding performance goals are not counted), "in-the money" vested stock options and any other vested or unvested equity  awards (as determined in the Compensation Committee's discretion).  
[END TABLE]
"Net Shares" means the number of shares that would remain if the shares underlying the equity awards are sold or withheld by the Company to (i) pay the exercise price of a stock option, (ii) satisfy any tax withholding obligations (assuming a tax rate of 50%) or (iii) satisfy any other applicable transaction costs. 
70• MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT 
[BEGIN TABLE]
             COMPENSATION MATTERS 
[END TABLE]
Until the expected ownership levels are achieved, each Executive Committee member is required to retain 50% of the Net Shares resulting from the vesting, settlement or exercise, as applicable of all stock options, RSUs, PSUs or other equity awards granted to such executive. 
In formulating the revised Stock Ownership Guidelines, the Compensation Committee reviewed competitive share ownership guideline data and considered changes that took into account the redesign of our LTIP and the appointments of Messrs. Pettit and Seyer to the positions of President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, in 2017. 
The Compensation Committee determined that increasing the share ownership multiples for the President and Chief Operating Officer better reflected alignment with the broader responsibilities of those roles and streamlining the ownership levels for all members of the Executive Committee (e.g., eliminating different treatment among executive officer and non-executive officer members of the Executive Committee) better reflected the equal contributions of Executive Committee members as the Company moves towards a more integrated approach to client service and product creation. 
Additionally, Executive Committee members who received 2016 Multi-Year PSUs are subject to share retention requirements for those awards, under which they are required to hold shares representing 50% of the net shares (after tax) received for a one-year period after vesting. 
The summary of the current Stock Ownership Guidelines provided herein is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Stock Ownership Guidelines, which was filed as an exhibit to the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Other Policies 
CLAWBACK POLICY         
Effective February 7, 2019, the Board expanded the Company's Clawback Policy beyond financial results or operating metrics that were achieved as a result of willful misconduct or intentional or fraudulent conduct. Under the revised Clawback Policy, the Board, acting upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, may to the extent permitted by applicable law, recoup any incentive compensation (cash and equity) received by members of the Executive Committee and the Company's Principal Accounting Officer, in the event of a restatement of financial or other performance-based measures (regardless of whether detrimental conduct has occurred) or in the event that detrimental conduct results in an increased level of performance goal achievement or otherwise causes material financial and/or reputational harm to the Company, as described below. 
In the case of a restatement of financial or other performance-based measures, the Board may recover up to the amount by which the incentive compensation received exceeds the amount that would have been received if the error had not been made within the two years preceding the date on which the Board determines that the financial or other measure contains a material error. 
In the case of detrimental conduct, that in the sole discretion of the Board, has resulted in a level of achievement of a performance-based measure or caused material financial or reputational harm to the Company, the Board may recover incentive compensation received by the person during the two-year period immediately preceding the date on which such person engaged in such detrimental conduct (or the date on which the Compensation Committee discovers that such person engaged in detrimental conduct). Detrimental conduct consists of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• willful misconduct or breach of a fiduciary duty with respect to the Company or any of its  subsidiaries;  
[END TABLE]
MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT• 71 
[BEGIN TABLE]
COMPENSATION MATTERS

• conviction of, or having entered a plea bargain or settlement admitting guilt for, any crime of moral  turpitude or felony under any applicable law with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries;

• commission of an act of fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation, with respect to the Company or any  of its subsidiaries;

• failure to take action with respect to any acts or conduct described above when taken by another  person that such person has actual knowledge of or directing any other person to take any of the actions described above; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• breach of any restrictive covenant to which such person is subject contained in any applicable  agreement or arrangement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.  
[END TABLE]
The expanded Clawback Policy applies to all incentive compensation (cash and equity) granted on or after February 7, 2019. Incentive compensation granted prior to that date remains subject to the prior Clawback Policy which is described in greater detail in our 2018 proxy statement. 
When the final clawback requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") are released, we will review our policy and modify it if necessary to ensure compliance. The summary of the Clawback Policy provided herein is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Clawback Policy, which was filed as an exhibit to the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
ANTI-HEDGING AND PLEDGING POLICY         
We prohibit all directors and employees, including all NEOs, from hedging or pledging the Company's common stock or engaging in short sales, purchases or sales of options, puts or calls, as well as derivatives such as swaps, forwards or futures and trading on a short-term basis in the Company's common stock. 
TAX CONSIDERATIONS         
The Compensation Committee takes into consideration the tax implications of our executive compensation program, including with respect to the tax deductibility of compensation paid under Section 162(m) of the IRC. 
Section 162(m) of the IRC generally limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid in excess of $1 million to certain of our executive officers during any taxable year. Prior to the enactment of Tax Reform, Section 162(m) of the IRC provided an exception from this deduction limitation for "qualified performance-based compensation," which we historically relied on by awarding cash and equity incentive compensation to our executive officers under the MSCI Inc. Performance Formula and Incentive Plan and/or the 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Pursuant to Tax Reform, effective January 1, 2018 for MSCI, the "performance-based compensation" exception under Section 162(m) of the IRC was eliminated. However, there is transition relief for compensation paid pursuant to a "written binding contract" in effect on or before November 2, 2017 and not materially modified thereafter. 
In the exercise of its business judgment, and in accordance with its compensation philosophy, the Compensation Committee continues to have flexibility to award compensation that is not tax deductible if it determines that such award is in our shareholders' best interests and is necessary to comply with contractual commitments, or to maintain flexibility needed to attract talent, promote retention or recognize and reward desired performance.

COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT         
The Compensation Committee believes that the design, implementation and governance of our executive compensation program are consistent with high standards of risk management. Our executive compensation program reflects an appropriate mix of compensation elements, balancing current and long-term performance objectives, cash and equity compensation, and risks and rewards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation framework used for making compensation decisions is multi-faceted as it incorporates  multiple metrics over varying time periods and is subject to the application of informed judgment by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To further ensure that the interests of our NEOs are aligned with those of our shareholders, a  significant portion of executive officer long-term incentive compensation is awarded as equity subject to vesting requirements. RSUs and PSUs typically vest and settle over a three-year or five-year period, as applicable—in the case of RSUs,  ratably over three years, and in the case of PSUs, cliff-vesting based on achievement of applicable performance goals at the end of a three-year or five-year performance period, as applicable).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive Committee members are required to meet the applicable stock ownership guidelines described  under "Stock Ownership Guidelines" on page 70 of this Proxy Statement, including, for individuals who received 2016 Multi-Year PSUs, a requirement to hold shares representing 50% of the net shares (after tax) received for a one-year period after vesting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive compensation is subject to the Clawback Policy described under "Clawback Policy"  on page 71 of this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
Based on these features, we believe our executive compensation program effectively (i) ensures that our compensation opportunities do not encourage excessive risk taking, (ii) keeps our NEOs focused on the creation of long-term, sustainable value for our shareholders and (iii) provides competitive and appropriate levels of compensation over time. 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed our compensation policies as generally applicable to all of our employees and believes that our policies do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking and that any level of risk they do encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Semler Brossy assisted the Compensation Committee with its review of our compensation program by reviewing materials provided by management related to our compensation program, including the Company's LTIP. The Compensation Committee also reviewed materials prepared by a third-party consultant in 2017 related to certain of the Company's variable incentive plans, including the AIP, from a risk and governance perspective. 
Compensation & Talent Management Committee Report         
We, the Compensation & Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors of MSCI Inc., have reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above. Based on this review and these discussions, the Compensation & Talent Management Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(9) The amount reflected for Mr. Thakkar in the "All Other Compensation" column includes a one-time relocation allowance of $516,139.40 provided to him in connection with the commencement of his employment with the Company in 2018. This amount also includes (a) $500,000 to cover all relocation, living and commuting expenses for relocation from Seattle to New York, (b) an amount to cover executive destination services which provide neighborhood tours, home search, school search, etc. and spousal job hunting assistance, which includes a reimbursement for taxes in the amount of $7,550. 
(10) The 2016 Multi-Year PSUs covered three years of PSU grants. Accordingly, our NEOs did not receive PSUs (and no RSUs, in the case of Mr. Fernandez) in 2017 and 2018. However, due to SEC disclosure rules, we were required to report the entire three-year value of these awards in the "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2016. Because the "Stock Awards" column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2017 and 2018 only includes the value of the annual RSU awards granted for 2017 and 2018, the variances between the amounts reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2016, 2017 and 2018 are presented in a manner that is not consistent with how the Compensation Committee viewed the awards–i.e., that the annualized target value (i.e., one-third of the target value) of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs should be reflected in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 as compensation for 2018 (with the other two-thirds reflected equally in the Summary Compensation Tables for 2016 and 2017). Accordingly, notwithstanding the SEC's disclosure rules, we believe the 2018 total direct compensation for our NEOs who received the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs (taking into account the annualized target value of their 2016 Multi-Year PSUs relating to 2018) to be as follows: $8,700,080 for Mr. Fernandez, $2,829,620 for Ms. Winters, $4,282,592 for Mr. Pettit and $3,076,891 for Mr. Seyer. The amounts in the previous sentence do not include the amounts set forth in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table for 2018.

The RSUs (other than Mr. Thakkar's one-time RSU awards which are described below) vest in three annual installments of 34%, 33% and 33% beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. In connection with the commencement of his employment with the Company, Mr. Thakkar received: (i) a one-time sign-on RSU award to compensate him for equity incentive awards that he forfeited at his previous employer as a result of his resignation and (ii) the first of three grants of special sign-on RSU awards. The special RSU award vests in four annual installments of 25% each beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. For additional details on these RSU awards, see page 69 of this Proxy Statement. The amounts included for Mr. Thakkar in this column include these RSU awards. 
(3) Represents the grant date fair value of stock awards as computed in accordance with FASB ASC Subtopic 718-10.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL         
Change in Control Severance Plan 
In the event of a change in control of the Company, Executive Committee members, including all of our NEOs, would be entitled to benefits under the MSCI Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan (the "CIC Plan"), which was adopted by the Board of Directors in May 2015. The CIC Plan covers participants identified on a schedule attached to the CIC Plan (subject to any additions to or removals from the participant list by the Compensation Committee), including the Company's CEO, CFO and the Company's other NEOs. In the event of a "Qualifying Termination" (as defined in the CIC Plan), participants will receive the severance payments and benefits specified in the CIC Plan. Severance payments and benefits under the CIC Plan are subject to a "double-trigger" as both a change in control and a termination of the participant's employment by the Company without "cause" or by the participant for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the CIC Plan) are required in order for the participant to qualify for payments and benefits. The CIC Plan does not include any golden parachute excise tax gross-up provisions. Any severance payments and benefits under the CIC Plan are subject to execution of an agreement by the CIC Plan participant releasing claims against the Company. Participants are also obligated to comply with confidentiality, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants under their release agreement. 
Annual Incentive Plan 
In the event of a change in control (as defined in the AIP), unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, the performance period applicable to any outstanding AIP cash bonus award will cease as of the date immediately prior to the change in control. The portion of any such award based on performance metrics (other than KPIs) will be payable based on the higher of (i) the Company's actual achievement of the performance metrics (other than KPIs) for the prorated period ending immediately prior to the change in control and (ii) 100%. The portion of any such award based on KPIs will be payable at 100% of the target KPIs. All awards will be payable by the Company (or the successor or survivor entity) within 60 days of the date of the change in control, prorated for the portion of the applicable performance period 
MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT• 79 
[BEGIN TABLE]
COMPENSATION MATTERS              
[END TABLE]
 that elapsed prior to the change in control. If the Company's successor will not be implementing a comparable annual incentive plan for the remaining portion of the year in which the change in control occurs, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, elect not to prorate the awards. If any AIP participant is eligible to receive a prorated annual bonus for the year in which the change in control occurs pursuant to any other change in control severance plan, including the CIC Plan, the individual's prorated annual bonus payable under such other plan will be reduced by the amount of the bonus paid under the AIP. 
Equity Acceleration 
The descriptions of equity acceleration provisions below apply to the applicable outstanding equity awards as of December 31, 2018. 
Terminations Other than due to Death, Disability, Involuntary Termination without Cause, Governmental Service or Full Career Retirement. Upon termination of an NEO's employment for any reason other than due to death, disability, involuntary termination without cause, certain governmental service or full career retirement (as such terms are defined in the applicable award agreement), his or her unvested RSUs and PSUs will generally be cancelled immediately. Equity awards granted to NEOs who are eligible for full career retirement are cancelled following a termination for cause. 
Death or Disability. Upon termination of an NEO's employment due to death or "disability" (as defined in the applicable award agreement):

(1) All values are based on a closing stock price of $147.43 per share as of December 31, 2018. The amounts included in this table also represent values associated with the acceleration of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs. However, such PSUs vested on February 8, 2019 and the ultimate payouts were certified by the Compensation Committee on February 13, 2019. As such, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, the value attributable to the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs reflected in the table above are no longer currently applicable in the event of any future termination of employment or change in control. 
(2) These amounts represent the values associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and payout of PSUs at the target performance level upon a termination of the NEO's employment due to an involuntary termination without cause (not following a change in control), in each case, pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement. The value associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and PSUs (assuming payout at the maximum performance level) is $57,047,449 for Mr. Fernandez, $11,417,716 for Ms. Winters, $17,452,321 for Mr. Pettit, $19,802,355 for Mr. Seyer and $2,834,047 for Mr. Thakkar. As indicated above, these values are largely attributable to the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs and are no longer applicable as of the date of this Proxy Statement, as the awards have since vested and been paid out to the NEOs. 
(3) These amounts represent the values associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and payout of PSUs at the target performance level upon a termination of the NEO's employment due to death or disability, in each case, pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement. The value associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and PSUs (assuming payout at the maximum performance level) is $82,998,372 for Mr. Fernandez, $15,595,145 for Ms. Winters, $24,543,114 for Mr. Pettit, $26,838,747 for Mr. Seyer, and $2,834,047 for Mr. Thakkar. 
(4) These amounts represent the values associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and payout of PSUs at the target performance level upon a termination of the NEO's employment due to a termination for government service pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement. The value associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and PSUs (assuming payout at the maximum performance level) is $85,571,615 for Mr. Fernandez, $16,013,109 for Ms. Winters, $25,187,973 for Mr. Pettit, $27,489,356 for Mr. Seyer and $2,834,047 for Mr. Thakkar. 
(5) A lump sum cash payment under our CIC Plan equal to the sum of (1) two times the participant's base salary and (2) two times the participant's average annual cash bonus (three-year average annual cash bonus). For more information on our CIC Plan and qualifying terminations of employment thereunder, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control—Change in Control Severance Plan" above. Since Mr. Thakkar commenced his employment with the Company in July 2018, the amount included for him reflects the annualized target cash bonus amount provided in his offer letter described on page 69 of this Proxy Statement.

(6) A lump sum cash payment under our CIC Plan equal to 135% of the approximate amount of COBRA continuation premiums for the participant and his or her eligible dependents for 24 months for the coverage option and level of medical, dental and/or vision coverage in effect for the participant immediately prior to the date of termination (or, in the case of an international participant, equivalent local private medical benefits); provided, however, that such continued participation shall only be provided to an international participant to the extent permitted under the terms of any applicable group health plan and applicable law. For more information on our CIC Plan and qualifying terminations of employment thereunder, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control—Change in Control Severance Plan" above. 
(7) These amounts represent the values associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and payout of PSUs at the target performance level upon a termination of the NEO's employment by the Company without cause or by the NEO for good reason, in each case, within 24 months following a change in control, pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreement. The value associated with the acceleration of unvested RSUs and PSUs (assuming payout at the maximum performance level) is $85,571,615 for Mr. Fernandez, $16,013,109 for Ms. Winters, $25,187,973 for Mr. Pettit, $27,489,356 for Mr. Seyer, and $2,834,047 for Mr. Thakkar. 
(8) For Messrs. Fernandez and Pettit, excludes unvested but outstanding RSU and PSUs at target, due to the awards' Full Career Retirement provisions. As of December 31, 2018, the values of these awards at target were $14,261,936 and $5,134,987 for Messrs. Fernandez and Pettit, respectively. These awards would be cancelled following an involuntary termination for cause (as defined in the award agreement), but would not be cancelled upon a voluntary termination. 
2018 PAY RATIO         
In accordance with the requirements of Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K (which we collectively refer to as the "Pay Ratio Rule"), we are providing the following estimated information for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees (except our Chief Executive Officer)  was $55,857;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer was $2,978,454; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ratio of these two amounts was 53 to 1. We believe that this ratio is a reasonable estimate  calculated in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Pay Ratio Rule.  
[END TABLE]
Due to SEC disclosure rules, we were required to report the total three-year value of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs granted to our CEO as 2016 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for 2016, rather than reporting the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs on an annualized basis for the years it covers (i.e., reporting one-third of the award value in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018). Accordingly, an alternative way to view our CEO Pay Ratio for 2018 is to include the annualized target value of the CEO's Multi-Year PSUs that is attributable to 2018 (i.e., one-third of the target value of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs) as part of his 2018 annual total compensation, which would result in a CEO Pay Ratio for 2018 of 159 to 1. 
SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and apply various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies. 
Methodology for Identifying Our "Median Employee" 
Employee Population 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (other than our Chief Executive Officer), we first identified our total employee population from which we determined our "median employee." We determined that, as of October 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of 3,122 individuals (of which 23.1% were located in the United States and 76.9% were located in jurisdictions outside the United States). As of December 31, 2018, 61.4% and 38.6% of our employees were located in emerging market centers and developed market centers, respectively. Our employee population consisted of our global workforce of full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees, as described in more detail below.

[BEGIN TABLE]
COMPENSATION MATTERS              
[END TABLE]
Determining our Median Employee 
To identify our "median employee" from our total employee population, we compared the amount of base salary plus actual cash bonus paid for 2018. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of our full-time employees who were hired in 2018 but did not work for us for the entire fiscal year and permanent part-time employees. We identified our "median employee" using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all of our employees included in the calculation. 
Our Median Employee 
Using the methodologies described above, we determined that our "median employee" was a full-time, salaried employee located in Mumbai, India, with base wages for the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018 in the amount of $41,229. 
Determination of Annual Total Compensation of our "Median Employee" and our CEO 
Once we identified our "median employee," we then calculated such employee's annual total compensation for 2018 using the same methodology we used for purposes of determining the annual total compensation of our NEOs for 2018 (as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 on page 74 of this Proxy Statement).

Proposal No. 2 - Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay) 
The Dodd-Frank Act enables MSCI's shareholders to vote to approve, on an advisory or non-binding basis, the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules. 
For an overview of the compensation of our NEOs, see "Compensation Matters—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Executive Summary" above. 
We are asking for shareholder approval of the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with SEC rules, which include the disclosures under "Compensation Matters—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" above, the compensation tables included therein and the narrative following the compensation tables. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. 
This vote is advisory and therefore not binding on MSCI, the Compensation Committee or the Board. The Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of MSCI's shareholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider those shareholders' concerns, and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. MSCI currently conducts annual advisory votes on executive compensation. 
VOTE REQUIRED AND RECOMMENDATION         
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at our 2019 Annual Meeting, at which a quorum is present, is required to approve Proposal No. 2. Abstentions shall not be treated as votes cast.

Pre-Approval Policy of the Audit Committee of Services Performed by Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee has implemented pre-approval policies and procedures related to the provision of audit and non-audit services by the independent auditor to ensure the services do not impair their independence. Under these procedures, the Audit Committee pre-approves both the type of services to be provided by the independent auditors and the estimated fees related to those services. During the pre-approval process, the Audit Committee considers the impact of the types of services and the related fees on the independence of the auditor. Even if a service has received general pre-approval, if it involves a fee in excess of $400,000 or relates to tax planning and advice, it requires a separate pre-approval of the full Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee to pre-approve certain engagements not requiring approval by the full Audit Committee. The Chair must report, for informational purposes, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The services and fees must be deemed compatible with the maintenance of the auditor's independence, including compliance with SEC and NYSE rules and regulations. Management reports the actual fees versus pre-approved amounts periodically throughout the year by category of service. 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which is accessible through the "Corporate Governance" link found on our website's Investor Relations homepage (http://ir.msci.com). Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement or any other report we file with the SEC. The Audit Committee is responsible for the oversight of the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting, the Company's risk management, the qualifications and independence of the Company's independent auditor, the performance of the Company's internal and independent auditors and the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee has the sole authority and responsibility to appoint, compensate, evaluate and, when appropriate, replace the Company's independent auditor. The Board has determined that all of the Audit Committee's members are independent under the applicable independence standards of the NYSE and the Exchange Act. 
The Audit Committee serves in an oversight capacity and is not part of the Company's managerial or operational decision-making process. Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and for the report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company's independent auditor for the year ended December 31, 2018, PwC, was responsible for auditing the consolidated financial statements included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, expressing an opinion as to their conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, as well as reviewing the Company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to oversee the financial reporting process and to review and discuss management's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to us and on the representations made by management, the internal auditor and the independent auditor.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee discussed with PwC matters that independent registered public accounting firms are required to discuss with audit committees in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including, among other things, matters related to the conduct of the audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16 "Communications with Audit Committees." This review included discussions by the Audit Committee with management regarding the Company's consolidated financial statements and with the independent auditor as to the audit thereof, including, among other things, the quality (not merely the acceptability) of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in the Company's consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies. 
PwC also provided to the Audit Committee its annual independence letter required under Rule 3526 of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and represented that it is independent from the Company. We discussed with PwC their independence from the Company, and considered whether the services they provided to the Company beyond those rendered in connection with their integrated audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, and the reviews of the Company's interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, were compatible with maintaining their independence.

             AUDIT MATTERS 
[END TABLE]
Based on our review and these meetings, discussions and reports described above, and subject to the limitations on our role and responsibilities referred to above and in the Audit Committee's charter, we recommended to the Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Proposal No. 3 - Ratification of the Appointment of MSCI Inc.'s Independent Auditor 
The Audit Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as independent auditors for 2019 and presents this selection to the shareholders for ratification. PwC will audit our consolidated financial statements for 2019 and perform other permissible pre-approved services. 
A PwC representative will attend the 2019 Annual Meeting to respond to your questions and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so. If shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider it. Even if shareholders ratify the selection of PwC, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a new independent auditor at any time during the year if it believes that the change would be in the best interest of the Company. 
The Audit Committee periodically reviews the engagement of the independent auditor to assess, among other things, the skills, experience, service levels and costs associated with conducting the annual audit of the Company's financial statements. 
VOTE REQUIRED AND RECOMMENDATION         
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at our 2019 Annual Meeting, at which a quorum is present, is required to approve Proposal No. 3. Abstentions shall not be treated as votes cast.

Related Person Transactions Policy 
The Company maintains a written Related Person Transactions Policy (the "Policy"), which governs the approval of related person transactions. The Governance Committee administers the Policy and may amend it from time to time. For purposes of the Policy: (i) a Related Person Transaction means (1) a Transaction involving the Company in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 in any fiscal year and a Related Person has a direct or indirect material interest and (2) any material amendment or modification to the foregoing, regardless of whether such Transaction previously has been approved in accordance with the Policy; (ii) a "Related Person" means any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year was, a director or executive officer of MSCI or a nominee to become a director of MSCI, a person or entity that is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of MSCI's voting securities, excluding any beneficial owner that reports its ownership on Schedule 13G pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b) under the Exchange Act (a "5% Stockholder" under the Policy) and the Immediate Family Members (as defined in the Policy) of any of the foregoing; provided, however, that the General Counsel may nevertheless determine that it would be advisable for specific transactions by beneficial owners reporting on Schedule 13G pursuant to Rule 13d-1(b) to be reviewed under the Policy; and (iii) a "Transaction" means any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, including indebtedness, guarantees of indebtedness and transactions involving employment and similar relationships. Under the Policy, the Legal and Compliance Department, in consultation with the General Counsel and outside counsel to the extent appropriate, determines whether potential Related Person Transactions are subject to review under the Policy and/or disclosure as a Related Person Transaction under SEC rules; provided that any potential Related Person Transaction with the General Counsel will be reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and referred to the Governance Committee, if appropriate. If the Legal and Compliance Department and the 
90• MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT 
[BEGIN TABLE]
             OTHER MATTERS 
[END TABLE]
 General Counsel determine that (i) the proposed Transaction constitutes a Related Person Transaction or (ii) it would be beneficial to further review the Transaction under the Policy, then, in either case, the Transaction is referred to the Governance Committee for approval or ratification. 
Directors, director nominees and executive officers are required to report for themselves and their Immediate Family Members (as defined in the Policy) (i) relationships that are outside the ordinary course of business; (ii) employment of Immediate Family Members; (iii) transactions that would be considered unusual for one or both of the parties; (iv) transactions that are provided on terms that may be more favorable than those available to the general public; (v) transactions where they receive compensation or other material benefits of any kind from the other entity, in whole or part, due to the creation, negotiation or approval of the transaction; (vi) transactions where they are personally involved in the creation, negotiation or approval of the transaction (other than as an employee of MSCI); and (vii) transactions where they are a more than 10% equity holder of the other entity. 
In determining whether to approve a Related Person Transaction, the Governance Committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances, including (if applicable) without limitation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  the commercial reasonableness of the terms of the proposed Transaction;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  the benefit to the Company and the availability and/or opportunity costs of alternative  Transactions;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  the materiality and character of the Related Person's direct or indirect interest;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  the nature of the negotiations (e.g., whether the proposed Transaction was the result of arm's  length negotiations and fair dealing); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  whether the Transaction would, or would be perceived to, present an improper conflict of interest  for the Related Person taking into account (i) the size of the Transaction; (ii) the overall financial position of the Related Person; (iii) the direct or indirect nature of the Related Person's interest in the Transaction;  (iv) whether the Transaction is of an ongoing nature; and (v) any other relevant factors; and if the Related Person is a director (or an Immediate Family Member of a director), the impact on the director's independence under  applicable rules. Certain categories of Transactions set forth in the Policy have been determined not to be Related Person Transactions and are not subject to the Policy.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to Related Person Transactions with directors or officers or with entities in which such person may serve as an officer, director, trustee or similar role pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Governance Committee may consider (1) whether such director or officer received any compensation or material benefit of any kind from the other entity due, in whole or in part, to the creation, negotiation or approval of the Transaction and (2) whether such director or officer is personally involved in the creation, negotiation or approval of the Transaction. 
Except as the Legal and Compliance Department shall otherwise determine based on the information provided pursuant to the Policy, the following Transactions have been determined not to be Related Person Transactions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  transactions between MSCI and any entity in which a Related Person has a relationship solely as a  director, a less than 5% equity holder of any entity whose equity securities are publicly traded, a less than 10% holder of an entity whose equity securities are not publicly traded, an employee (other than an executive officer) or one or more of  these relationships;

ANNEX A              
[END TABLE]
WHO MAY VOTE AT THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING? 
You can vote your shares of MSCI common stock at our 2019 Annual Meeting if you were a shareholder at the close of business on February 27, 2019 (the "record date"). As of February 27, 2019, there were 84,665,447 shares of MSCI common stock outstanding. Each share of MSCI common stock entitles you to one vote on each matter voted on at the annual meeting of shareholders. 
A majority of the shares of MSCI common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date must be present in order to hold the meeting and conduct business. This is called a "quorum." Your shares are counted as present at the 2019 Annual Meeting if you vote through the internet at the virtual annual meeting of shareholders or properly submit your proxy prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
WHY DID I RECEIVE A ONE-PAGE NOTICE IN THE MAIL REGARDING THE INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS INSTEAD OF A FULL SET OF PRINTED PROXY MATERIALS? 
Pursuant to the "notice and access" rules adopted by the SEC, we are making this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (including any amendments thereto) available to our shareholders over the internet. As a result, unless you have previously requested electronic access to our proxy materials or the receipt of paper proxy materials, you will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K (including any amendments thereto) over the internet, how to request a paper or email copy of these materials and how to vote by mail, telephone or via the internet. We will mail the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials on or about March 11, 2019. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. 
In addition, if you are voting online, you will be prompted to consent to receiving proxy materials electronically in future years. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials electronically will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our annual meetings of shareholders on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials electronically, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials electronically will remain in effect until you terminate it. See "How do I sign up for electronic delivery of proxy materials?" below for further information on electing to receive proxy materials electronically. 
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOLDING SHARES AS A "RECORD HOLDER" AND AS A BENEFICIAL OWNER OF SHARES HELD IN "STREET NAME"? 
Record Holder. If your shares are registered directly in your name with MSCI's transfer agent, Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc. (including its affiliates, "Broadridge"), you are considered a "record holder" with respect to those shares, and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will be sent directly to you. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account with a brokerage firm, bank, broker dealer, or other intermediary, then you are considered a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and other proxy materials will be forwarded to you by that intermediary. As a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," you have the right to direct that intermediary on how to vote the shares held in your account by following their instructions for voting. If you do not provide your brokerage firm, bank, broker dealer or other intermediary with instructions on how to vote your shares, such intermediary or intermediary nominee will be able to vote your shares only with respect to the proposal related to the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditor for 2019.

As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we did not know of any proposals or matters to be raised at the 2019 Annual Meeting other than those presented in this Proxy Statement. 
MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT• A-3 
[BEGIN TABLE]
ANNEX A              
[END TABLE]
Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in "Street Name." Broker non-voting occurs when your brokerage firm, bank, broker dealer or other intermediary has not received specific voting instructions from you with respect to shares held in "street name" and the broker does not have discretionary voting authority with respect to a proposal. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and you do not give instructions as to how to vote, your broker may have authority to vote your shares only on discretionary items but not on non-discretionary items, as determined by the NYSE. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-discretionary items. The following  proposals are considered "non-discretionary" items: Proposal No. 1—election of directors and Proposal No. 2—approve, by non-binding vote,  our executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discretionary item. Proposal No. 3—the ratification of the appointment of  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent auditor for 2019 is a "discretionary" item. NYSE member brokers that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners of shares held in "street name" may vote  on this proposal in their discretion, subject to any voting policies adopted by the broker holding your shares.  
[END TABLE]
Broker non-votes are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. However, broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of Proposal Nos. 1 and 2 and will therefore have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Therefore, if you hold your shares in an account with a brokerage firm, bank, a broker dealer or other intermediary, it is critically important that you submit your voting instructions if you want your shares to count for the non-discretionary items listed above. 
WHAT ARE MY CHOICES FOR CASTING MY VOTE ON EACH MATTER TO BE VOTED ON? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSAL NO.    PROPOSAL    VOTING OPTIONS    EFFECT OF ABSTENTIONS 
 1    Election of Directors    FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN (for each director nominee)    No effect—not counted as a "vote cast" 
 2     Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay)    FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN    No effect—not counted as a "vote cast" 
 2     Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay)    FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN    No effect—not counted as a "vote cast" 
 3     Ratification of the Appointment of MSCI's Independent Auditor    FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN    No effect—not counted as a "vote cast" 
 3     Ratification of the Appointment of MSCI's Independent Auditor    FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN    No effect—not counted as a "vote cast" 
[END TABLE]
Under the laws of Delaware (our state of incorporation), if the director is not elected at the annual meeting, the director will continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover director." Our Bylaws also provide that, in order for an incumbent director to become a nominee of the Board, the director must submit an irrevocable resignation as director that becomes effective if (i) he or she does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election and (ii) the Board accepts the resignation. If a director does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election, the Governance Committee will consider the director's resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board will decide whether to accept or reject the resignation and publicly disclose its decision, including the rationale behind the decision if it rejects the resignation, within 90 days after the election results are certified.

"Adjusted EBITDA," a measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments. 
"Adjusted EBITDA expenses," a measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments. 
"Adjusted net income" and "adjusted EPS" are defined as net income and diluted EPS, respectively, before the after-tax impact of the amortization of acquired intangible assets, the impact of divestitures, the impact of Tax Reform adjustments (except for amounts associated with active tax planning implemented as a result of Tax Reform) and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments. 
"Adjusted tax rate" is defined as the effective tax rate excluding the impact of Tax Reform adjustments (except for amounts associated with active tax planning implemented as a result of Tax Reform). 
"Capex" is defined as capital expenditures plus capitalized software development costs.

"Free cash flow" is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, less Capex. 
"Operating revenues ex-FX and ex-divestitures" is defined as operating revenues excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange and the operating revenues attributable to divested businesses for the comparable prior year period. 
We believe adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA expenses are meaningful measures of the operating performance of MSCI because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be our core operating performance in the period. 
We believe adjusted net income and adjusted EPS are meaningful measures of the performance of MSCI because they adjust for the after-tax impact of significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be our core performance in the period. 
We believe that adjusted tax rate is useful to investors because it increases the comparability of period-to-period results by adjusting for the estimated net impact of Tax Reform. 
We believe that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of MSCI to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations, such as investment in MSCI's existing products. Further, free cash flow indicates our ability to strengthen MSCI's balance sheet, repay our debt obligations, pay cash dividends and repurchase shares of our common stock. 
We believe operating revenues ex-FX and ex-divestitures are meaningful measures of the operating performance of MSCI because they adjust for the impact of foreign currency exchange and exclude the impact of operating revenues attributable to divested businesses for the comparable prior year period, providing insight to our core operating performance for the period(s) presented. 
Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA expenses, adjusted net income, adjusted EPS, adjusted tax rate, Capex, free cash flow and operating revenues ex-FX and ex-divestitures, are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to similarly-titled non-GAAP financial measures of other companies. These measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. Accordingly, the Company's computation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies. 
Supplemental Information Regarding Retention Rate and Run Rate 
Retention Rate 
Retention Rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our operating revenues over time. The annual Retention Rate represents the retained subscription Run Rate (subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
The Retention Rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client's final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such notice is not effective until a later date. This annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. This cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100% to derive the annualized Retention Rate for the period. 
B-4• MSCI INC. PROXY STATEMENT 
[BEGIN TABLE]
             ANNEX B 
[END TABLE]
Retention Rate is computed by operating segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. In general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our Retention Rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. In those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancel. In the Analytics and the ESG segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our Index and Real Estate segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. In addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sale of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. We do not calculate Retention Rate for that portion of our Run Rate attributable to assets in index-linked investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes. 
Run Rate 
Run Rate estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements ("Client Contracts") for the next 12 months, assuming all Client Contracts that come up for renewal are renewed and assuming then-current currency exchange rates, subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below. For any Client Contract where fees are linked to an investment product's assets or trading volume/fees, the Run Rate calculation reflects, for ETFs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-ETF products, the most recent client-reported assets. Run Rate does not include fees associated with "one-time" and other non-recurring transactions. In addition, we add to Run Rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute Client Contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. We remove from Run Rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any Client Contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination or non-renewal during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client's final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such notice is not effective until a later date. 
Changes in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in Run Rate. The actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from Run Rate for numerous reasons, including:

• fluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales;

"Organic subscription Run Rate growth" is defined as the period over period Run Rate growth, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and the first year impact of any acquisitions. It is also adjusted for divestitures. Changes in foreign currency are calculated by applying the currency exchange rate from the comparable prior period to current period foreign currency denominated Run Rate.
