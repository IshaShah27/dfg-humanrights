Key features of our compensation philosophy include:

At-Risk Compensation
A significant portion of our executives' compensation is at risk. At-risk compensation includes: annual cash incentive compensation ("bonus"), which is tied to annual financial and individual performance measures; performance-based equity awards, which are paid only if performance metrics established at the beginning of the three-year performance period are met; and time-based equity awards, which vest over a four-year period (collectively, performance and time-based long-term incentive awards are referred to as "LTIs"). As reflected in the following charts, approximately 84% of our CEO's compensation is at risk. Approximately 71% of our other named executive officers' ("NEOs") compensation is at risk.

PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Proposal Summary
We are asking our stockholders to elect three nominees to serve on the Board for a three-year term and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Information about the Board and each director nominee is included in this section. The number of directors is currently fixed at twelve. Upon the retirements of Messrs. Ferguson and Fernandes and Ms. Martin at the 2019 Annual Meeting, and effective upon the election of directors at the 2019 Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will be reduced to nine members.  
Board Recommendation
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each director nominee.  After consideration of each nominee's qualifications, skills and experience, as well as his or her prior contributions to our Board, the Board believes that each nominee should continue to serve on the Board.  
Voting  
Unless contrary instructions are received, the shares represented by a properly executed proxy will be voted "FOR" each of the director nominees presented below. If, at the time of the meeting, one or more of the director nominees has become unavailable to serve, the shares represented by proxies will be voted for the remaining nominees and for any substitute director nominee or nominees designated by the Board unless the size of the Board is reduced. The Board knows of no reason why any of the director nominees will be unavailable or unable to serve.  
Director nominees are elected by a majority of the votes cast. This means that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election must exceed 50% of the number of votes cast for that director's election. Votes cast include votes "for" and votes "against," but excludes any abstentions or broker non-votes. Any nominee who does not receive a majority of votes cast "for" his or her election will be required to tender his or her resignation promptly following the failure to receive the required vote. The Governance Committee will then be required to make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the Board should accept the resignation, and the Board will be required to decide whether to accept the resignation.

Board Leadership Structure
The Company currently has separate persons serving as its Chairman and its Chief Executive Officer, in recognition of the differences between the two roles. The Chief Executive Officer (Mr. Salmirs) has general and active management over the business and affairs of the Company, subject to the control of the Board. The Chairman of our Board (Mr. Kesavan) is charged with presiding over all meetings of the Board and our stockholders, as well as providing advice and counsel to the Chief Executive Officer, coordinating the preparation of agendas, keeping directors informed of matters impacting the Company, and maintaining contact with the Company's General Counsel. The Board believes that at this time, the separation of these roles is the most appropriate and effective leadership structure for the Company and its stockholders.
10     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement
Director Independence
Our Corporate Governance Principles provide that a majority of our directors must be independent; Further, the Committee Charters for our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance Committee require all members be independent, while the Committee Charter for our Strategy and Enterprise Risk Committee requires all members be non-management directors. Each year, our Governance Committee reviews the independence of each of our directors under applicable New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards and considers any current or previous employment relationships as well as any transactions or relationships between our Company and our directors or any members of their immediate families (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner or significant equity holder). The purpose of this review is to determine whether any relationships or transactions exist that preclude a director from being deemed independent under applicable NYSE listing standards or are otherwise inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. 
Our Governance Committee has affirmatively determined and recommended to our Board, and the Board has agreed, that all of our directors, other than our Chief Executive Officer, should be designated as independent. 
The Board's Oversight of Risk Management
Company management is responsible for day-to-day risk management activities. The Board, acting directly and through its committees, is responsible for the oversight of the Company's risk management. Our management has implemented an enterprise risk management (ERM) process designed to work across the Company to identify, assess, govern and manage risks and the Company's response to those risks. 
Our Strategy and Enterprise Risk Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the overall ERM program, including risks relating to operations.
Our Audit Committee oversees risks relating to our accounting, reporting and financial practices, including financial controls, and our compliance with certain legal and regulatory requirements. 
Our Compensation Committee oversees compensation-related risk management, as discussed in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" later in this Proxy Statement. 
Our Governance Committee oversees risks associated with board structure and other corporate governance policies and practices. 
In fulfilling their oversight responsibilities, all committees receive regular reports on their respective areas of responsibility from members of management. Each committee reports regularly to the full Board on its activities, including on matters relating to risk oversight. In addition, the Board participates in regular discussions in executive sessions led by the Chairman of the Board and with the Company's senior management on many key subjects, including strategy, industry group performance, operations, information systems, finance, and legal. 
The Board's Role in Cybersecurity Risk Oversight
Enterprise cybersecurity risk management is an important focus of our Board and its Strategy and Enterprise Risk Committee. As part of their oversight of risk management, the Board and the Strategy and Enterprise Risk Committee each receive regular reports and updates from the Company's Chief Information Officer. Such reports cover the Company's information technology security program, including its current status, capabilities, objectives and plans, as well as the evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.  
Mandatory Retirement
The Board has adopted a mandatory retirement policy for non-employee directors. Under this policy, a director who attains the age of 73 during his or her current term must resign from the Board effective upon the conclusion of the annual stockholders meeting next following his or her 73rd birthday. 
Committees 
The Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Governance Committee and the Strategy and Enterprise Risk Committee. Each committee is composed solely of independent directors, meets periodically throughout the year, reports its actions and recommendations to the Board, receives reports from senior management, meets regularly in executive session, annually evaluates its performance and has the authority to retain outside advisors. Annually, or more frequently, as needed, our Governance Committee reviews 
ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement     11
committee assignments and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to committee membership, taking into consideration each director's qualifications and the desire to refresh committee membership. The primary responsibilities of each committee, as well as membership of each committee, as of the date of this Proxy Statement, are summarized below. Each committee is governed by a charter, which sets forth the applicable responsibilities for each committee.

Board and Committee Attendance in Fiscal Year 2018 
During fiscal year 2018, the Board held eight meetings. Together, the directors attended 99% of the combined total meetings of the full Board and the committees on which they served in fiscal year 2018, and no director attended less than 93% of the combined total meetings of the full Board and the committees on which he or she served in fiscal year 2018. Our Board meets in executive session during each regularly scheduled Board meeting, with the Chairman of the Board presiding at such executive sessions, and may meet in executive session during specially called meetings. 
Our directors attend our annual meetings of stockholders, absent a conflict or other extenuating circumstances. Each of our then serving directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
None of the members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018 or as of the date of this Proxy Statement is or has been an officer or employee of the Company, and no executive officer of the Company served on the compensation committee or board of any company that employed any member of the Company's Compensation Committee or Board.
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018
ABM compensates non-employee directors through a combination of annual cash retainers, fees relating to chairing or serving on a committee, and equity grants. ABM also reimburses its directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending Board and Committee meetings. Equity awards to non-employee directors are granted under our stockholder-approved 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. The Governance Committee reviews the compensation of non-employee directors periodically and recommends changes to the Board whenever it deems appropriate. Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy"), the Compensation Committee's independent consultant, periodically provides information regarding non-employee director compensation to the Governance Committee.

 (2)  The value of stock awards shown in the "Stock Awards" column is based on the grant date fair value computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic No. 718. The grant date fair value of the equity awards shown in the "Stock Awards" column is based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant of the equity award. A director who becomes a Board member following the date of the last held annual meeting of stockholders receives a prorated grant of restricted stock units ("RSUs") based on the date that he or she joined the Board. As Mr. Colleran was named to the Board in September 2018, he received a prorated grant of 1,227 RSUs on September 11, 2018. As Ms. Baker was named to the Board in October 2018, she received a prorated grant of 691 RSUs on December 21, 2018, which was in fiscal year 2019. In addition, each non-employee director who was expected to continue on the Board after the 2018 Annual Meeting received an annual grant on January 4, 2018. For each then-current director, with the exception of Mr. Kesavan, the grant for 2018 on January 4, 2018 was 3,261 RSUs, which was calculated by dividing $125,000 by $38.33. For Mr. Kesavan, the grant for 2018 on January 4, 2018 was 4,565 RSUs, which was calculated by dividing $175,000 by $38.33. Director RSUs granted in fiscal year 2018 vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, except that in the case of a mandatory retirement, RSUs immediately vest upon retirement. RSUs held by each director as of October 31, 2018 were: Ms. Chavez, 14,404; Mr. Colleran, 1,227; Mr. Ferguson, 7,604; Mr. Fernandes, 40,195; Mr. Garcia, 4,912; Mr. Gartland, 6,656; Mr. Kesavan, 8,840; Ms. Martin, 6,656; Mr. Passerini, 4,912; and Ms. Webb, 14,166. As of October 31, 2018, the aggregate number of stock options (relating to grants prior to 2006) held by Ms. Chavez was 6,000. 
 (3)  Amounts shown include value of dividend equivalents (DEUs) credited in fiscal year 2018 with respect to RSUs to non-employee directors. DEUs are settled in Company stock when the underlying RSUs vest. Directors who defer RSUs under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors do not receive DEUs on deferred RSUs until the underlying RSUs are paid out. For Mr. Kesavan, the amount shown includes $689 in family/spousal travel.  
 (4)  Chairman of the Board. 
[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the ABM Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors ("Director Deferred Compensation Plan"). Plan participants may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion of their annual cash retainers and fees until they cease to be members of the Board, or to specified withdrawal dates (at least three years after their election), in accordance with the terms of the Director Deferred Compensation Plan. The amounts held in each director's account are credited with interest quarterly at a rate based on the prime interest rate published in the Wall Street Journal on the last business day coinciding with or next preceding the valuation date. In addition, the Director Deferred Compensation Plan permits directors to defer the settlement of Director RSUs to a date later than the vesting date. 
14     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement
Other Arrangements
ABM has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors. Among other things, these agreements require ABM to indemnify its directors to the fullest extent provided by Delaware law against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with their service as directors. ABM permits non-employee directors who were members of the Board on or before October 31, 2012 to participate in ABM's health benefit plans. Directors who elect to participate pay the entire direct costs of participation in such plans. This benefit is not available to directors who join the Board after October 31, 2012. No directors are currently participating in ABM's health benefit plans.
Director Stock Ownership Policy
Our Director Stock Ownership Policy requires directors to hold common stock (including unvested or deferred RSUs) having a value equivalent to five times his or her annual cash retainer within five years of becoming a director. Under this policy, directors who are not at their targeted stock ownership level within the five-year period must hold at least 50% of any net shares realized until they reach their target. "Net shares realized" means unrestricted shares acquired by a director under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan or acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option, net of any shares sold to pay the exercise price. All directors are either at or above the targeted stock ownership levels or are still within the initial five-year period.
Pursuant to our anti-hedging and pledging policy, none of our directors is permitted to hedge or pledge shares of ABM's common stock.

Proposal Summary
We are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the Company's executive compensation policies and practices as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, accompanying tables and related narrative contained in this Proxy Statement.
Board Recommendation
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the following resolution:
RESOLVED—that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's executives named in the Summary Compensation Table, as disclosed in the Company's 2019 Proxy Statement pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and other executive compensation disclosures.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes our executive compensation program for our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and the three other most highly compensated executive officers who are named in the summary compensation table (collectively, our "NEOs"). Our Compensation Committee (referred to as the "Committee" in this section of the Proxy Statement) oversees all aspects of our NEO compensation. Our NEOs for fiscal year 2018 are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Scott Salmirs, President and Chief Executive Officer 
• D. Anthony Scaglione, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
• Scott J. Giacobbe, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer 
• Rene Jacobsen, Executive Vice President and President, Business & Industry  
• Andrea R. Newborn, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary  
[END TABLE]
OUR COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY AND PRACTICES
Compensation Philosophy
Our objective is to design an executive compensation program that encourages all of our leaders to produce strong financial results and create sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve this, we:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• use evaluation criteria that include both internally measured performance (represented by our performance against our financial targets) and externally measured performance (represented by total stockholder return); 
• place significant weight on long-term equity compensation, thereby tying the total compensation of our executives to the achievement of sustained stockholder value creation; and 
• provide a mix of short-term annual cash incentive compensation and long-term performance-based equity compensation. 
[END TABLE]
Best Practices
Following are some of the best practices we employ in our compensation program.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At-Will Employment.  We do not have fixed-term employment agreements with our NEOs.  
• Clawback Policy.  Our recoupment policy extends to both cash incentive and equity compensation, and permits us to recover incentive compensation paid to executives in connection with a restatement of the Company's financial statements or in cases where the executive's conduct would permit the Company to terminate him or her for "cause." 
• No Single-Trigger Change-in-Control Payments.  We utilize double-trigger change-in-control provisions.  
• No Tax Gross-Ups.  We do not have tax gross-ups. 
• No Hedging or Pledging.  We prohibit hedging and pledging of Company stock.  
• Stock Ownership Guidelines. We require significant stock ownership by our executive officers. 
• Limited Perquisites.  Our executive officers receive limited perquisites.  
• No Unearned Dividends or Dividend Equivalents.  Our executive officers receive dividend equivalents on equity awards only to the extent that the awards are earned.

18     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement 
2018 "Say-on-Pay" Vote Considerations 
In March 2018, our say-on-pay proposal was approved by approximately 94% of votes cast by our stockholders. The Committee and management are committed to strengthening our pay-for-performance correlation, as well as the overall design of our executive compensation program. The Committee and management will continue to use the annual say-on-pay vote as a guidepost for stockholder perspective. 
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Committee is responsible for the design of the Company's executive compensation program, and for reviewing the overall effectiveness of our executive compensation program to ensure the design achieves our objectives. The Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approves CEO annual performance objectives and performance achievement; 
• approves our compensation market analysis process, as well as the companies used for compensation and design comparison purposes; 
• approves performance metrics for our annual and long-term incentive compensation programs; 
• approves non-CEO executive officer compensation, based on recommendations from the CEO; and 
• performs an annual evaluation of risk as it pertains to our Company-wide incentive compensation plans and programs. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the Committee's assessment of the CEO's performance achievement against his performance objectives, the Committee recommends CEO compensation to the independent members of our Board. This recommendation includes base pay levels, cash incentive compensation and equity awards. All elements of CEO pay are approved by such directors.
The Committee generally has the authority to delegate its authority to subcommittees or the Chair of the Committee when it deems appropriate and in the best interests of the Company. The Committee also generally has the authority to delegate such powers and authority as it may determine to be appropriate.
Role of Compensation Consultants
The Committee continued to engage Semler Brossy in fiscal year 2018 to serve as its independent compensation consultant. The Committee takes into consideration the advice of Semler Brossy to inform its decision-making process and has sole authority for retaining and terminating its consultant, as well as approving the terms of engagement, including fees. Semler Brossy works for the Committee and, with the approval of the Committee, has also provided services to the Governance Committee in connection with director compensation matters. Semler Brossy provides no services to the Company. The Committee has determined Semler Brossy to be independent from the Company. The Company's management retains Willis Towers Watson as its primary compensation consultant to advise on program design, apprise management of evolving practices and trends, and perform other consulting services as needed. The Committee also considered the independence of Willis Towers Watson under applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange. From time to time, the Committee may engage other consultants and advisors in connection with various compensation and benefits matters. 
Use of Market Data and Our Compensation Comparator Group
The Committee uses compensation at our comparator group as one of its tools in connection with its assessment of our executive compensation programs and levels of compensation. Working with Semler Brossy, the Committee regularly reviews the various criteria by which it selects the Company's Compensation Comparator Group ("CCG"). Companies in our CCG are generally selected with reference to the following criteria:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• companies, like ABM, that provide business-to-business services, such as outsourcing, logistics management, food service, staffing, and cleaning; 
• companies in other industries that have a high ratio of employees to revenue or market capitalization; and 
• companies that generate annual revenue comparable to ABM. 
[END TABLE]
ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement     19
The Committee's decisions relating to NEO pay are informed by its review of the compensation practices reported in the proxy statements filed by the companies in the CCG. The Committee believes that the proxy data reviewed provides a reasonable indicator of total compensation paid by companies that recruit executives with skill sets similar to those which we seek in our executives. Compensation for our executives is typically managed within the ranges of compensation paid by companies in the CCG. While the Committee normally references the CCG median (50th percentile) for each compensation element, the Committee uses its judgment to determine pay levels necessary to pay for performance and attract and retain executive talent. The Committee places significant weight on individual job performance, experience, compensation history, future potential, internal comparisons, affordability, retention risk, and in the case of executives other than the CEO, the CEO's recommendations.

Pay-for-Performance Alignment
The following graph illustrates three-year realizable compensation of our NEOs compared to the compensation of NEOs in our CCG. Each point on the graph represents three-year realizable compensation of the NEOs in this group relative to his or her company's three-year Total Stockholder Return ("TSR") performance over the 2015–2017 period. ABM's position in this graph shows that the Company's pay for performance is aligned with that of our CCG.
TSR reflects share price appreciation, adjusted for dividends and stock splits.
20     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement 
Realizable pay consists of: (1) actual base salary paid over the three-year period; (2) actual short-term incentive payouts over the three-year period; and (3) the 12/31/2017 market value of equity grants as listed below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in-the-money value of stock options granted over the three-year period; 
• market value of time-vested restricted stock unit grants made over the three-year period based on the stock price at the end of the period; and 
• performance-based incentives: (i) as achieved, for performance cycles that have been completed through 2018; and (ii) as granted, for performance cycles that have not yet been completed, assuming target performance.

[END TABLE]
Using the elements of compensation described above, we structure our program in a way that places a significant portion of our executives' compensation at risk. At-risk compensation includes: annual cash incentive compensation ("bonus") which is tied to annual financial and individual performance measures; performance-based equity awards which are paid only if performance metrics established at the beginning of the three-year performance period are met ("PSUs"); TSR performance shares, which are performance-based awards paid based on the Company's relative TSR performance ("TSR Performance Shares"), and time-based equity awards which vest over a four-year period ("RSUs") and collectively with PSUs and TSR Performance Shares, "LTIs". As reflected in the charts below, approximately 84% of our CEO's compensation is at risk. Approximately 71% of our other NEOs' compensation is at risk.

HOW WE COMPENSATED OUR NEOS IN 2018
2018 Base Salary
The Compensation Committee reviews total compensation, including base salaries, for executives in the first quarter of each fiscal year, and as needed, in connection with recruitment, promotions or other changes in responsibilities. Base salary amounts affect potential annual cash performance incentive payments and equity award grant amounts, since these other compensation elements are based on a percentage of base salary. The following table shows each NEO's 2017 and 2018 base salaries. Annual changes in base salary typically become effective on January 1.

[END TABLE]
The base salaries for our NEOs are reviewed annually when the Compensation Committee reviews its compensation benchmark information. Salary increases for our NEOs for 2018 reflected performance and market-based considerations, including peer group benchmarking. 
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Compensation
Each year, the Committee reviews the Company's strategy and develops an annual cash incentive program ("CIP") that is designed to incentivize behavior that will drive corporate financial objectives ("Financial Objectives"), corporate safety objectives ("Safety Objectives") and individual performance objectives ("Personal Objectives" and together with Financial Objectives and Safety Objectives, "Performance Objectives"), to ensure achievement aligned with the Company's strategic objectives. This process generally begins in the fourth quarter of the preceding fiscal year and culminates in the first quarter of the fiscal year, when Financial Objectives and targets are established by the Board and incorporated into the CIP by the Committee. As part of this process, the Committee reviews the Company's strategic priorities and operating budget and market data, and these factors inform the Committee's decisions with respect to annual incentive opportunities. 
22     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement 
The Committee also establishes the relative weighting of the Financial Objectives, Safety Objectives and Personal Objectives for all NEOs at the beginning of the year. At the end of each year, the Committee conducts an extensive review of our CEO's performance in executive session, with the assistance of Semler Brossy. Our CEO provides the Committee with an assessment of performance for each of the other NEOs. Each assessment takes into account a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, such as the attainment of key strategic goals and the Performance Objectives that were set in the beginning of the fiscal year. After assessing the CEO's performance, the Committee recommends the CEO's cash incentive award to the independent members of the Board, who then determine the CEO's cash incentive award. The Committee also reviews the CEO's assessment of the other NEOs and establishes the cash incentive awards of the other NEOs. 
Each of our NEOs was eligible to earn an annual cash incentive award under the CIP in fiscal year 2018.
2018 Financial and Safety Objectives under Our CIP
Financial Objectives under the CIP in 2018 were established by the Committee in the first quarter of 2018. The Financial Objectives include a combination of adjusted EBITDA margin compared to budget and income from continuing operations compared to budget, to provide balanced measurement across both factors.
Mr. Jacobsen's Financial Objectives also included objectives relating to the overall Commercial Operations and Business & Industry group specifically. All NEOs had Safety Objectives, comprised of numerous metrics relating to promoting a safe working environment. 
At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, the Committee determined that 60% of the cash incentive award opportunity under the CIP for our NEOs would be based on the Company's achievement of Financial Objectives and 10% of the cash incentive award opportunity under the CIP for our NEOs would be based on the Company's achievement of Safety Objectives.  
2018 Personal Objectives under Our CIP 
In the beginning of each year, the Committee establishes Personal Objectives for the CEO in consultation with our Board. The CEO reviews and approves the Personal Objectives for the other NEOs, with the Committee retaining the discretion to change these Personal Objectives. 
At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, the Committee determined that 30% of the cash incentive award opportunity under the CIP for our NEOs would be based on the achievement of Personal Objectives. 
Bonus Targets and CIP Performance Objectives Weighting 
Each NEO's potential CIP award was expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary, including threshold, target and maximum percentages. 
The target bonus potential for each NEO and relative weights for each Performance Objective of the CIP are set forth in the following table. Payout can range from zero to 167.5% of target.

Equity Incentive Compensation
The Committee believes that a long-term incentive program motivates and rewards our executive officers for their contributions to our Company's performance and serves to align long-term compensation with the performance of Company stock. Our practice is to grant long-term incentives annually in the form of equity awards that are allocated among time-based RSUs (25% of total equity grant at target), which typically vest over a four-year period, PSUs (50% of total equity grant at target), which are based on Company financial metrics and typically vest after a three-year performance period, and TSR Performance Shares (25% of total equity grant at target), which are based on comparative total stockholder return metrics and typically vest after a three-year period.
The Committee considers market data and the mix of compensation at risk when establishing the long-term incentive opportunity for each NEO. Generally, the Committee approves an equity award of a specific dollar value for each recipient based on a multiple of the recipient's base salary. The dollar value of the award is determined after taking into consideration various factors, including a market analysis prepared by Semler Brossy and the overall mix of performance-based compensation. The Committee believes that a meaningful portion of equity compensation should be performance-based. The Committee may also grant one-time equity awards when circumstances indicate that such an award is appropriate. 
In fiscal year 2018, our NEOs received grants of equity awards in the form of PSUs, TSR Performance Shares and RSUs, as shown in the table below. In addition, each NEO also holds unvested equity awards granted in prior years, which vest over a period of three or four years from the date of grant (in some circumstances, subject to performance vesting conditions).

Employment and Change-in-Control Agreements
Each of our NEOs have entered into an employment agreement with the Company. The form of agreement reflects an "at-will" employment relationship, while at the same time affording some income security by specifying certain severance payments upon involuntary or constructive termination. Under the terms of these employment agreements, an executive whose employment is terminated without cause by the Company, or who resigns for "good reason" (as such terms are defined in the NEOs' respective employment agreements), will be entitled to receive a multiple (2.5 for Mr. Salmirs and 2.0 for the other NEOs) of the sum of his or her base salary and target bonus, as well as a prorated portion of his or her annual bonus for the year of termination and 18 months of health insurance reimbursements. Additionally, if Messrs. Salmirs, Giacobbe, Jacobsen or Scaglione voluntarily leaves the Company before age 60 and 10 years of service all unvested equity awards made after the effective date of the employment agreement will be forfeited. If Messrs. Salmirs, Giacobbe, Jacobsen or Scaglione voluntarily leaves the Company at age 60 or older with 10 years of service their equity awards granted after the effective date of the employment agreement but at least one year prior to such retirement will continue to vest, in accordance with the terms of those awards. These employment

agreements also provide that following termination of employment for any reason, the officer will refrain from competing with, or soliciting the employees or customers of, the Company for one year following the termination of employment.
In order to assure continuity of ABM's senior management in the event of a potential change-in-control of the Company, ABM provides our NEOs with "double-trigger" severance benefits should their employment with ABM be terminated following a change in control. The current agreements provide double-trigger severance benefits if the officer is terminated without cause, or resigns for "good reason," within two years following a change-in-control. These benefits consist of a lump-sum payment equal to a multiple (3.0 for Mr. Salmirs and 2.5 for each of the other NEOs) of the sum of his or her base salary and target bonus; a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of health and welfare benefits for 18 months; and accelerated vesting of equity awards. There are no excise tax gross-ups under the change-in-control agreements. Instead, any such payments and benefits are subject to reduction in order to avoid the application of the excise tax on "excess parachute payments" under the Internal Revenue Code, but generally only if the reduction would increase the net after-tax amount received by the officer.
For a summary of the executives' employment and change-in-control agreements in effect during fiscal year 2018, see "Potential Benefits on Termination."
Stock Ownership Guidelines and Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policy
The Company has stock ownership guidelines for certain officers, including our NEOs. Executives are expected to achieve their targets within five years of becoming subject to the stock ownership policy. Stock ownership guidelines are based on a multiple of base salary. Individuals who have not met their stock ownership level at the end of the applicable five-year period are expected to retain 50% of their after-tax net shares paid under any Company long-term incentive plan or program, such as shares paid out under the performance share program and vested restricted stock units, until their ownership guidelines are satisfied. The Committee periodically reviews the stock ownership guidelines and may make adjustments to these guidelines to the extent it believes such adjustments are appropriate. Progress toward targeted ownership levels may be taken into consideration in future grants to executives. Unvested RSUs are taken into consideration when determining if ownership guidelines have been achieved; however, unearned PSUs and TSR Performance Shares are not included, nor are stock options, whether vested or unvested. Current stock ownership guidelines are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position  Requirements 
 CEO  Shares with a fair market value equal to six times base salary 
 Executive Vice Presidents  Shares with a fair market value equal to three times base salary 
 Senior Vice Presidents and certain subsidiary senior officers  Shares with a fair market value equal to base salary 
[END TABLE]
All of our NEOs are either at or above our stock ownership guidelines or are well positioned to achieve compliance within the required time period.
Additionally, the Company has a policy prohibiting all employees, including the NEOs and members of our Board, from engaging in any hedging transactions involving our stock. We also prohibit pledging, or using as collateral, Company stock to secure personal loans or other obligations.  
Window Trading and Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans
Under the Company's insider trading policy, officers may purchase or sell ABM securities only during "open window" periods, which begin on the third business day following the date of each quarterly earnings announcement and end at the close of trading on the 15th day of the third month of the fiscal quarter. The only exception to this is for officers who have entered into a trading plan pursuant to SEC Rule 10b5-1.
NEOs are permitted to establish trading plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1 during open trading windows. These plans enable an executive to diversify his or her holdings of Company stock during periods in which the executive would otherwise be unable to buy or sell such stock because he or she possessed material, nonpublic information about the Company. Any trading plan must be submitted in writing to the Company's designated officer for review and approval prior to its effective date.

Annual Compensation-Related Risk Evaluation
We annually review risks associated with our executive compensation program, as well as our other broad-based employee incentive programs, with respect to enterprise risk factors, with the assistance of management's compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, which prepares a risk analysis. The Committee and its independent compensation consultant, Semler Brossy, review this analysis. In connection with its 2018 review, the Committee noted the various ways in which risk is managed or mitigated. Practices and policies mitigating risks included the balance of corporate, business unit and individual weightings in incentive compensation programs, the mix between long-term and short-term incentives, use of stock ownership requirements, the Company's policy prohibiting hedging, and the Company's recoupment or "clawback" policy. Based on this review, the Committee agreed with the findings in the analysis that the Company's compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Compensation Recoupment (Clawback) Policy
The Board has adopted a policy relating to the recoupment of cash and equity compensation. The policy provides that, if the Company's financial statements are the subject of a restatement due to misconduct, fraud or malfeasance, then, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the independent members of the Board, or a committee consisting of independent members of the Board may, in their discretion, recover cash compensation paid to an executive officer of the Company or rescind or make other adjustments to an equity award made to an executive officer of the Company, including recovering cash proceeds relating to the sale or other disposition of an equity award, to the extent that the payment or award was predicated upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement. Where applicable, the Company may seek to recover any amount determined to have been inappropriately received by the individual executive officer. In addition, it is the Board's policy that if the independent members of the Board, or a committee consisting of independent members of the Board, determine that an employee who received a cash incentive payment or an equity award engaged in conduct constituting "cause" (such as serious misconduct, dishonesty, disloyalty, conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or failure to substantially perform employment-related duties or responsibilities), the Board or such committee may take such action it deems necessary to address such conduct, including recovery of cash incentive payments, rescission of equity grants made to the employee in the 36-month period prior to the date on which the Board or such committee makes such determination and recovery of proceeds relating to the sale or other disposition of an equity award during such 36-month period.
Benefits and Perquisites
The NEOs are eligible for customary employee benefits, which include participation in ABM's 401(k) Plan, as well as group life, health and accidental death and disability insurance programs and executive health examinations. These and certain other perquisites are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. 
The NEOs are eligible to participate in ABM's Employee Deferred Compensation Plan, which is an unfunded deferred compensation plan available to highly compensated employees. The Employee Deferred Compensation Plan benefits are shown in the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018" table, followed by a description of the plan. The Committee regularly reviews the benefits provided under this and other plans, and as a result of such a review, in January 2011, the Company entered into a trust agreement that will fund amounts due under the Employee Deferred Compensation Plan in the event of a change in control of ABM.
Accounting and Tax Considerations
The Committee takes into consideration the accounting, tax and related financial implications to the Company and executives when designing compensation and benefit programs. From an accounting perspective, in general, base salary, annual cash incentive payments, and the costs related to benefits and perquisites are recognized as compensation expense at the time they are earned or provided, and equity-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period of the grant. Subject to the exceptions and limits described below, the Company deducts for federal income tax purposes, payments of compensation and other benefits to executives. The Company does not deduct nonqualified deferred compensation until the year that the deferred compensation is paid to the executive. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally does not allow a tax deduction to public companies for compensation paid to certain executive officers in one year over $1 million per executive. Prior to the 2017 tax reform, compensation based solely on the attainment of one or more preestablished objective performance goals (subject to meeting certain other requirements) was exempt from this limit. Our stockholder-approved equity incentive and executive officer incentive plans were designed to permit the Committee to grant certain types of performance-based compensation intended to qualify for this exception from the Section 162(m) limit. However, the exemption for 
30     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement 
performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to transition relief for certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. For ABM, this means that the new Section 162(m) rules will apply starting with the tax year beginning November 1, 2018. 
In August 2018, the Internal Revenue Service issued initial guidance on certain aspects of new Section 162(m) and also indicated that it anticipates proposing rules on new Section 162(m) and requested additional comments from the public. Given the absence of any proposed or final regulations at this time, the Committee will continue to monitor developments in this regard. The Committee continues to have the flexibility to pay nondeductible compensation if it believes that it is in the best interests of the Company.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Committee has reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on its review and discussions with management, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in ABM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 and 2019 Proxy Statement.

 (2)  RSUs. 50% of the RSUs vest on the second anniversary of the grant date and the remainder vest on the fourth anniversary of the grant date. When cash dividends are paid on ABM common stock, DEUs are credited and converted into additional RSUs, subject to the same terms and conditions (including vesting) as the underlying RSUs. The number of RSUs shown includes the dividend equivalents through October 31, 2018. 
 (3)  PSUs (Earned). Amounts shown include PSU awards under the 2016–2018 Performance Share Program that have been "earned" (i.e., the relevant performance period has passed) but remain unvested until the vesting date. PSUs granted under the 2016–2018 Performance Share Program vest, to the extent earned, on January 12, 2019. 
 (4)  PSUs (Unearned). Unearned PSUs are stated at target. PSUs will vest, to the extent earned, following the end of the applicable three-year performance period, on January 10, 2020 and January 10, 2021, as applicable. 
 (5)  TSR Performance Shares (Earned). On September 12, 2016, TSR Performance Shares were granted under the 2016–2018 TSR PSP, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. TSR Performance Shares will vest, to the extent earned, on September 12, 2019.  
 (6)  TSR Performance Shares (Unearned). On September 11, 2017, TSR Performance Shares were granted under the 2017–2019 TSR performance share program and on January 10, 2018, TSR Performance Shares were granted under the 2018–2020 TSR performance share program, each as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Unearned TSR Performance Shares are stated at target. TSR Performance Shares will vest, to the extent earned, on September 11, 2020 and January 10, 2021, respectively. 
 (7)  Amounts shown are based on $30.75 per share, the closing price of ABM common stock on October 31, 2018.

 (3)  Includes amounts included in the Summary Compensation Table for prior years. 
 (4)  Includes fiscal year-end value of shares vested and deferred in prior years; includes dividend equivalents earned on deferred shares.  
[END TABLE]
The Employee Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to make pretax contributions from 1% to 50% of their compensation, including base pay and bonuses. Elections to defer base salary must be made no later than December 31 of the year preceding the year in which deferral begins. Elections to defer performance-based bonuses must be made no later than six months prior to the end of the applicable performance period. Executives may elect to receive distributions from the Employee Deferred Compensation Plan following termination of employment or on specified in-service distribution dates. Distributions may be made in a single lump sum, four annual installments or 10 annual installments, based on earlier elections made in accordance with the plan provisions. In addition, if a participant wants to change his or her distribution, the change cannot be effective for at least 12 months, and the date of payment must be at least five years after the previously scheduled date of distribution. The Employee Deferred Compensation Plan also permits hardship distributions. Deferred amounts earn interest equal to the prime interest rate on the last day of the calendar quarter up to 6%. If the prime rate exceeds 6%, the interest rate is equal to 6% plus one-half of the excess prime rate over 6%. The interest rate is subject to a cap equal to 120% of the long-term applicable federal rate, compounded quarterly.
Certain executives may also elect to defer receipt of RSUs. Elections to defer receipt of RSUs must be made no later than December 31 of the year preceding the year in which any RSUs may be granted. The plan allows participants to defer up to 100% of their RSUs, and receive distributions in a lump sum, four annual installments or 10 annual installments, based on earlier elections made in accordance with plan provisions. 
POTENTIAL BENEFITS ON TERMINATION
During fiscal year 2018, we were party to employment agreements with each of our NEOs, which included severance benefits upon certain terminations, as further described below, and post-employment prohibitions on competition with the Company. We entered into new employment agreements with each of our NEOs, effective in fiscal year 2018, the terms of which are discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The potential payments upon termination described in the following tables are based on the agreements with our NEOs that were in effect on October 31, 2018.
We were also party to change-in-control agreements with each NEO during fiscal year 2018, which provided additional severance benefits in the event of a termination following a change in control. These "double-trigger" change-in-control benefits under our equity plan are described below and did not include any excise tax gross-up. We also entered into new change-in-control agreements with each of our NEOs, effective in fiscal year 2018, the terms of which are described 
36     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The tables below reflect the payments under the change-in-control agreements that were in effect on October 31, 2018.
The following tables and accompanying narrative contain information with respect to potential payments to NEOs upon specified terminations of employment after a change-in-control, resignation or retirement, termination without cause, and death or disability, assuming the termination occurred on October 31, 2018. 
Potential Payments upon Qualifying Terminations of Employment

    (4)  Intrinsic value is based on $30.75 per share, the closing price of ABM common stock on October 31, 2018. For PSUs, amounts shown reflect vesting at target or, where applicable, at achievement levels to date.    
    (5)  Amounts do not include the aggregate balance at fiscal year-end of nonqualified deferred compensation. These amounts are reflected in the above table captioned "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018." Amounts also do not include potential accrued but unused vacation and any unpaid base salary for employment through termination date. Amounts shown are subject to reduction, as described below. Equity grants under our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan vest upon a change-in-control if the recipient is terminated without cause within 24 months following the change-in-control.     
[END TABLE]
The change-in-control agreements with the NEOs in effect during fiscal year 2018 provide that, if a change-in-control occurs, the executive will receive the following benefits upon involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) or resignation for good reason (such as certain specified material changes in position or compensation) prior to the second anniversary of the change-in-control:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump-sum payment equal to a multiple of the sum of base salary and target bonus (which multiple is 3.0 for Mr. Salmirs and 2.5 for each of the other NEOs); 
• a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of health and welfare benefits for 18 months; and 
• a lump-sum payment of any unpaid incentive compensation that was earned, accrued, allocated or awarded for a performance period that ended prior to the termination date, and a lump sum payment of any pro rata portion of any target amount for any unpaid incentive compensation for the performance period in which the termination takes place. 
[END TABLE]
A "change-in-control" of the Company occurs in any of the following scenarios: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• (i) any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act) is or becomes the beneficial owner of more than 35% of the combined voting power of the stock of the Company or succeeds in having nominees as directors elected in an election contest and (ii) within 18 months after either such event, individuals who were members of the Board immediately prior to either such event cease to constitute a majority of the members of the Board; 
• a majority of the Board ceases to be composed of incumbent directors; 
• a merger or similar business combination; 
[END TABLE]
ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement     37
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a sale of substantially all of the Company's assets; or 
• a liquidation of the Company. 
[END TABLE]
None of our NEOs have excise tax gross-ups. Instead, payments and benefits under the change-in-control agreements (as well as under all other agreements or plans covering the NEOs, including any equity award, plan or agreement) are subject to reduction in order to avoid the application of the excise tax on "excess parachute payments," but only if the reduction would increase the net after-tax amount received by the named executive officer (the modified cap), with one exception. The exception is that any reduction may be made to the extent the NEO would be entitled to receive, on a net after-tax basis, at least 90% of the severance payment he or she would otherwise be entitled to under the change-in-control agreement or under any other agreement. In consideration for the protection afforded by the change-in-control agreements, the NEOs agreed to noncompetition provisions. 
Potential Payments upon Retirement 
The following table estimates potential payments for our NEOs if the NEO had retired or, if applicable, resigned from employment with ABM effective October 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  Messrs. Salmirs and Giacobbe are retirement-eligible under the terms of our 2006 Equity Incentive Plan. Intrinsic value is based on $30.75 per share, the closing price of ABM common stock on October 31, 2018. Amounts shown only reflect vesting upon retirement, as unvested equity does not vest upon resignation of employment. For PSUs and TSR Performance Shares, amounts shown reflect vesting at target or, where applicable, at achievement levels to date.    
    (2)  Amounts do not include the aggregate balance at fiscal year-end of nonqualified deferred compensation. These amounts are reflected in the above table captioned "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in Fiscal Year 2018." Amounts also do not include accrued but unused vacation pay and any unpaid base salary for employment through the termination date.    
[END TABLE]
RSUs and stock option grants under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan generally vest monthly pro rata (based on number of months of service over the vesting period) in the event of retirement. An individual who retires during a performance period that has not been completed prior to retirement will generally receive a pro rata number of performance shares (based on the number of months of service over the performance period) on the vesting date for such performance shares, to the extent such performance shares are achieved under applicable performance objectives.
Under the terms of their respective employment agreements in effect during fiscal year 2018, and in connection with a termination by reason of retirement, any equity-based awards received by Messrs. Salmirs, Scaglione, Giacobbe and Jacobsen would continue to be eligible for vesting, exercise and settlement if they were granted at least one year prior to such retirement, on the originally scheduled vesting date.

Equity grants under the 2006 Equity Incentive Plan generally vest monthly pro rata (based on the number of months of service over the vesting period) in the event of death or disability. 
Under the terms of their respective employment agreements in effect during fiscal year 2018, and in connection with a termination by reason of death or disability, Messrs. Salmirs, Scaglione, Giacobbe and Jacobsen and Ms. Newborn would each receive any earned but unpaid cash bonus in respect of any completed fiscal year that has ended prior to the date of death or disability, a prorated target cash bonus based on the length of performance in the performance period, immediate vesting of any equity-based awards subject to time-based restrictions, and immediate vesting of any equity-based awards subject to performance restrictions, with such performance restrictions measured at the target level.
CEO Pay Ratio
In accordance with SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our median employee and the annual total compensation of Mr. Salmirs, our CEO. The 2018 annual total compensation of Mr. Salmirs was $6,022,643; and the 2018 annual total compensation of the median compensated employee (of all our employees who were employed as of September 30, 2018), other than Mr. Salmirs, was $25,620. The ratio of these amounts was 235-to-1.
We believe the pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records. We identified the median compensated employee using base salary and base wages paid in fiscal year 2018, which we annualized for any employee who did not work for the entire year (other than those designated as a temporary, seasonal, or other non-permanent employee on our records). For purposes of identifying the median employee, we converted amounts paid in foreign currencies to U.S. dollars based on the applicable 2018 average exchange rate.
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

PROPOSAL 3—RATIFICATION OF THE
APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Proposal Summary
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019, which ends October 31, 2019. Although the Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee and the Board submit the selected firm to the Company's stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance.  
Board Recommendation
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. 
The Audit Committee has selected KPMG to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. Although action by the stockholders on this matter is not required, the Audit Committee values stockholder views on the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and believes it is appropriate to seek stockholder ratification of this selection. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG, the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm may be reconsidered by the Audit Committee. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time of the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Company has been advised that representatives of KPMG are scheduled to attend the Annual Meeting, and they will have an opportunity to make a statement if the representatives desire to do so. It is expected that the KPMG representatives will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Voting
Unless contrary instructions are received, the shares represented by a properly executed proxy will be voted "FOR" this proposal, which would be your vote to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Common Stock represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal will be considered as an approval of the proposal.

AUDIT-RELATED MATTERS
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee reviews ABM's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board and is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of ABM's independent registered public accounting firm. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the financial reporting process, including the system of internal control over financial reporting. KPMG LLP, ABM's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an independent, integrated audit of ABM's consolidated financial statements and an audit of the effectiveness of ABM's internal control over financial reporting, and for reporting the results of their audit to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews and monitors these processes. 
The Board adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is reviewed periodically by the Audit Committee. The Charter of the Audit Committee is available on ABM's website under "Governance" at http://investor.abm.com/corporate-governance.cfm. Within the framework of its Charter, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair presentation of ABM's results in its fiscal year 2018 consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The management of ABM has affirmed to the Audit Committee that ABM's fiscal year 2018 audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Audit Committee also discussed with ABM's internal auditor and independent registered public accounting firm, the overall scope and plans for their respective audits, their evaluation of ABM's internal control over financial reporting and the overall quality of ABM's financial reporting processes. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from the Company and its management. As part of that review, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed the services provided by ABM's independent registered public accounting firm and has considered whether the provision of these services is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from ABM and its management. 
Based on these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in ABM's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018.

GENERAL INFORMATION
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
Our Board has adopted a written policy and procedures for review and approval or ratification of transactions involving the Company and "related persons." Related persons are directors and executive officers and their immediate family members or shareowners owning 5% or greater of our outstanding common stock and their immediate family members. 
The policy covers any related person transaction that meets the minimum threshold for disclosure in the Proxy Statement under the SEC's rules, specifically, any transaction involving the Company in which: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (i)  the amount involved exceeded $120,000; and 
 (ii)  a related person had a direct or indirect material interest. 
[END TABLE]
Under our policy, transactions with any person who falls into any of the above categories at any time during a fiscal year of the Company are subject to the Policy, even if the person has ceased to have such status during the year.
Our Governance Committee administers our policy with respect to related persons. Under our policy, prior to entering into a transaction, a related person must provide the details of the transaction, including the relationship of the person to the Company, the dollar amount involved and whether the related person or his or her family member has or will have a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, to the Governance Committee. The Governance Committee determines whether the proposed related person transaction should be approved, based on its determination, in its business judgment, of whether such related person transaction is fair and reasonable to the Company and in the best interests of the Company. There were no related person transactions that were required to be submitted for approval during fiscal year 2018.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires ABM's directors, officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of ABM's securities to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based solely on a review of the reporting forms and representations of its directors and officers, ABM believes that since the beginning of fiscal year 2018, all forms required to be filed by its executive officers and directors under Section 16(a) were filed on a timely basis.

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT 
THE PROXY MATERIALS AND THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING
Why did I receive a "Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials" instead of a full set of proxy materials?
We are furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders primarily via "Notice and Access" delivery pursuant to SEC rules. On February 13, 2019, we mailed to our stockholders (other than those who previously requested a printed set) a "Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials" (the "notice") containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials via the Internet. Utilizing this method of proxy delivery expedites receipt of proxy materials by our stockholders, reduces the cost of producing and mailing the full set of proxy materials and helps us contribute to sustainable practices. If you receive a notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the notice instructs you on how to access the proxy materials and vote over the Internet. If you received a notice by mail and would like to receive paper copies of our proxy materials in the mail, you may follow the instruction in the notice for making this request. The notice also contains instructions on how you may request to receive an electronic copy of our proxy materials by email.
When and where will the Annual Meeting be held?
The Meeting will take place on March 27, 2019, beginning at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the Company's corporate headquarters at One Liberty Plaza, 7th Floor, New York, New York 10006.
What do I need to do to attend the Annual Meeting?
All stockholders of record as of the record date, January 30, 2019, or their proxy holders, are welcome to attend the Annual Meeting. If you are voting by mail, by telephone or via the Internet, but still wish to attend the Annual Meeting, follow the instructions on your proxy card or via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com to tell us that you plan to attend. When you arrive at the meeting, please look for the "Stockholders' Welcome Desk," where you will be asked for photo identification in order to receive your admittance card.
If you hold your shares in street name and you decide to attend, you must bring to the meeting a copy of your bank or brokerage statement evidencing your ownership of ABM Industries Incorporated common stock as of the record date. Please go to the "Stockholders' Welcome Desk" and provide the bank or brokerage statement, as well as your photo identification, in order to obtain an admittance card.
No cameras, recording equipment or electronic devices will be permitted in the Annual Meeting. The use of mobile devices, photography or recording of the event is strictly prohibited.
Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting?
Holders of ABM common stock at the close of business on January 30, 2019 are entitled to receive the Notice of the 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and to vote their shares at the Meeting. As of that date, there were 66,210,007 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the Meeting. 
Will my vote be confidential?
Yes. Your vote is confidential and will not be disclosed to our directors or employees.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered in your name with ABM's transfer agent, Computershare, you are the "stockholder of record" of those shares. This Notice of the 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying materials have been provided directly to you by ABM.
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares, and this Notice of the 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any accompanying documents have been provided to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card or by following their instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet.
ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement     49
How do I vote?
You may vote using any of the following methods:
You may vote at the annual meeting by proxy or in person.
If you are a "holder of record" (that is, if your shares are registered in your own name with our transfer agent), you have several options. You may vote by telephone, on the Internet or by attending the meeting and voting in person. In addition, you may vote by mail using the enclosed proxy card.
If you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, if you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other holder of record), the voting instruction card explains which voting options are available to you. As the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you have the right to direct your bank or broker how to vote your shares, and it is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give instructions to your bank or brokerage firm, it will nevertheless be entitled to vote your shares with respect to "routine" items, but it will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to "nonroutine" items. In the case of a nonroutine item, your shares will be considered "broker non-votes" on that proposal. If you want to vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain a power of attorney or proxy from your broker, bank or other holder of record authorizing you to vote. You must bring this power of attorney or proxy to the meeting. 
Your vote is important.
What can I do if I change my mind after I vote?
If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke your proxy before it is exercised by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• giving written notice to our Corporate Secretary; 
• delivering a valid, later-dated proxy, or a later-dated vote by telephone or on the Internet, in a timely manner; or 
• voting by ballot at the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or other holder of record and following their instructions for how to do so.
All shares for which proxies have been properly submitted and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting.
Can I access the 2019 proxy materials and the Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 on the Internet?
This Notice of the 2019 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and the Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 are available on our website at www.abm.com. Instead of receiving future Proxy Statements and accompanying materials by mail, most stockholders can elect to receive an e-mail that will provide electronic links to them. Opting to receive your proxy materials online will conserve natural resources and will save us the cost of producing documents and mailing them to you, and will also give you an electronic link to the proxy voting site.
Stockholders of Record: If you vote on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com, simply follow the prompts to enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service. You also may enroll in the electronic proxy delivery service at any time in the future by going directly to www.proxyvote.com and following the enrollment instructions.
Beneficial Owners: You also may be able to receive copies of these documents electronically. Please check the information provided in the proxy materials sent to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record regarding the availability of this service.
Is there a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
The names of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Meeting will be available, at the Meeting and for 10 days prior to the Meeting for any purpose germane to the Meeting, by contacting our Corporate Secretary between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. at our principal executive offices at One Liberty Plaza, 7th Floor, New York, New York 10006.
50     ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement
What is a broker non-vote?
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, you must instruct the broker how to vote your shares. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." In these cases, the broker can register your shares as being present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under NYSE rules.
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, your broker has discretionary voting authority under NYSE rules to vote your shares on the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. However, your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on the election of directors or the advisory vote to approve executive compensation without instructions from you, in which case a broker non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on these matters.
What is a quorum for the Annual Meeting?
The presence of the holders of stock representing a majority of the voting power of all shares of ABM stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the ABM Annual Meeting, in person or represented by proxy, is necessary to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.
What are the voting requirements to elect the directors and to approve each of the proposals discussed in this Proxy Statement?

If you abstain from voting or there is a broker non-vote on any matter, your abstention or broker non-vote will not affect the outcome of such vote, because abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered to be votes cast under our Bylaws.
Election of Directors
Under our Bylaws and our Corporate Governance Principles, directors must be elected by a majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections, such as the election of directors at the Annual Meeting. This means that the number of shares voted "for" a director's election must exceed 50% of the number of votes cast for that director's election. Votes cast includes votes "for" and votes "against," but excludes any abstentions or broker non-votes. Any nominee who does not receive a majority of votes cast "for" his or her election would be required to tender his or her resignation promptly following the failure to receive the required vote. The Governance Committee would then be required to make a recommendation to the Board as to whether the Board should accept the resignation, and the Board would be required to decide whether to accept the resignation. In a contested election, the required vote would be a plurality of votes cast.
ABM Industries Incorporated 2019 Proxy Statement     51
Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation
Under our Bylaws, the votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes "for" or "against" this proposal.
Ratification of the Appointment of KPMG LLP
Under our Bylaws, the votes cast "for" must exceed the votes cast "against" to approve the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions are not counted as votes "for" or "against" any choice in this proposal.
How will my shares be voted at the Annual Meeting?
At the Meeting, the Proxy Committee appointed by the Board will vote your shares as you instruct. If you sign your proxy card and return it without indicating how you would like to vote your shares, your shares will be voted as the Board recommends, which is:
