PROXY STATEMENT
February 20, 2019
This statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of General American Investors Company, Inc. (hereinafter called the "Company") of proxies to be used at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, to be held at The Century Association, 7 West 43rd Street, New York City, N.Y. 10036, on Wednesday, April 24, 2019 at 11:00 a.m. (and at any adjournments or postponements thereof) for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Stockholders who execute proxies retain the right to revoke them at any time, insofar as they have not been exercised, by written notice to the Secretary of the Company or by attending the Annual Meeting and taking action to revoke such proxies.
The close of business on February 15, 2019 has been fixed as the record date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting.
Proxies returned will be voted in accordance with the instructions thereon or, if no instructions are indicated, in favor of the nominees named herein and to approve the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as auditors.
As of February 15, 2019, the Company had outstanding 25,717,513 shares of Common Stock, $1 par value, and 7,604,687 shares of 5.95% Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B ("Preferred Stock"), $1 par value, each share carrying one vote.
This proxy statement, form of proxy and Annual Report of the Company, including audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, are enclosed in this mailing and are being mailed to stockholders on or about February 22, 2019. The Company will provide, without charge, additional copies of the Annual Report to any stockholder upon request by calling Linda J. Genid, Corporate Secretary of the Company, at 1-800-436-8401.
A quorum will consist of a majority of the shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote on a matter at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy.  The Company intends to treat properly executed proxies that are marked "abstain" or "withhold" as well as any "broker non-votes" as present for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum for the transaction of business.  A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker submits a proxy for the meeting with respect to the election of closed-end fund directors and ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors but does not vote on any "non-routine" matters because the beneficial owner did not provide voting instructions on these matters.  Because of the routine nature of the items of business presented in this proxy statement, the rules of The New York Stock Exchange, Inc. permit member brokers who do not receive instructions from their customers who are beneficial owners of the Company's shares to vote their customers' shares on these items of business and therefore we do not expect any broker non-votes.
The election of the Company's directors requires a plurality of the votes of the shares present or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election.  In the election of directors, votes may be cast in favor of or withheld with respect to any or all nominees; votes that are withheld (and broker non-votes, if any) will be excluded entirely from the vote and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. 
In accordance with Delaware law, only votes cast "for" a matter constitute affirmative votes.  Accordingly, votes that are withheld or abstentions from voting are not votes cast "for" a particular matter, and such votes have the same effect as negative votes or votes "against" a particular matter that requires affirmative votes.

A. Respecting      the Election of Directors 
[END TABLE]
At the meeting, twelve directors are to be elected to hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders next ensuing after their election and until their respective successors are elected and shall have qualified. Ten directors are to be elected by the holders of both the Company's Common Stock and its Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, and two directors are to be elected only by the holders of the Company's Preferred Stock. Directors are to be elected by a plurality of the vote of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on directors. Stockholders vote at the meeting by casting ballots (in person or by proxy) which are tabulated by one or two persons, appointed at the meeting, who serve as Inspectors of Election at the meeting and who execute an oath to discharge their duties. It is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to nominate and to vote such proxy for the election of persons named below or, if any such persons should be unable to serve, for the election of such other person or persons as shall be determined by the persons named in the proxy in accordance with their judgment. Of the twelve persons named below, all are incumbent directors and all have agreed to serve if elected. Information in the following table is as of February 6, 2019.

Each Director's ability to perform his/her duties effectively has been attained in large part through the Director's education, business, consulting or public service positions; and through their experience from service as a member of the Company's Board of Directors, and that of other public companies, non-profit entities, or organizations indicated.

Directors - Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities
Overall responsibility for oversight of the Company rests with the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has appointed Mr. Davidson as its Chairman. The Chairman presides over executive sessions of the Board of Directors, serves between meetings of the Board of Directors as a liaison with other Directors, officers of the Company, counsel, and service providers, as necessary, on a variety of matters. Mr. Davidson also oversees the scheduling of agenda items and subject matter included for discussion at meetings of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has established Audit, Compensation, Executive, Nominating and Pension Committees to assist the Board of Directors in the oversight and management of the Company. From time to time the Board of Directors may establish additional committees or informal working groups to deal with specific matters.
All of the Company's Directors, other than Mr. Priest, are independent Directors, and the Board of Directors believes they are able to provide effective oversight of the Company. In addition to providing feedback and direction during Board of Directors meetings, the Directors meet regularly in executive session and independent Directors chair all committees of the Board of Directors.
The Company's operations entail a variety of risks including investment, administration, valuation, and a range of compliance matters. Although the officers and employees of the Company are responsible for managing these risks on a day-to-day basis within the framework of their established risk management functions, the Board of Directors is responsible for and oversees the risk management processes of the Company. As part of its oversight process, the Board of Directors reviews with officers at Board meetings the levels and types of risks being undertaken by the Company, and the Audit Committee discusses the Company's risk management and controls with the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by the Company. The Board of Directors reviews valuation policies and procedures and the valuations of specific illiquid securities, if owned by the Company. The Board of Directors also receives periodic reports from the Company's Chief Compliance Officer regarding compliance matters relating to the Company and its major service providers, including results of the implementation and testing of the Company's and such providers' compliance programs. The Board of Directors reviews its role in supervising the Company's risk management from time to time and may make changes at its discretion.
The Board of Directors has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate for the Company because it enables the Board of Directors to exercise informed and independent judgment over matters under its purview, allocates responsibility among committees in a manner that fosters effective oversight and allows the Board of Directors to devote appropriate resources to specific issues in a flexible manner as they arise. The Board of Directors periodically reviews its leadership structure as well as its overall structure, composition and functioning and may make changes in its discretion at any time.

This process also involves evaluating individual candidates and making recommendations to the Board with respect to individuals to be nominated to serve as directors. In addition, the Committee will consider nominees recommended by, and respond to related inquiries received from, stockholders. The Committee does not expect to consider self-nominating stockholders. The criteria evaluated and associated with candidates include factors such as judgment, skill, diversity, experience, the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other board members and the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board of Directors. The Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying candidates. All recommendations of a nominee must include biographical data regarding the nominee and the qualifications of the nominee, as well as the basis on which a nominee is or is not an "interested person" of the Company. Recommendations of nominees should be submitted in writing to the Chairman of the Nominating Committee at the office of the Company.

Stockholder                                          Communications with the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors provides a process for the Company's Stockholders to send communications to the Board. This can be accomplished by addressing a communication to the Board of Directors or to one or more individual Directors at the office of the Company. Items marked "personal and confidential" will be forwarded to the addressee, unopened; otherwise, communications will be opened and reviewed by the Company's Corporate Secretary who will draft a response with the assistance of other corporate officers and individual Directors (or the entire Board), as deemed necessary. Copies of responses, together with the related original communication, will be provided to each member of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or individual Directors, as deemed appropriate.
All Directors are encouraged to attend the annual meeting of the Stockholders of the Company. Last year, at the Company's annual meeting held on April 18, 2018, nine of the Directors were in attendance.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's officers and directors and certain other persons to file timely certain reports regarding ownership of, and transactions in, the Company's securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of the required filings must also be furnished to the Company. Based solely on its review of such forms received by it, and amendments thereto, and written representations from certain reporting persons, the Company believes that during 2018 all applicable Section 16 (a) filing requirements were met.
Executive Compensation
The following table sets forth the compensation received during 2018 from the Company by its three highest-paid officers and by its directors.
During 2018, each Director who was not a paid officer of the Company received a fee of $15,000 as an annual retainer, a fee of $1,250 for attendance at each Directors' meeting and a fee of $1,250 for each Committee meeting which he or she attended in his or her capacity as a Director (a fee of $750 if participation was by telephone).
With respect to the Company's Employees' Thrift Plan, the Company matches 150% of an employee's contributions up to 8% of basic salary to the plan. Company contributions are invested in shares of the Company's common stock. An employee's interest in Company contributions to his account is fully vested after six years of service. Partial vesting begins after two years of participation in the plan. All employees, including officers, are eligible to participate in the plan after six months of service with the Company.
The Company has an Employees' Retirement Plan which is broadly characterized as a defined benefit plan. The Company contributes to the trustee for the plan annual costs which include actuarially determined current service costs and amortization of prior service costs. Retirement benefits are based on final average earnings (basic salary and, beginning in 2000, bonuses for non-highly compensated employees, exclusive of overtime, commissions, pension, retainer fees, fees under contracts or any other forms of additional or special compensation, for the five consecutive years in which the participant had the highest basic salary during the last ten years of service) and years of credited service, less an offset for social security covered compensation, plus an additional amount equal to $150 for each year of credited service. All employees, including officers, over age 21 commence participation in the plan after one year of service and are fully vested after six years of service. Partial vesting begins after two years of service. Participants are eligible to receive normal retirement benefits at age 65. In certain instances, a reduced benefit may begin upon retirement between ages 55 and 65 from the tax qualified plan.
The Company also has Excess Contribution and Excess Benefit Plans. Under such plans, the Company may establish accounting reserves and make payments directly to selected participants in the Company's Thrift and Retirement Plans, respectively, to the extent the levels of contributions or benefits for such participants under such plans are limited by sections 415, 416 and/or 401(a) (17) of the Internal Revenue Code. Messrs. Priest, Vindigni, and Majmudar are participants in both the Excess Contribution and Excess Benefit Plans.
The following table shows the estimated annual retirement benefits (including amounts attributable to the Company's Excess Benefit Plan, as described below), which are subject to a deduction based on a portion of social security covered compensation, payable on a straight life annuity basis, at normal retirement date to all eligible employees, including officers, in specified compensation and years-of-service classifications: 
For each of the officers of the Company listed in the compensation table on page 10, the following indicates his/her years of credited service in the Company's Retirement Plan and basic salary for 2018: Messrs. Priest (8) $650,000, Vindigni (30) $425,000, and Majmudar (6) $325,000.
The Board of Directors unanimously believes that your vote "FOR" all of the Board's twelve nominees as directors will be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
B. Respecting the Ratification and Approval      of Appointment of Auditors by the Board of Directors 
[END TABLE]
Proposal (B) set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders is the ratification or rejection of the action taken in the following resolutions unanimously adopted by the Board of Directors (a majority of non-interested directors voting in person) approving the appointment by the Audit Committee of the Company of the firm of Ernst & Young LLP to be the auditors of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
"RESOLVED, that the appointment by the Audit Committee of the firm of Ernst & Young LLP to be the auditors of the Company with respect to its operations for the year 2019 be and it hereby is approved; and further
"RESOLVED, that such auditors be, and they hereby are, authorized and instructed to conduct an audit, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, of the financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ending December 31, 2019; and further
"RESOLVED, that such auditors be, and they hereby are, authorized and instructed to conduct an executive review of the interim financial statements of the Company as of and for the six months ending June 30, 2019; and further
"RESOLVED, that such appointment shall terminate (without penalty to the Company) in the event that it shall be rejected at the annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company in 2019; and further
"RESOLVED, that such appointment shall terminate (without penalty to the Company) if a majority (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) of the outstanding voting securities of the Company at any meeting called for the purpose shall vote to terminate such appointment; and further
"RESOLVED, that the report of such auditors expressing their opinion with respect to the financial statements described above shall be addressed to the Board of Directors of the Company and to the stockholders thereof."
While the rules under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, would permit the Company not to submit to stockholders the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's auditors, it is being done because it continues the Company's long-standing practice to do so and the Company believes that it is good corporate practice. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain Ernst & Young LLP, but may determine nonetheless to continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP.

C. Respecting Other Matters      Which May Come Before the Meeting and Deadlines for the 2020 Annual Meeting 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors of the Company does not know of any other matters which may come before the meeting. However, if any other matters, of which the Board of Directors is not now aware, are properly presented for action before the meeting, including any questions as to the adjournment or postponement of the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote such proxy in accordance with their judgment on such matters.
In order for a stockholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in the Company's proxy material relating to its 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholder proposal must be received by the Company no later than October 24, 2019, and must comply with certain other rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, for stockholder proposals or director nominations that a stockholder seeks to bring before the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders but does not seek to have included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting, the following requirements apply: Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, in order for stockholder proposals or nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought before the 2020 annual meeting, any such stockholder proposal or nomination (including in the case of a nomination, the information required by the Company's advance notice Bylaws provisions) must be received at the office of the Company no earlier than November 26, 2019 and no later than December 26, 2019. The Company's advance notice Bylaw requirements are separate from, and in addition to, the Securities and Exchange Commission's requirements (including the timing requirements described in the preceding paragraph) that a stockholder must meet in order to have a stockholder proposal included in the proxy statement. Should the Company determine to allow a stockholder proposal that is received by the Company after December 26, 2019 to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting, the persons named as appointees in the form accompanying the proxy statement for such meeting will have discretionary voting authority with respect to such stockholder proposal.
In accordance with a notice sent to certain stockholders of the Company, who share a single address, only one copy of the proxy statement and our 2018 Annual Report is being sent to that address unless we received contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. However, if any stockholder residing at such an address wishes to receive a separate copy of this proxy statement or our 2018 Annual Report, he or she may contact us at:
General American Investors Company, Inc.
530 Fifth Avenue, 26th Floor
New York, N.Y. 10036
Attn: Linda J. Genid, Corporate Secretary
Telephone: 1-800-436-8401
E-mail: InvestorRelations@gainv.com and we will deliver those documents to such stockholder promptly upon receiving the request. Any such stockholder may also contact Ms. Genid, if he or she would like to receive separate proxy statements and annual reports in the future and to revoke his or her consent to householding. If any stockholder revokes his or her consent, we will begin sending such stockholder individual copies of these documents within 30 days after we receive the revocation notice. If you are receiving multiple copies of our annual report and proxy statement, you may request householding in the future by contacting our Corporate Secretary.
The expense of the solicitation of proxies for this meeting will be borne by the Company. In addition to the use of mails, proxy solicitations may be made by telephone, internet or personal discussion with certain of the Company's Officers and Directors for which they will not receive any separate compensation. In addition to mailing copies of this material to stockholders, the Company will request persons who hold stock for others (in their names, in custody, or in the names of nominees) to forward copies of such material to those persons and to request authority for the execution of the proxies.
The Company may, under certain circumstances, reimburse such persons for their out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection therewith.
It is important that proxies be returned promptly. Therefore, stockholders who do not expect to attend in person and who wish their stock to be voted are urged to fill in, sign and return the accompanying form of proxy in the enclosed envelope.

Report of the Audit Committee ofThe Board of Directors of General American Investors Company, Inc.
The purposes of the Company's Audit Committee are set forth in the Committee's Charter. The purposes include assisting the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company's financial reporting process and internal controls, the Company's financial statements and the selection of the Company's independent auditors. Management, however, is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements, and the independent auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits and reviews.
In connection with the audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 included in the Company's Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Annual Report"), at a meeting held on February 6, 2019, the Audit Committee considered and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors, and discussed the audit of such financial statements with the independent auditors.
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors the quality, and not just the acceptability under generally accepted accounting principles, of the accounting principles applied by the Company, and such other matters brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by the independent auditors required by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee also received from the independent auditors the written disclosures and the letter required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3600T, considered whether the provision of nonaudit services by the independent auditors is compatible with maintaining the auditors' independence and discussed with the auditors the auditors' independence.
The members of the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not experts in the fields of accounting or auditing, including in respect of auditor independence. Moreover, the Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the independent auditors. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States or that the Company's auditors are in fact "independent."
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and the independent auditors and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Committee's Charter and those discussed above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report.
